I reran the experiment (with the new SpamHam1.pik, but it doesn't seem to make a difference).

The first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-).  It has lots of HTML clues that are apparently ignored.

Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert into apt and let loose... :) Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC.

Folks,

     There have been several major internet outages this morning,
     across major providers UUNet, Genuity, and god knows who else.
     Various routes across the Internet backbones have been
     disappearing, repropagating, and disappearing again.

     This has caused and exacerbated several problems which we are
     working on correcting right now.  We apologize for the
     inconvenience..

  So if you want to adjust the initial connect timeout,

I'm still seeing this.  It reports to honor.cloudmark.com but checks

I noticed a low count of razor'd spam messages. So after digging, if I
razor-report a message the diags say that it was accepted but if I turn
around and run a check on the exact same message that was reported, then
it doesn't find the sig and as such isn't spam.

Is it just me or has there been a massive increase in the amount of email 
being falsely bounced around the place? I've already received email from a 
number of people I don't know, asking why I am sending them email. These 
can be explained by servers from Russia and elsewhere. Coupled with the 
false emails I received myself, it's really starting to annoy me. Am I the

###  **Government Personal and Business Grants Facts:**

**Over 20 Million People Get Government Money Every Year:**

1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money to start or expand a business

4,000,000 people get money to invest in real estate

6,000,000 people get money to go to college

10,000,000 people get free help and training for a better job

It sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source of
free business help delivers:

Over $30 billion dollars in free business grants and low-interest loans;

over one-half trillion dollars in procurement contracts; and

over $32 billion dollars in FREE consulting and research grants.

> With an economy that remains unpredictable, and a need for even greater

In spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly huge
that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for an equal
share, they would each receive over $70,000.

Most people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who to
contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do receive
FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you should also.

It seemed that way to me when I ripped the classifier out of it -- I don't

Someone else will have to answer that (I don't use GBayes or hammie, at

That's been done now, right?

Those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they're
interesting.  The tiny spam/ham collections in GBayes are also worthless
now.  The ""self test"" feature didn't do anything except print its results;
Tester.py since became doctest'ed and verifies that some basic machinery

I would question anything being ready for ""production"" being in
STABLE.

He's kept backwards compatibility with ipfw, which is major plus.

My point about IPFW2 being rolled out into stable was merely an
illustration of the fact that ipfw is indeed not ipfilter, and that
there are no license issues there :)

Trying to shoutdown a speaker or being loud and rowdy while someone else is
trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
at worst.

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code",0,1

My question for the trust system is this. I signed up for a free account

on some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of
data, 
and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The
mailing 
includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few 
links to their book store.

This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, 
and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them
might 
be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even 
includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the 
next mail is still flagged as spam.

Who is losing a trust rating here? If it is not unsolicited commercial
e- mail, it should not be reported by Razor as spam -- correct?

Three former executives from real estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal  charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into  AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate drama you'll get this week without renting ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail), the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but unknown). The big accusation here is ""round tripping,"" in which Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, ""thus allowing Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own cash,"" explained the Wall Street Journal. Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush  administration really means it about this corporate clean-up thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with ""a major media company."" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with, observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float.   The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another company; his boss got booted last month for possible book-cooking.  So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that  make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but  that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. -  Jen Muehlbauer Homestore Executives Agree to Guilty Pleas  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3165-2002Sep25.html Homestore, AOL Ad Deals Yield Guilty Pleas (USA Today) http://tinyurl.com/1nbz U.S. Focuses on Executive at Homestore http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/technology/26AOL.html Homestore's Ex-Execs to Aid Investigators http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-homestore26sep26,0,5107257.story Probe of Homestore Turns To an Ex-AOL Executive http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1032971619118707713,00.html (Paid registration required.)

The media can't figure it out. Can CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou? His fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the vilified Jean-Marie Messier. Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24  paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.   The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still  had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation."" There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu,  an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake  in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom, via its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote. To confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone conference.  The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier. ""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his  head.""  With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's viability again in doubt?

Three former executives from real estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate drama you'll get this week without renting ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail), the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but unknown). The big accusation here is ""round tripping,"" in which Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, ""thus allowing Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own cash,"" explained the Wall Street Journal. Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush administration really means it about this corporate clean-up thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with ""a major media company."" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with, observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float. The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another company; his boss got booted last month for possible book-cooking. So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. - Jen Muehlbauer Homestore Executives Agree to Guilty Pleas  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3165-2002Sep25.html  Homestore, AOL Ad Deals Yield Guilty Pleas (USA Today) http://tinyurl.com/1nbz  U.S. Focuses on Executive at Homestore http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/technology/26AOL.html  Homestore's Ex-Execs to Aid Investigators http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-homestore26sep26,0,5107257.story  Probe of Homestore Turns To an Ex-AOL Executive http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1032971619118707713,00.html  (Paid registration required.)

The media can't figure it out. Can CEO Jean-René Fourtou? His fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the vilified Jean-Marie Messier. Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24 paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.  The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation."" There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu, an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom, via its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote. To confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone conference.  The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier. ""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his head.""  With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's viability again in doubt? Outlets today report that Enron's logo, the oversize capital ""E"" that stood outside its headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000.

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has  been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to  sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a  one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages  removed.

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and  Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it  only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the  ""Exmh_Debug Reading $filename"" output in the debug log to see when sequences  are actually reread from disk. My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to  investigate that. >   | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less  >   | than 48 hours. >  > Have a good vacation. Thanks.

I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. Read this email to the end, follow the instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25 going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing this same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why that day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close to imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor. Read on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical. Not only are you making money from your own business, you're helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams. Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get AT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital. Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN): ================================================== Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the business potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money. Their findings proved that there are ""absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only $25 in startup costs."" DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU WILL MAKE. This is what one had to say: ""I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but each time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out that night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed. Two weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars rolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back. Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find $580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I just bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week. Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?"" Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never believed in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to win the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I felt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other $25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions meticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back. As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled my $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and that's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already up $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped. On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I always say that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant to be, maybe it is for you too. Just stick to the steps, do everything it says - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - I promise."" Greg Moran, Boston, MA.

Not only do these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture, you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT http://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to plug in your own numbers and see the results. METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports. Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you. $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. **ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET: Cash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole proprietors.  However, this program will only work if you are willing to put in the time and effort to make it work.  This is not a program for everybody.

An old man lived alone in Minnesota. He wanted to spade his potato garden, but it was very hard work.  His only son, who would have helped him, was in Prison. The old man  wrote a  letter to his son and mentioned his predicament.  Shortly, he received this reply, ""For heaven's sake Dad, don't dig up  that garden, that's where I buried the GUNS!""  At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen police showed up and dug up the old man's entire garden, without finding any guns.  Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what happened, and asking him what to do next.  His son's reply was: ""Now plant your potatoes, Dad.

Looks great! One note: most ""image-only"" spam actually has some text (a few 
words at the top, a disclaimer at the end) so keep that in mind. The typical 
image spam that slips through SA seems to have a bit of text, one huge image, 
then a bit more.

Q&A: Chip off the old block; Bells and whistles; Mortarboard. 5. Endnote. 6. Subscription commands. 7. Contact addresses. 1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family ------------------------------------------------------------------- Historically, families have usually had more children than parents, resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in recent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the number of children per generation has steadily gone down, while life span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree that some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin, with few people in each generation. The term ""beanpole family"" has been around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it rarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to wider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it too slangy and prefer the jargon term ""verticalised"" to describe such families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal relationships within the family and (for example) the role of grandparents. The rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the 'beanpole' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in divorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single child.                                              [""Observer"", May 2002] Noting the rising number of so-called 'beanpole' families in Britain (families with only one child), the report warns that a child without siblings 'is starved of the companionship of family members of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation, with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life'.                                             [""Guardian"", June 2002] 2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl ------------------------------------------------------------------- A stupid person, a blockhead. Unfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped out of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it that I can find is in the classic W C Fields film ""The Bank Dick"" of 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line: ""Surely, don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a jabbernow, you're not those, are you?"". Before that, it turns up in one of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems to have been rather rare. It's from the old French ""jobard"", from ""jobe"", silly. That word was then added to ""noll"", the top or crown of the head, the noddle. The first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within. ""Jobbernowlism"" is the condition or state of being a ""jobbernowl"", or an act or remark that is especially stupid. Careful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber! 3. Beyond Words ------------------------------------------------------------------- I've been away at a heritage conference in Colchester these past few days. On my way back, my eye was caught by this warning sign posted above some steps at the local railway station:    Caution    Do not run on the stairs    Use the hand rail 4.

For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer electronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come across the expression ""bells and whistles"", which seem to relate to equipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work. Is that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve Castelain, France] Q. You're right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to gimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function. The phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the American military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in an article in ""Atlantic"" in October 1982, which said it was ""Pentagon slang for extravagant frills"". There's some evidence that the term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early evidence is sparse. Where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth century, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before modern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud warning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam made the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the noisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans will agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at one time ""clang, clang, clang went the trolley"" in large numbers of American cities. At least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and whistles, as this extract from an article in ""Appleton's Journal"" of 1876 shows:   You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping   along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky   height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by   two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and   whistles seems like the small diversions of very little   children, so diminished are they by the distance. Could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought excessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a frill? Possibly. But it's more probable the slang sense of the term comes from that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre organ. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to help the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns, sirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and organs often had ""toy counters"" with 20 or more noisemakers on them, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades after the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still common in big movie houses, these fun features must have been considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but mere fripperies, inessential add-ons. It's possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up especially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities to add them are so great.                         ----------- Q. The designation of ""robes"" for academic dress clearly comes from its origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about ""mortarboards""? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or 13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does ""mortarboard"" refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient? A. The academic cap often called a ""mortarboard"" is quite ancient, but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth century (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a ""square""). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually with a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts of mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually call it a hawk. What seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between the brickie's board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at Oxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our first recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, ""The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman"" by a clergyman named Edward Bradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names of the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school). Verdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book recounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don appears after one such escapade: ""I will overlook your offence in assuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave the offensive epithet of 'mortar-board'; more especially, as you acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have known better"". After a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more than 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley invented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly popularised it.                         ----------- Q. I got into a discussion about ""chip off the old block"" with friends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting, jewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this term mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan] A. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely made of wood. The first form of the expression was ""chip of the same block"", meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as somebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage. An early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time Bishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: ""Am not I a child of the same Adam ... a chip of the same block, with him?"". Later that century, another form is recorded ""a chip of the old block"", which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his father, or continued some family characteristic. At some point, probably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to ""a chip off the old block"", which does nothing to change the sense, but is the way it's now usually written or said. 5.

That got a good laugh out of me.   Just saying ""crucial hair feature"" 
improves my day immeasurably.

I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting 
thing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   
One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.
Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.

I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 
getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 
improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance.   Interesting 
isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 
often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 
but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 
creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.

I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 
working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness.""   I flinched from 
that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 
talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 
party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 
on the net all you have is a photo.....

You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 
not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.
(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)
It's too easy to say ""Oh, no!  He's a geek!""   or ""She's a CAT person, 
ick!"" when you might have a great time together.

We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 
tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
exposure shrinks after school.

Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 
work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 
doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.

An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating
Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in 
the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think 
it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a 
project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.
It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much ""interview"" context 
and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 
though. 

I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 
you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is 
actually sound.

I'm not sure that I follow your reasoning here. Razor isn't your mail 
server. It doesn't keep in your mail. You don't request your mail there. 
Nor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their 
mail. My setup check a mail against Razor when my server receives it, 
not when I'm going to read it. If you wait to get 1000 reply for a mail, 
it means you have to wait for 1000 people to read it (at least, some 
people may not vote because they don't want to vote that day or because 
they don't think it's spam). Knowing that about half the planet would be 
sleeping (night time) and thus not reading their mail, it would mean 
that at least 2000 people already received the mail in their inbox. 
Knowing that, among the people who are not sleeping, not all of them are 
constantly reading their mail. I would say that less than 1 people over 
10 read their mail as soon as it arrives. That means that 20,000 people 
already recieved the mail and checked it against the Razor database 
before you would get your 1000 votes.

Also, with your system, 99% is the best you could get. If you wait for 
only one vote, maybe only 20 guy would read the mail (1 to vote, 10 
sleeping, and 9 not reading their mail soon enough). Wich gives a value 
99.98%. That's far better than your 99% don't you think.
In RealLife(tm), most likely one guy voting won't be enough but the 
thing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible.

Also, if for some reason, this mail is one of those people don't agree 
on whether it is spam or not, it would take a while to revoke those 1000 
reports, which means that some people may lose this legitimate (to them) 
mail.

You mentioned that with this system, people will re-report less often. 
First, I don't see how waiting *longer* before making a decision on the 
legitimacy of a mail will reduce re-reporting. The more you wait, the 
more people will get the mail in their inbox, the more people will see 
the mail (again, not everybody check their mail against Razor at read 
time, most do it a reception time using procmail/spamassassin). Second, 
re-reporting has its use, it increase the confidence that a mail is spam.

So I don't see what you gain with your 1000 people.

  FBI warns about wireless craze


  Some FBI agents are worried about warchalking

  Well-meaning wireless activists have caught the attention of the US Federal Bureau
  of Investigation. 
  One of its agents has issued a warning about the popular practice of using chalk marks
  to show the location of wireless networks. 

  The marks, or ""warchalks"", are cropping up in cities and suburbs across the world. 

  The FBI is now telling companies that, if they see the chalk marks outside their
  offices, they should check the security of wireless networks and ensure they remain
  closed to outsiders. 

  Top marks 

  The warchalking phenomena is only a couple of months old but it has generated a huge
  amount of interest. 

  The idea behind warchalking is to use a standardised set of symbols to mark the
  existence of wireless networks that anyone can use to go online. 

  Many community groups and local governments, and even some public-spirited
  companies, are setting up wireless nodes that give people fast net access. 


  This symbol denotes a closed wireless node 

  The wireless networks replace computer cables with radio and are usually very easy to
  set up and connect to. 

  Before now many curious hackers have gone on ""wardriving"" expeditions which
  involve them driving around an area logging the location of the wireless networks. 

  Many companies using wireless do not do enough to make them secure and stop people
  outside the organisation using them. 

  So the FBI is issuing advice to companies to be on the lookout for warchalk marks as a
  pointer to the security of their wireless network. 

  ""If you notice these symbols at your place of business, it is likely your network has
  been identified publicly,"" warns the guidance from the FBI. 

  Scare stories? 

  The agent who circulated the warning in Pittsburgh said it was not an official FBI
  advisory or policy but was information worth passing on. 

  He urged anyone using a wireless network to ensure that it was secure and used only by
  those a company wants to access it. 

  Warchalkers have questioned the scare stories surrounding the phenomena, saying that
  anyone with malicious intent is unlikely to publicly mark their target. 

  The phrases ""wardriving"" and ""warchalking"" derive from the early days of computer
  hacking when curious users programmed their computers to search for all phone lines
  that returned data tones. The exhaustive searching was known as ""wardialling"".

So here's the final report on the HD/ID party. As no less than TEN 
forkers pointed out, the invitation, while sent on Sunday 6/30, was only 
delivered ten days later on 7/9.

It got flagged as spam.

Yes, on a mailing list awash in crap -- and some it is even unsolicited 
commercial email, heavens! -- our trusty mailman filters captured and 
quarantined just two posts that week, one from me that was > 100K (the 
fat articles) and one that was bcc:d (the invite).

Now, it was a little difficult to recalibrate self-esteem, which as you 
can imagine was proportional to the two-digit attendance  -- in binary!

According to the George Washington documentary, I almost had as much 
alcohol on hand than he did -- Virginia tradition being to copiously 
lubricate each voter. Election day was a public festival day, and it 
cost poor George an average of SIXTY-FOUR shots of hard liquor PER VOTER 
that day...

So, herewith is the prize for most appropriate flame my delayed invite 
got:

One of our competitors added:

And there is no prize for guessing which cold, dark forks emitted these 
two plaints:

 From Whiny Dwarf:

And Angry Dwarf:

Perhaps I should remind the latter gently that it was not in any way his 
fault. The universe *was* out to get him!

And finally, here's an object lesson for all ye of little faith to learn 
from my sins:

Yes, boys and girls, Mr. Assassin, like Mr. Lott, gets very annoyed if

PS. This is the obscure footnote where I actually hide the bits in this 
post. What we just encountered here is that an event-processing system 
with a 10-day RTT cannot be used to reliably handle events more often 
than once every 20 days. That's why I waited to reply. six bonus points 
to anyone who can prove this hunch of mine. Hint: try analyzing the

Date: Not supplied

A San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 


    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... 

    So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.

Date: Not supplied

Great article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use. 

    For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population. 

    The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.

Thanks that helps.  There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works.  I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100"" which I thought would be zero.   So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up.  Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level.  Now here come the questions... What engine signature does TES look at?  Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures.  How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases?  How many revokes decreases someones rating?  Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message?

Bobby,  Couple of things:  If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting. Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user). apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate. cheers, vipul.

I need to ask a question concerning this issue.

What if I don't want to get rid of the MBR -- it will destroy the OS
on that drive.  How do I remove lilo without the above fdisk

but that's just stupid.  microsoft s/w covers a subset of applications
that are under the gpl.  there are gpl word processors, there's a
microsoft wp; there are various language compilers and interpreters under
the gpl, microsoft has their visual compilers.  and so on.  and just
like the gpl apps, the microsoft apps are distributed under a license.
that license says lots of things, and there are various licenses used by
microsoft, but in a nutshell they all pretty much say: you can't copy,
distribute or modify their s/w; you can't sell it multiple times.

so does anyone think that applies to their wp documents or their visual
c++ code?

Making a mesh on the move

A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
reports Peter Rojas

Peter Rojas
Thursday August 29, 2002
The Guardian

Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.

This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
dream.

Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
antennas, and improving wireless coverage.

As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
networking may be inevitable.

Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.

The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
connection.

Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
software.

It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
acquiring 3G licences.

All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
networks.

But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.

At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
their favourite songs, movies, and video games.

But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
enterprise networks.

The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.

When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.",0,1

Just for the record mc has a nice directory

Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:

This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,
with RC files in init.d etc.

It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.

Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?

  Based on your description the whole thing would be 1 part.

  If your mail contains a fwd of a mail *inline* with mime boundaries, 
  then your mail is all consindered to be just text.  If you fwd

To all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of
apologies. I mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio
section, causing quite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they
just released a double album this year and have been touring in support of
that release. For today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is
the N'SYNC breakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking).

I know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is
awesome. I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm
sure it would be better on a color screen, like the Treo 270, but for what
I'll need, this works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can
install, so that remote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is
the base station's use of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose
they were cutting costs.

I'm also scoping out the Palm Markup Language (PML) standard for marking up
Palm Docs, in an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier. I've
installed several of the files on my phone and while they are easy to read,
have all the content organized, and function as useful tips for the various
subjects, I'd like to add some minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look
even better for me and anyone else who reads them on their Palm.

http://www.tomeraider.com/

Of the formats Lockergnome uses for our GnomeTomes, TomeRaider is by far my
favorite. Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy to
read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, allowing
you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) with much
greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. The Windows
version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in mind. Creating
ebooks for TomeRaider is a simple matter of combining a modified set of HTML
tags with the  designation for page breaks. The only trick for Yankees like me
is remembering that center is tagged centre in the software.

Triumph the dog is low-tech, he's not cute like the pets.com sock puppet, but
he manages to maintain a twisted appeal to fans of lowbrow comedy. In this
segment, Triumph makes a mockery of geeks standing in line for Episode II.
Whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've never understood
why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, you'll still find this
film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary to get the point across, yet
Triumph delivers enough one-liners throughout to keep you watching all the way

**Heleen van den Hombergh**

http://www.heleenvandenhombergh.com/  
http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/378/heleen_van_den_hombergh.html

Classic jazz vocal styling, juxtaposing arrangements of contemporary pieces
with arrangements of jazz standards. Combined with some beautiful piano
arrangements, Heleen's voice is a thing of beauty. A Netherlands native, who
originally dreamed of saving the rainforests (at least according to her
biography), her interpretation of American jazz standards and show tunes is
more remarkable than most native English speaking vocalists. No world tour is
currently scheduled, so you'll probably have to journey to Europe to see her
in person, but for those of you living elsewhere in the world, the Internet
makes a fabulous venue for experiencing Heleen van den Hombergh's talent.

Special DVD Features worth a look-Thornton and Coen Brothers Commentary

Much more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, The Man Who
Wasn't There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. Ed Crane
(Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade, Crane
represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but truly knows
nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by the retelling. He
gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations. Left to guess at the
motivations and desires of those around him, Crane develops an indifference to
it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers into town, Crane takes this
opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish the punishers. As indifferent as
Crane appears, he is no match for the amorality of fate. As much as fate is
indifferent in its wrath, however, so is it artistic in its execution. That is
what makes our lives so entertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never
as expected. The Man Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an
individual's year to turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of
cuter, more recent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their
earlier noir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand
does an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James Gandolfini
exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding performances, however,
rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as pompus attorney Freddy
Riedenschneider and Jon Polito as the snake oil salesman impress and entertain
as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their characters. The black and white
cinematography by Roger Deakins also impresses and precisely underscores the
bleakness of Crane's life and the monochromatic nature of fate.

[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the article I was commenting on... Rohit] In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like. The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article. Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest of the Web? To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project. On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind... Best,    Rohit Khare =========================================================== The search goes on China backtracks on banning Googleup to a point Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING  From The Economist print edition IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population of Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparently because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been restored. An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites. After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site to far less powerful search engines in China. Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on Google for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.",0,1

diary.codemonkey.org.uk [Dave Jones]:
 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.

that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :(

(Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...

An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written 
evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the 
infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is 
enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* 
FAQ) and ""eyewitness"" reporting without a single written source. What 
the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest 
attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much 
more skeptical if the ""quote"" emerged after his death... RK

===============================================================
http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm

""A billion here, a billion there . . .""

Did Dirksen ever say, "" A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon 
you're talking real money""? (or anything very close to that?)

Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio 
records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found 
no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to 
him.

Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics 
showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote 
or its variations.

Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed 
""Ev and Charlie"" and ""Ev and Jerry"" shows, all newspapers clippings in 
the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, 
transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of 
Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the 
Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.

Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to 
rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular 
turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or 
excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word ""pothole"" to 
remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to 
the debt ceiling:


""As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make 
the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were 
working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got 
through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to 
the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic 
hazard.

""Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a 
conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and 
said, I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth 
and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'"" 
[Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].


On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another ""spending"" story, 
one he labeled ""cat in the well"":


""One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story 
about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, Johnny, a cat 
fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and 
then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the 
well?'

""Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a 
while, and then when the teacher came down and said, How are you 
getting along?' Johnny said, Teacher, if you give me another slate and 
a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes 
I can land that cat in hell.'

""If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do 
not find much to cheer about concerning it."" [Congressional Record, June 
16, 1965, p. 13884].


But there are no such reminders for the ""A billion here, a billion 
there . . . "" tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's 
note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt 
ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no 
authoritative reference to the ""billion"" phrase.

The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from 
people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for 
example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as 
evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard 
Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But 
cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up 
nothing in the way of confirmation.

The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican 
leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, ""The 
favorite sum of money is $1 billion  a billion a year for a fatter 
federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there."" [EMD Papers, 
Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the ""and pretty 
soon you're talking real money"" is missing.

In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted 
Dirksen: ""Look at education  two-and-one-half billion  a billion for 
this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five 
billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. 
You'll be deeply in the red."" [Cited in Byron Hulsey's ""Everett Dirksen 
and the Modern Presidents,"" Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of 
Texas, p. 226]

Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late 
Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not 
have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional 
Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and 
career  he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses 
claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches 
tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated 
newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, 
meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped 
capture.

Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have 
endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he 
ever coined it.

Hi there,

I recently delved into how the linux system clock and the hardware clock
interact with each other when I set up ntp on my system while connected
to the net. However, I didn't realise that Windows altered the hw clock
as there was no mention of it in any of the docs I read. 
I still dual-boot on a regular basis and if Windows is sneakily messing
with the clock, I'd be interested to know in what way it is and how it
couild be stopped from doing so. Everything seems to work fine since I
set the system up but I still don't like to have these gaps in my
knowledge.

Regards,
Anthony Geoghegan

A new census of the world's robot population reveals disturbing negative robot 
population growth, but still, our fleshless offspring's numbers point to a 
machinery future: 

    Some 20,000 domestic-help robots were sold worldwide last year, half 
    designed to mow lawns. Vacuum-cleaning robots were introduced late in 2001 
    and a study in Sweden found that 5,000 were sold in the last two months of 
    the year. Window-cleaning robots are set to boom, said the U.N. study.

I really wanted to go to this, especially to look at XOPUS. 
Unfortunately, we're launching a new intranet at work next week and I

This is the way forward, IMO.  Just wait a couple of years until
66 million Muslim Turks are making great strides towards democracy
and prosperity in the E.U. and Syria, Lebanon etc start lining up and
making similar decisions.

Of course there are hard-liners who would be right at home on
Rumsfeld's staff, but they got out-voted:

The aggregator has been pushed back on the priority list because more
important things cropped up. I can't give you an ETA on it, but it's
very much on the TODO list.

TO REMOVE YOURSELF SEND A BLANK E-MAIL TO:removal992002@yahoo.com

Hi,

You most likely have seen or heard about 
""The Letter"" $5.00 Paypal Program"" that has been seen lately 
on 20/20 and OPRAH WINFREY...etc... How would you like 
to generate more income through a different avenue? What 
if it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another 
program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. 
There 
is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!

THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW
THOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH 
YOU 
IS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!

Here's something which (I trust) will be of interest
to you! Please read all of this. This is not something 
that I would normally look at, except that I read an 
article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about 
PayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it 
would work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had
already experienced their efficiency and good standing. 
You can complete this whole process in one hour and you 
will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! 
Did I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the 
Internet-type fast.' Everything is done on the
Internet by E-mail.

NEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from
individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a 
little of their time.

TESTIMONIALS FROM:

Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:
Hey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of
our frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 
grand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run 
this program again........

Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC:
Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to
you... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said 
and went on vacation. When I got back, my account was 
up to over $12,000! I owe you!

GETTING STARTED.

If you're not already a user, the very first thing you
need to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes 
and PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this 
program FREE!

Here's the link:

https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com

BE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO 
$100 
DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!

Then...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) 
to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note
like ""Please add me to your mailing list."" BE PREPARED TO GET
EXCITED.... YOU 
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the 
others 
to start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No 
printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US 
Postal and 
Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, 
Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal 
Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a 
product or service must be exchanged for money received). 

Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this 
THREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much
faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY 
HIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see 
results in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT 
MONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 
or more as in other programs). Ideally, you should
send them to people who send their programs to you or to 
personal contacts who are already working on the web, 
because they know these programs work and they are already 
believers in the system! Besides, this program is 
MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already 
in 
another program, stay with it, but do
yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! 

It's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long 
before others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE 
person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET 
WHEN 
YOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have 
a 
PayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 
GIFT 
to
the person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list 
at No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow 
the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 
in your bank account!

Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT 
POTENTIAL, 
this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 
transaction that you get from PayPal!!!

Follow These Simple Instructions: 

E-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST 
name on the list (No.1) along with a note saying 
""subscribe me to your mailing list"". Only the first 
person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. 

Edit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the 
other 
two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first 
place 
in order to earn money fast! 
If you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-
mail to then your name will be immediately removed
from the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if 
you add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of 
people receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! 

NOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in 
the body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. 
Send out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.

ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the 
response 
time is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! 

Consider this! Millions of people surf the Internet
everyday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people 
to start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move 
the other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own 
e-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is 
associated 
with your PayPal account.

*************************************

There are fifty thousand new people who get on the
Internet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses 
is the people who send you offers by email.
The source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to
think of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I 
say 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's 
so easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!
To send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE
and paste it in the message of your E-mail. 

TO DO THIS:
1. Go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and ""select all""
2. Go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and select ""copy""
3. Start (compose) a new E-mail message (make sure
it's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!)
4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box
5. Go to ""edit"" and ""paste"" (Then you can format it
anyway you want!)


Now you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the
top name, adding your name and address to the bottom 
of the list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, 
YOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and the other 2 names move up. But DO NOT 
forget 
to send $5.00 via PayPal (along 
with your note) to the position #1 - TOP E-MAIL
address before deleting it!

NOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in
this e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal 
referring URL;


https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com


THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.
When your name reaches the first position in a few
days, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY!
The money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people
like yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to 
receive $20,000 in cash! That's all! There will be a 
total of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) 
in two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is 
real money that you can spend on anything you wish!
Just deposit it to your own bank account or spend it 
directly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that 
easy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?

GO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4
THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?

IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF
COURSE YOU CAN---

This plan is structured for everyone to send only 20
letters each. However, you are certainly not limited 
to 20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters 
you send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can 
E-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! 
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! Each time you run 
this 
program, just follow steps 1
through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! 
Simple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no 
mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the 
printer or copier, and you can do it again and again 
with your regular groups or gift givers, or start up 
a new group. Be SURE and PAY the first person on the

NEW PATENTED PRODUCT is designed to REPAIR SKIN DAMAGE & REJUVENATE TISSUE! 

Successfully addresses WRINKLES, DARK CIRCLES, AGE SPOTS, FINE LINES, LESIONS, SPIDER VEINS, SKIN TAGS, SCAR TISSUE, CELLULITE, STRETCH MARKS, and MORE for most people the LookGoodDuo is Hypoallergenic !

Research, which began many years ago, has concluded that ellagic acid, derived from a compound called ellagitannins, is a very powerful substance. The highest concentration of ellagitannins are found in raspberry seeds. The delivery of the ellagitannins, however, is the key to the effectiveness of the product. We use raspberry seed materials processed using a patented method, which is the ONLY method that guarantees the maximum delivery of available phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants. 

Ellagic acid from raspberry seed ellagitannins is the most powerful and complete polyphenolic, phytoestrogen, antioxidant material yet discovered! These plant based compounds, or phytoestrogens, when absorbed, provide many beneficial effects including stimulation of collagen formation. 

It is now known that the powerful agents in the raspberry seed materials tone the tiny blood vessels under the eye and decrease the release of the brown chemical pigment. The results are a decrease the appearance of the dark circles under the eyes. These materials also help to decrease the appearance of ""AGE"" brown spots, while smoothing WRINKLES, strengthening HAIR and NAILS, and supporting many other significant health issues! 

CELLULITE is simply FAT that is tethered down because certain cells in our skin are stimulated by estrogens. The phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants from both ORAL and TOPICAL sources of ellagic acid interfere with that tethering process resulting in a smoother skin surface. 

We offer this Patented material in both a tablet and a topical cream. Taken both internally and externally, it is easy to understand how they can achieve such obvious results so quickly, working from the inside-out AND from the outside-in.  Happy users report a healthy GLOW which they have never achieved with any other product! 


PRODUCT TESTIMONIALS 

I've been using the product for a little over a month. I took the ""2 face challenge', and I could tell a difference in only 3 days! The lines on my face and the pores had changed!  I have had people compliment my fingernails. They have been growing like crazy!  C.C., OH

This is a unique, one of a kind product.   I have been using it 3 weeks and I can truly see a difference in the liver spots on my hands. The prescription from my dermatologist didn't do it, but this product did.  M.F., MS

I have been watching myself very closely, and since using the product, the brown spots on my hand have just about disappeared. The smile lines and the eyelids have really tightened up. No more problems putting my eyeliner on! The skin under my chin has really tightened up.  This is not hard work, it is just sharing the product with family and friends. I have never been rewarded so quickly and so well.   E.P., CA

K.D., TX 

I was queen of skeptical.  I did not want to try this.  I am a 54 yr old grandmother.  I have tried everything for years to get rid of cellulite - the creams, the wraps - nothing worked.  My husband kept telling me to try this.  Finally I did it just to get him off my back.  I had not worn shorts for 5 years.  After about 10 days, my husband started telling me my legs were looking better.  I thought he was just being nice since he got me into this.   Then I went shopping, and in the lights in the dressing room, for the first time in a long time I looked pretty good.  I went into the next dressing room, because I thought the lights were wrong, but I still looked good.  I ended up buying shorts, and have been wearing shorts for the 1st time in 5 years.  Yes, it works!! G.C., TX

We just had a booth at the womens expo in Dallas.  Out of the 300 or 400 exhibitors there, the only other spot that had the people we did were the ones giving out free food.   V.C., TX

I did the 1 side of the face test, and I did not tell my spouse that I was doing it.  We went to get some  fast food.  He was looking at me, and said I can tell you which side you are using it on.  Its your right side.  I asked what made him think so, and he said the lines around my mouth and eyes have softened, and the fine lines around my neck.  We are tickled, because everyone we talk to wants it!  J.D., TX 

After using your product for less than a week, I ran into a friend who asked me what I was doing to look so YOUNG!  I have a full- time job, but I have made $8,000 since starting this business part time!   T.H.,Tx
---------------------------------------
I have found a system that works.  I have 44 people in my group in less than a month! In one month I made over $6,000!  B.M., NH
---------------------------------------------------------------
I am receiving 6 checks a month, and I do not even know where they are coming from!  W.T., TX
---------------------------------------------------------------
I have been in the company 3 weeks, and already have over 20 people in my group.  This is the easiest thing I have ever done.  All I do is tell them my story and give them the hotline number. ---------------------------------------------------------------
At a restaurant, I went to the restroom with a girlfriend and was telling her about what this product does.  We went back to the table, and in a few minutes 2 women walked up to me.  They said they were in the stalls and overheard us talking, and wanted some of the product.  I gave them a brochure, and noticed they went to 2 different tables.  They weren't even together!  J.M., TX

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last two
days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to the
upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to normal.
Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy, specially with

Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan 
Moore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. 
These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the 
public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but 
it's worth the wait. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)

but we use a real distribution (redhat), so if you were ok up to the
debian part, drop me a line.  it does involve windows, it will involve
it a lot.  the linux stuff will be minor, though as times go on that
might change.  the main part is corporate windows desktop support.

please mail me if you're interested?

After discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
""Hackers"" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 

    I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. ""The FBI wouldn't 
    waste resources on that,"" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. Becauseand this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumblingwhen you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygenand arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

========================================================
Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:

To whom it may concern,

I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70s & 80s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?

Sincerely,

RJ

Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.

Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!
(In many instances most, if not all, traumas and distress can be eliminated!)

1984! in San Fransisco is hardly enough to extrapolate 500 to 3k.

This is the only quote I could find relating to promiscuity in
homosexual men.

""I think people feel a certain invulnerability, especially young
people, like this disease doesn't affect me. The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, ""That isn't me. I'm not promiscuous."" Promiscuity, especially, was a piece where people could easily say, ""Well, I'm not. Promiscuous is more than I do."" If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me.""

You could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume.  BFD.
This kind of random generation of numbers that leads the nutty
religious bigots (as you mentioned earlier).

Grr.   Bits damnit.  Now, I must go brief.

mention bazillion bug fixes.

The full [1]announcement is available, and you can read [2]what is new in

Since this release has extensive support for non-Latin scripts, we also
translated the announcement to [4]Traditional Chinese (Big5-ETEN),
[5]Simplified Chinese (EUC-CN or GB2312), [6]Japanese (EUC-JP), and
[7]Korean (EUC-KR) (by Autrijus Tang, Dan Kogai, and Jungshik Shin).

Think of all the people and places that would not get unsolicited mail

I think it's like P3P met whatever commercial /.like forum was rocking
yesterday, and they took all Greg's extra serotonin and lit up and
made a Successful go of personal address palettes you could occupy and
own or rent and even move or sell.  So you'd reply to all the whitepaper
sites you wouldn't just call to get the real deal like: 'Okay, let's say
I'm in Factorytown, GuangZhou, and I'm a battery acid supervisor for
a multinational that sometimes buys B1s.  e-mail me if you get your story
written up all the way;' or

This is in fact very true.  People hate doing this for several reasons in my experience: 1) ""Software changes.   Why waste time writing a FAQ now that will be out of date at the next release in 3 months?"" 2) ""This knowledge is specialized.  Only 4 people need to know this, and they already do.  If anyone else needs to know it they know who they can call."" The same engineers who give these excuses will spend eternities on the phone discussing this arcana and sharing the knowledge with anyone who has the patience to ask. The strongest contributors freely share everything they know whenever asked (or whenever they see the need for the information in the company) and who at the same time continue to generate new knowledge. Personal evaluation: my worth comes slightly lower on the scale in that I synthesize the knowledge from various personal sharing exercises into usable documents and messages for the company to employ.  This would seem like a marketing exercise except that Marketing is useless.   Useful knowledge sharing comes (IMHO) from engineering and sales. 	JTS http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,1

**Is your PC acting a bit sluggish?**  
Does is sometimes choke on large graphics files or spend more time than ever
spinning its hard drive?

Adding more RAM to your system may be the perfect answer to your computing
woes. With more RAM, you'll be able to get more out of your favorite games,
graphics applications, and other resource-intensive applications.

Unfortunately, figuring out what type of RAM to buy can be both difficult and
frustrating.

Luckily, CNET's all-in-one **Memory Configurator** makes finding the perfect
memory easier than ever! Whatever type of system you have, your just a few
clicks away from the upgrade you'll need to get your system living up to its
full potential.

"""Fox"" <lds0062@cdc.net>",<razor-users@example.sourceforge.net>,"Fri, 13 Sep 2002 10:26:09 -0400",[Razor-users] Fun Uses of Razored Mail,"I'm taking all my razored mail today and calling any 1-800 numbers I can
find.  I say ""Hi, I'm calling everyone that spammed me today to raise their
cost of doing business.  You have a great day!""  I'm told I should do it
from a pay phone, so it costs them 50 cents per call.  If more people did
this, we could tie up their phone lines and cost them so much money they
could never make spam work.

Also fun is the simple ""Die Spammer Die!""

[AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET developer, and so who do you think needs this book? [CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers. [PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work with when writing the book. [AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.

There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related topics. What is free threading?  Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should end, and what it should do while executing.

This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM  http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid026 The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an existing C# or VB.NET project. ***Get on the Fast Track to Success If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core .NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for you. The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by providing concise guides to core topics.

That's on a week like this that you realize that lots of porters are
European (and managed to free themselves for YAPC::Europe.) Or were they,
on the contrary, too busy in the big blue room ? On the other hand, the
number of bug reports stayed at its habitual average level.

shorter. Over the last month or so, I've been making strenuous efforts to
contact all of the groups we had listed to see which ones were still
active. What you see is the result of this exercise. Almost half of the
groups have been removed because they haven't responded to my emails.

If your local group still exists but is no longer listed, then that means
that I don't have an update to date contact for your group. Please [3]let
me know if that's the case.""

Date: Not supplied

I've been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas 
about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he 
blogged the hell out of the talk: 

    Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano 
    roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), 
    ""the Betamax affair""... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax 
    case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would 
    not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the 
    VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the 
    case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a 
    technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. 
    This principle is under attack. 

    Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright 
    measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits 
    distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content 
    scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, 
    override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial 
    for creating a piece of code.

BANK,New York.You can do your independent verification of this. However,
by virtue of our  position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we

**Greetings from Download.com!**

If you're developing Windows applications in an ActiveX-compatible environment
(which includes most major ones such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you
started taking advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com every day. This
week, we've collected the top programs that handle transparent GIF files,
offer prebuilt ActiveX controls, and edit hex code to get you up and running.

Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries: FileSystem 1.2
and AppSecureX 2.9. FileSystem gives you access to drives, folders, and I/O
operations; and AppSecureX adds serial number and shareware-type functionality
to your applications.

in ActiveX  
**FileSystem 1.2**  
Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The FileSystem ActiveX
control offers complete access to common file information under Windows
through three independent interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access
to file I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code. Use this
control's interfaces to detect media types and media insertion, get complete
lists of folders and files at unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes
are set on files, and even load logbook files into collections automatically.
Rope in your files.

**ApSecureX 2.9**  
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX. This control
provides a registration system that produces a valid serial number customized
to the user's machine. When the user installs your software, a unique ID
number is generated for that system. To get the serial number, the user must
provide you with his installation number. The data file created by the
application is encrypted differently for each system, so even if someone were
to crack the file, they couldn't use the information on another machine.
AppSecure can also give your software shareware functionality such as number
of days left, checking to see if the system clock is set back, and so on.
AppSecureX works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo application is
included. Lock up your software.

in Java  
**AppletFile 2.5**  
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your Web site's file
upload and download capabilities. In addition to support for SSL, proxy, and
authenticated uploading, users can upload and download multiple files using
predefined paths to automate the process as much as possible. A scripting
language provides for sophisticated customization, and the user interface
includes support for 12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC feature downloads only
updated files, and verification of file transfer integrity is made possible
with built-in support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on HTTP
protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds Sun's Java Plug-in
support for Netscape 6+ browsers and shows removable media drives in the
browse dialog. Beam up your files.

in Tools & Editors  
**PHP Master Editor 2.0**  
Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this tool. PHP Master
Editor includes an internal browser for viewing, as well as a debugger for
local testing. Basic FTP capability is also included. Specifically designed
for PHP programmers, the program recognizes and formats functions, variables,
and classes within the code, and features customizable code templates. Get
code-happy.

Hmmm... installed SA 2.40, but I get the same error when trying

the amavis code is calling for this.  I'll hit up the

No offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a
sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.

My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more
to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth.  (Which is the
gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't
the most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it
was.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to
the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the
people doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don't
support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin
Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think that
this is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a
right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the
folks they elected in the first place.

My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases
such as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts
we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He
has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the
representatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.

I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original
thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming
dissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in
having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the
policy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the
screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from
the folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,
offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply
due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'My
generation never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story,
we just dont' know it all.

I hope this clarifies my position.   For the quick rehash:

Screaming != Free speech on all cases.
Dissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by
the Supremes.

K?

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion!

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 


 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 

Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS

   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like

So what brilliant metric do you have in mind to measure unsolicited vs.
solicited commercial email?

I know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that
really reads like spam.  Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent
SA if they make spam look like this SCE.  This kind of convergence of the
two.... well, it stinks.  We can kill SCE, or we can cripple
identification of UCE.

Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably
harder.  What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc
is in the corpus for the GA?  Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set
of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.

Every new Mac comes with an upgrade 10.2 CD as of last week.
So if you bought one on the 12th, you'd be running 10.2 before the release
this Friday night.

>Unless someone is selling some pomme kit for cheapish/swap?

Good luck with that, even Mac geeks have a longer upgrade cycle than the
average PC user, but you'd never know...

Gregory Alan Bolcer <gbolcer@endeavors.com>,FoRK <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>,"Mon, 26 Aug 2002 07:25:30 -0700",Enlightenment,"I finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window manager
and evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 years
of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point
at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to
another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I
had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 
desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along
with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],
I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  

After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am
really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills
first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]
but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,
(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The
number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After
less than an hour or two of ""nesting"" I already have almost
all my menus and controls setup just the way I want. 

I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It's
a great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite the
bullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine.

(Product descriptions, pricing and deep-discounted Intro Offers information below.)

SEVENTH HEAVEN ""SWEET TREAT"" MENU

**Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**
********************************

""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.

Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)

This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!

We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.

Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!

* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!

* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy.

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************

High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.

Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) 

Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.

**CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm)**
***************************

A Sedate Smoking or Brewing Happiness Botanical.

Capillaris Loose-leaf Herba is a very calming, happy sort of smoking/brewing herba. Capillaris Herba is a singular botanical and is best utilized close to bedtime as it is a very sedate herba. Not as potent as Shangrila Zowie Wowie from a smoking perspective (no legal product is), but well worth your attention! Many folks find that if they partake of both smoke and brew that not only do they go to sleep very happily, but that their dreaming life is often nicely enhanced.

Capillaris Herba botanical is best rolled or bowled when engaged as a ""Smoka."" As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage Capillaris Herba as a most peaceful brew/tea. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Capillaris Herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) 

Capillaris Herba is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Capillaris Herba is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Capillaris Herba not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time.

Even then, those relics were well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.   Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than $200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.   Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.

<cali@coinet.com>,<webmaster@efi.ie>,"Tue, 04 Jun 0102 23:35:33 -0800",I could be JAILED for selling this CD!,"Dear fellow eBay user,

I listed this CD on eBay a few months ago and here's 
what happened.  I got an email from Safeharbor saying 
that all my auctions had been cancelled and that the CD 
was permanently ""banned"" from being sold on eBay.  From 
then on, I called it the ""Banned CD""!

So why did eBay ban it?  Maybe they figured you shouldn't 
have access to this type of information, or maybe they 
didn't think we could cram all of these programs onto 
one CD Rom.  I'll let you decide.

This CD will teach you things that eBay, Uncle Sam, and 
others just don't want you to know.  I am not responsible 
for how you use some of this information and it is 
provided for educational purposes only.  Here are just a 
few of the things you will learn ...

*** Find confidential info on anyone in 30 minutes or 
less on the Internet.  

    You'll be able to track down your old flame, find 
    out how much money your ex is hiding in their bank 
    account, or run a background check on proespective 
    client or employee.  Even government agencies have 
    trouble obtaining much of this information.  You 
    will have all the resources of any professional 
    investigator right at your fingertips - on your 
    home computer!

*** List of companies who will issue you a college 
    degree (including a Phd.) for a fee.  No study 
    required!

*** Learn how to get FREE cable and DSS channels, 
    including the adult stations and Pay-Per-View!
 
*** List of suppliers of ""questionable"" items, such as 
    fcc banned communications devices, scanners, night 
    vision goggles, passports, fake identification, and 
    everything else that you won't find in the back of 
    Soldier of Fortune magazine!

*** Find products to resell on the Internet with our 
    Wholesale Directory containing over 1 million 
    (that's right, one million!) wholesale sources for 
    computers, electronics, beanies, trend items, 
    jewelry, cars, collectibles, and everything else!  

*** Over 25 million email addresses, fresh and targeted!
    You can use these to contact the people and send 
    them your advertisements.

*** Find out how to get a completely new identity.  
    Disappear without a trace!

*** Find out how to ERASE bad credit and even create a 
    whole new file in the credit bureau computers.

*** Learn how to beat the IRS. Tax tips for the rest of
    us.

*** Complete guide on how to claim public land offered 
    by the Government. You can find your dream home for
    a ridiculously low price or buy properties to resell
    for a huge profit! 

*** Accept checks from your customers by fax, phone and
    email with the full working version of Checker 
    Software included!

*** Business software to help you run your small business, 
    including label maker software, money management software, 
    IRS forgiveness program, database software, and much more.

*** A huge collection of screensavers, graphics, clipart, 
    and desktop themes to spice up your computer.

*** MUCH, MUCH MORE that we don't have room to list!

Ask yourself this question: where else will you find such
a HUGE collection of information and software on one CD? 
And who else would dare sell you a CD containing so much 
""contraband"" info?  It was banned on eBay, has been 
prohibited in THIRTY THREE countries, and will soon be 
unavailable in the USA. If you wait more than a few days
to order this CD, I can't guarantee I will be able to 
sell it.  Get this CD *** NOW *** before it is banned forever!

http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html

""Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run
on the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be
run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.
Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field
started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI
and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to
go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the
client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one
important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is
loaded, as JavaScript functions do.

And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access
XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their
browser.""

===
""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a
new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured
out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and
billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of
servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai
does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default
""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house
applications.""

""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the
Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is
more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth
connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several
cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles
these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that
the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this
digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header
for the file.""",0,1

**Here's YOUR Chance To Join The Online Selling Revolution And EARN A FULL
TIME INCOME!**

**Our eBay Marketing e-Course will show you how to create HUGE profits selling
on eBay!**  
  
---|---  
  
* * *

Do you sell on eBay? If so, you could be making up to $100,000 per month.  
  
This is no hype and no scam. Receiving over 1.5 billion page views per month,
eBay is the ULTIMATE venue for selling virtually anything and making huge
profits with almost no effort. But you have to know what to sell and how to
sell. That's where I come in.  
  
As a leading expert in internet marketing and the owner of several profitable
auction-based businesses, the manual that I have written provides easy to
understand and detailed instructions for maximizing your profits with selling
strategies that are PROVEN WINNERS.  
  
If you've read any other books on eBay, you know that all of them are designed
for the computer idiot and the auction novice. They tell you how to register,
how to list an item, how to avoid fraud, etc. This is not the information you
need to make millions on eBay. You need to learn effective SELLING STRATEGIES
not read a photocopy of eBay help files! My manual assumes that you already
know your way around eBay; you don't need any specialized computer knowledge,
but you should be familiar with buying and selling on eBay auctions. I'm not
going to waste your time teaching you how to register - I'm going to pass on
the SECRET SELLING TECHNIQUES that I use each and every day to bring in
hundreds of thousands of dollars selling my products on internet auctions. The
manual comes as a complete course with the following lessons:

**Make a Fortune on eBay**  
Make a Fortune on eBay is filled with page after page of vital eBay marketing
information. This valuable e-Book is terrific for the eBay user to get the
right eBay information and have an instant edge over other more experienced
eBay Sellers

**Advanced Selling on eBay**  
Advanced Selling on eBay has more vital information to make their auction a
success. This e-Book has many topics to ensure that they get the maximum
potential from their auctions.Advanced Selling on eBay goes into more detailed
information than it's sister e-Book Make a Fortune on eBay.

**16 eBay Forms  
**""16 eBay Forms"" is a must. These forms will help them track, analyze and
record their auctions. It contains 16 forms with full instructions. This
E-Book also contains the forms in printer friendly version, so they can print
them for immediate use.

**Wholesale Sources  
**Wholesale Sources is the final e-Book in the eBay Marketing e-Course. It
contains wholesale distributors from the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Asia and the Philippines. Armed with this e-Book your customers will
have over 10,000,000 wholesale products at their finger tips..

This manual is designed for individuals looking to form an online business for
extra income or as a full-time job making hundreds of thousands of dollars on
eBay. Contained in the manual are WINNING STRATEGIES for selling on eBay
auctions. The manual is not designed for eBay novices and does not teach the
""basics"" such as registering, putting an item online, buying an item, etc.
This manual is designed to make eBay users into successful and wealthy
entrepreneurs!  
  

Not only will you be able to make THOUSANDS with the information in these
e-Books, you will also receive FULL Resellers rights. This is not an affiliate

The problem is that Python has a much longer startup time than Perl 
(though this may have changed recently, I don't know). This is partly 
why Python was never very popular for CGIs.

the USA at 59% (since 2000!), Denmark flatlines at 60%, Norway at 54%,

The actual follow-up to the Xing player break was more interesting than
that.  The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and
output) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly
designed systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy for
CSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to break
with exhaustive search attacks.  It was only 40-bits (speculated)
because of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export
rules at the time.

Even more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xing
player break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself.  They
rapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithm
with an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacks
might have further reduced the strength).  This is another great example
showing why proprietary cryptography algorithms should be viewed with
the greatest of suspicion.

Yes and no.  You can put a limited amount of trust in a smart card.
There have been any number of very clever attacks against smartcards
(Ross Anderson in the UK has documented quite a few of these), and
smartcard manufactures are usually one step behind these attacks.  A
well designed system assumes that a system smartcard will be completely
compromised at some point, giving an adversary all of the secrets
contained in the smartcard.  The cryptography industry has developed a
variety of techniques that can reduce the impact of a compromise,
including unique keys per smartcard and forward security techniques.

Going back to the original question, once the encrypted material goes
outside the trusted hardware, it is impossible to ""unbreakably"" protect
it.  There may be some mitigation steps you can take, such as the SDMI
watermarking, but most schemes to date have been easily broken.  

Another consideration is the value of what you are trying to protect.
While there is no such thing as unbreakable, adding more cost (both in
terms of price and hassle-factor) can greatly improve the protection.
Since you are talking about the use of standard PC workstations, I
presume what you are trying to protect is not THAT valuable.  I'm afraid
most security measures don't come for free.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"",  meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same  time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one  version available. 'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it... --  	- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list",0,1

This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits. Description: The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger race in the dcache of the file system subsystem. This kernel update addresses both of these issues. In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following drivers: stradis rio500 se401 usbvideo apm Finally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had the capability to expose kernel memory when abused. All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the time of this writing, have any known exploits. We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar Designer, and others for their auditing work.

>>From the website:
""Spackle is designed to be a flexible client/server architecture for the 
gathering and displaying of statistics, primarily suited to monitoring 
servers. It's written in PHP and bash shell script, uses RRDtool  for stats 
logging, and PostgreSQL for the server-side database. (soon to support MySQL 
as well)""

I had this up and running within a few hours. The hardest bit was getting 
PostgreSQL running as it's been a few years since I used it. I had a bit of a 
problem getting it to work on rh6.2 boxes but I documented the changes here: 
http://xeer.blogspot.com/?/2002_07_01_xeer_archive.html#79148596

Web interface is simple, but functional. It has a simple way of distributing 
the monitoring scripts (which could be compromised but I digress), and the 
resulting graphs are pretty!

Eh?  AFAIK, the Russian Kholod program achieved successful supersonic

But that obscures the different modes of promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense of the word. But their motives and behavior are quite different. Langur monkeys were the example in the cited article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But cozying up to the current dominant male isn't the best strategy for female langurs, because ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide,"" by the male who is likely next to rule the roost. Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a better picture of that. ;-) _________________________________________________________________ Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com",0,1

September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.
The Wages of September 11
There is no going back.



September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a
superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply
because the sun still rises and sets.

This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing
into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real
time by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,
which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers
dealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the
manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and
centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,
they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing
has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.

Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally
repugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By
lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the
vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and
bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only
ghoulish not fearsome.

The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found
them both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate
them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite
another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily
dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good
theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British
commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and
an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of
the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,
but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,
the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist
paradise on earth.

Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with
Europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic
nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters 
a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold
War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has
insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an
antidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power
is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often
dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally
exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the
moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed
the problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent:
pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract
moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and
constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire
while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with
only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more
sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European
hobbits after September 11.

America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile
Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti
means nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more
friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.
Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of
their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a
pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn
that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is
just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come
from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan
offer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governments
that hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal
family, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which
has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic
reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic
governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as
Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.

The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the
military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chicken
hawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings
hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness
against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery
ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.
More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those
soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30
years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of
Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no
generation of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand
brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in
sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American
soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security
is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in
lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the
Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.

Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than
rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad
as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at
home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into
harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect
thousands in high-rises.

Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical
conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes
repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe
to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose
belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were
so often at loggerheads with nave and idealist leftists.

No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet
Communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions
of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise
open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,
even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in
the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if
multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western
construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim
nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the
Left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and
idealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president
astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.

All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the
subsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we
will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.",0,1

NTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking 
medium: 

    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals 
    through people, with human bodies as communications circuits, the paper 
    said, citing sources close to the companies. 

    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical 
    connection to a PDA that can remain in one's pocket, the paper said. 

    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers 
    while shaking hands, with the data automatically written into both their 
    PDAs, the paper said.

Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head
only reads the first n lines.

Who's the real monster?


It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.

Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.

Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.

The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?

Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.

Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand


It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.

What Dave does is just the opposite.

Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.

One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  ""It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.""

Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.

We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.

If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it
along to zaphod@egroups.com

Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...


The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.

Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:

His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.

In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot...""

The zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar
tale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?


It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.

Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!

The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!

Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!

Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?

Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

something really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe
9-11.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark ""RSS""


Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.

So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:

http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336

This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.

Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!

Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:

Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them.

The ears of sweet corn are just starting to show up on local farm stands, inaugurating one of the ceremonies of an American summer. These days the nation's nearly 80 million-acre field of corn rolls across the countryside like a second great lawn, but this wholesome, all-American image obscures a decidedly more dubious reality. Like the tulip, the apple and the potato, zea mays (the botanical name for both sweet and feed corn) has evolved with humans over the past 10,000 years or so in the great dance of species we call domestication. The plant gratifies human needs, in exchange for which humans expand the plant's habitat, moving its genes all over the world and remaking the land (clearing trees, plowing the ground, protecting it from its enemies) so it might thrive. Corn, by making itself tasty and nutritious, got itself noticed by Christopher Columbus, who helped expand its range from the New World to Europe and beyond. Today corn is the world's most widely planted cereal crop. But nowhere have humans done quite as much to advance the interests of this plant as in North America, where zea mays has insinuated itself into our landscape, our food system and our federal budget. One need look no further than the $190 billion farm bill President Bush signed last month to wonder whose interests are really being served here. Under the 10-year program, taxpayers will pay farmers $4 billion a year to grow ever more corn, this despite the fact that we struggle to get rid of the surplus the plant already produces. The average bushel of corn (56 pounds) sells for about $2 today; it costs farmers more than $3 to grow it. But rather than design a program that would encourage farmers to plant less corn which would have the benefit of lifting the price farmers receive for it Congress has decided instead to subsidize corn by the bushel, thereby insuring that zea mays dominion over its 125,000-square mile American habitat will go unchallenged. At first blush this subsidy might look like a handout for farmers, but really it's a form of welfare for the plant itself -- and for all those economic interests that profit from its overproduction: the processors, factory farms, and the soft drink and snack makers that rely on cheap corn. For zea mays has triumphed by making itself indispensable not to farmers (whom it is swiftly and surely bankrupting) but to the Archer Daniels Midlands, Tysons and Coca-Colas of the world. Our entire food supply has undergone a process of ""cornification"" in recent years, without our even noticing it. That's because, unlike in Mexico, where a corn-based diet has been the norm for centuries, in the United States most of the corn we consume is invisible, having been heavily processed or passed through food animals before it reaches us. Most of the animals we eat (chickens, pigs and cows) today subsist on a diet of corn, regardless of whether it is good for them. In the case of beef cattle, which evolved to eat grass, a corn diet wreaks havoc on their digestive system, making it necessary to feed them antibiotics to stave off illness and infection. Even farm-raised salmon are being bred to tolerate corn  not a food their evolution has prepared them for. Why feed fish corn? Because it's the cheapest thing you can feed any animal, thanks to federal subsidies. But even with more than half of the 10 billion bushels of corn produced annually being fed to animals, there is plenty left over. So companies like A.D.M., Cargill and ConAgra have figured ingenious new ways to dispose of it, turning it into everything from ethanol to Vitamin C and biodegradable plastics. By far the best strategy for keeping zea mays in business has been the development of high-fructose corn syrup, which has all but pushed sugar aside. Since the 1980's, most soft drink manufacturers have switched from sugar to corn sweeteners, as have most snack makers. Nearly 10 percent of the calories Americans consume now come from corn sweeteners; the figure is 20 percent for many children. Add to that all the corn-based animal protein (corn-fed beef, chicken and pork) and the corn qua corn (chips, muffins, sweet corn) and you have a plant that has become one of nature's greatest success stories, by turning us (along with several other equally unwitting species) into an expanding race of corn eaters. So why begrudge corn its phenomenal success? Isn't this the way domestication is supposed to work? The problem in corn's case is that we're sacrificing the health of both our bodies and the environment by growing and eating so much of it. Though we're only beginning to understand what our cornified food system is doing to our health, there's cause for concern. It's probably no coincidence that the wholesale switch to corn sweeteners in the 1980's marks the beginning of the epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in this country. Sweetness became so cheap that soft drink makers, rather than lower their prices, super-sized their serving portions and marketing budgets. Thousands of new sweetened snack foods hit the market, and the amount of fructose in our diets soared. This would be bad enough for the American waistline, but there's also preliminary research suggesting that high-fructose corn syrup is metabolized differently than other sugars, making it potentially more harmful. A recent study at the University of Minnesota found that a diet high in fructose (as compared to glucose) elevates triglyceride levels in men shortly after eating, a phenomenon that has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and heart disease. Little is known about the health effects of eating animals that have themselves eaten so much corn, but in the case of cattle, researchers have found that corn-fed beef is higher in saturated fats than grass-fed beef. We know a lot more about what 80 million acres of corn is doing to the health of our environment: serious and lasting damage. Modern corn hybrids are the greediest of plants, demanding more nitrogen fertilizer than any other crop. Corn requires more pesticide than any other food crop. Runoff from these chemicals finds its way into the groundwater and, in the Midwestern corn belt, into the Mississippi River, which carries it to the Gulf of Mexico, where it has already killed off marine life in a 12,000 square mile area. To produce the chemicals we apply to our cornfields takes vast amounts of oil and natural gas. (Nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas, pesticides from oil.) America's corn crop might look like a sustainable, solar-powered system for producing food, but it is actually a huge, inefficient, polluting machine that guzzles fossil fuel -- a half a gallon of it for every bushel. So it seems corn has indeed become king. We have given it more of our land than any other plant, an area more than twice the size of New York State. To keep it well fed and safe from predators we douse it with chemicals that poison our water and deepen our dependence on foreign oil. And then in order to dispose of all the corn this cracked system has produced, we eat it as fast as we can in as many ways as we can turning the fat of the land into, well, fat. One has to wonder whether corn hasn't at last succeeded in domesticating us. ====== Michael Pollan is the author, most recently, of ""The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World."" http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,1

what about using a pcmcia card and a compaq flash card?  or doing an
nfs boot to a server in a noiser part of the house?  (the boiler room

SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec 
dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.

That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
$1-20 range (depending on the application).

As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.

Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing--I didn't realize I was incurring administrative pickle bloat this way.  I'm specifically trying to make things faster and smaller, so I'm storing individual WordInfo pickles into an anydbm dict (keyed by token).  The result is that it's almost 50 times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail (.408s vs 18.851s). However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this project isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implementation, so I guess I'll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts to point more in that direction.  .4 seconds is probably fast enough for people to use it in their procmailrc, which is what I was after. > If you're desparate to save memory, write a subclass?

I have one more question though.  I downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight? ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/ local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url That worked fine so I moved to the next step. make At the bottem of the text I got the following messages: Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp' make: *** [w3] Error 2 When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are the commands I used. ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url followed by the commands make and make install. There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.

But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g.
Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are
fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you
still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be
alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best
which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
drives become cheaper.

Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term
significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static
application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large
client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because
these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different
sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also
tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular
with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence
services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a
physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application
server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I
use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable
because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap
space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)

My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID
device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image
partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but
solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of
base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the
server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then
market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that
rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer
overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized
modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this
particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend
application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself
has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could
help.

I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a
hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no
knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a
product, I'd love to hear about it.

  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex,=20
Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy.=20
=20
Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the=20
UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the=20
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer =
-=20
known locally as The English Season.=20

Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our=20
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these=
=20
events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport.=
=20


  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication=20
tool?

Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the=
=20
brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where=20
the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We=20
believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?

We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of=20
the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and=20
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and=20
development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to=20
make The Season central to our marketing mix.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?

We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our=20
mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the=
=20
frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and=20
the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever=20
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.

We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions=20
related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office wil=
l=20
like to be involved in such a decision.=20


  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?

Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment=20
decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events.=20
This is our rule and frame of investment.


  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?

Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-=E0=
-
vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press,=20
magazine of all kinds).=20

Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that=20
complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of=
=20
similar status, but differing interests.=20


  Please describe one of your sponsorships

The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdra=
y=20
Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by=
=20
Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve=20
Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target=20
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the=
=20
king of sports.


  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?

Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large=20
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we=20
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve=20
Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are=20
getting a good return on our investment.


  How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?

It sounds like the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff rather than hardware.

Unusual -  8 n 1 is more common.

I think that the AT command for hardware flow control is &E4 though this
may vary from modem to modem.

Date: Not supplied

Teresa's written a wonderful blog post about the revelation that Tyco's crooked 
CEO spent ""6,000 on a shower curtain, $15,000 for an umbrella stand, $2,900 on 
coat hangers, $5,960 on bedsheets and $2,200 for a wastebasket."" 

    Naturally, they assured her that not only is it possible to pay $6,000 for 
    your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do 
    so, practically essential. Then they explain how: 

    ""Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed,"" said Joel Joves, a designer with 
    offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. ""If you have a fabulous study 
    or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with 
    decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a 
    room."" 

    That's Fool Money at work. If you can't find a sufficiently fabulous 
    wastebasket for $200, $500 absolute tops, you're not half trying.

It may be a conspiracy against spell checkers. I noticed the Spell icon

    because we haven't published the details.

    In the end, given that you don't know much about TeS or how it

The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the  major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.) Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce competition from discounters, a too-small area of service concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was too small to survive on  its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal. Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one creditor was named in any account we could find. Yet before we soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word from the folks getting stiffed.) Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability"" thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas  Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and pocketed 11 times its investment. Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner, United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal,  there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel US Airways Files for Chapter 11 http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Business/ap20020811_1301.html US Airways Announces Bankruptcy http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/business/12AIR.html Shifts to Cause Rerouting of Some Booked Fliers http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/business/12CONS.html US Airways Files for Bankruptcy Protection http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6587-2002Aug11.html US Airways Group, Hit Hard By Terror, Files for Chapter 11 http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1029103594827437995,00.html (Paid subscription required.) ----------------------------------------------------------------- ADVERTISEMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------- You've heard about identity management, but do you know about the opportunities and business models that will emerge as a result?

Once stories fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to  recall the fuss over chads. The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be  holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because  the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention, especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed  for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million -- and that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more.  Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the  regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two  investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,"" the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for  the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend  its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service.  But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is simply buying low so it can sell higher.  Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock, as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah Asbrand Hobbled Global Crossing Accepts Buyout Bid From Asian Investors http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1028898681279625080,00.html (Paid subscription required.)

Barbie has been made over as a Bond girl:  

    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/bondbarbie.jpg] As James Bond, Ken 
    has matured nicely with rooted hair, with slight silvering at his temples, 
    wearing a midnight blue tuxedo, and authentic recreation of the classic tux 
    by Brioni, the famed clothier. Linda Hemming, the award winning costume 
    designer in charge of this year's James Bond film, outfits Barbie doll. She 
    wears a blood red gown with a glittering gold lace overlay and a gauzy red 
    shawl with a gold filigree design. Her gown is cut up the side to reveal 
    lots of leg as well as not so discreet hip strap that anchors Barbie's cell 
    phone. The set is slated for release in November, to coincide with the 
    premiere of ""Die Another Day,"" the new James Bond film. Bond, James Bond, 
    meet Barbie, just Barbie...

NbbvxDR4V@sympatico.ca,Awesome@Awesome.com,28 Jun 01 10:05:15 PM,Real Money Maker for Real!,"Dear Friends & Future Millionaire: 

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: 
Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for 
an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time 
THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 

================================================== 

BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! 

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you 
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of 
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted 
an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see 
if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or 
not the program was legal. 

Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws 
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the 
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF 
POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, 
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 

This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I 
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 

=================================================== 

Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long 
time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again 
in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple 
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. 
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made 
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first, 

===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and 
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: 

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== 

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 

=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from 
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be 
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in 
case something happen to your computer. 

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is 
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority 
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see 
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been 
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their 
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But 
it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and 
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person 
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 

========================================================== 

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with 
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide 
you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk 
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. 
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 

==========================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will 
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's 
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% 
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded 
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 
e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and 
ordered Report # 2
. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails 
sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report 
# 5
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 
... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT 
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !
 
========================================================= 

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are 
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, 
many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 

======================================================= 

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds 
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will 
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 
and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you 
must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
receivethe report. 

=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== 

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: 
Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT 
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets 
of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME 
of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name 
and postal address.

============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ 

""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. 
When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored 
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I 
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on 
her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks 
she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received 
total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody 
in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 

====================================================== 

''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with 
orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about 
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a 
better investment with a faster return and so big."" 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 

======================================================= 

''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered 
if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not 
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
money came within 22 weeks."" 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 

======================================================= 

''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was 
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."".

I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding     J> some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but     J> I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing     J> or not. I've seen data that shows 1200 rocks (TV-set sized and smaller) crashing into the Ottawa skies /every/ /single/ /night/, and that's just the background noise.  Plots of that data show us passing through hundreds of 'tubes' of debris, each indicative of some other larger something out there, only a small handful of which have been discovered.  This is without even considering the one's headed this way out of the Oort for their First Big Trip. One thing you will just have to get used to is hearing news of a possible collision; we have only started funding the projects to look for these things since Hollywood took an interest with Armageddon, and we have only just recently turned on a bunch of new toys to do automated sky surveys.  There are also some new (and very clever) amateur projects co-ordinating multiple telescopes to detect these criters, one of which plans to network dozens of ground based machines around the world.  You may remember a few years back the 2028 doomsday story -- consider them good ghost stories, then go back to work. 20,000 years ago, one of them the size of Mt Everest just ever so slightly grazed us and left a scar 400km long in the side of South America before it scooted out into space.  First nations people would have been there then, and it would have seriously ruined their day. Orbital elements tell us that our modern technology would have perhaps given us 90-min advance warning.    The near-miss earlier this month wasn't seen until it was already past us; we can't detect rocks on their trip behind the Sun, and when they come out slingshot to relativistic speeds, well, it's just too darn late to do much of anything about it.  On the inbound trip, even at their max full-moon angle, these things are most often magnitude 16 or way worse, which is many magnitudes fainter than what you see in the deepest dark-skies; no one thought to paint them shiny and white. They day before it ""hits"" my software says NT7 will be magnitude 14 -- it's easier to see the space station. What's worse, the Sun is not a smooth hard spheric marble, it's a twisted gelatinous hunk o' hunk o' burnin' love, so the precise warp curve of space right near it's backside is (ahem) somewhat problematic to compute precisely.  It's also spewing considerable plasma flux in all directions, and then there's all these other big gelatinous roaming globs (Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune) and some significant roaming rubble (us), and damn it, they are all spinning too, and most of them have a magnetosphere! Shit. Forget it. Learn to play the banjo. Take peppermint Rye-Kee Shee-At-Zoo relaxation therapy and oodles of Ag-nasial I&I-drop suppliments, eat no kind of frozen portion, and floss.  Good planets are real hard to find, so enjoy the one you got while it's here.  Call your ma. Do an anonymous kindness for your better half, another for a total stranger. Having all the best toys is useless when they all spontaneously combust from a global Wormwood shockwave. You should be diggin' it while it's happenin' Like, just live your life like there's no tomorrow, ok?  Don't bank on being able to redeem yourself later. Yeah, sure, Osama could whack you with some nail-coated fuel-air bombs, heck a mis-informed TopGun could do it too, but the Good Lord could do it too, with pure, clean and galactically EnviroFriendly kinetic energy, and He don't stand in line for no Airport Security Check. Hell, fire and brimstone are classically given in the reverse order; best to be on the impact side of the planet. Learn to stop worrying and love the Rock.  Besides, the rats and cockroaches will survive, and they already know how to kickstart evolution right back into Enrons, WorldComs and Calcuttas.  They even have all our wiring and plumbing diagrams and half of our socks. Are we going to get hit?  Yup.   When?  Every 65 million years and, oh my lord, will you /look/ at the time! Where/what/when? Space is pretty big.  Take the largest thing you can imagine, double it, and add 10%: That is just the local pancake region between us and the Sun. There's the whole rest of the disk of the ecliptic and, which is where the NT7 observation came from, it has only recently occurred to the meteor hunters to ""look up"" (or down); almost the first shot looking /out/ of the ecliptic disk, and hoo-whee there's this big sucker on an ""11 tries for a dollar"" close encounter of the smack-em-good kind. This is what I love about astrophysics: we have theories as good as anyone else (way better than psychology), and we debate and argue and expound and conference and bellow and blurt about them, but every time we turn on some new kind of robot sensor device to actually /look/ at Reality, well she slaps us right in the face and says in her best Mae West ""Guess again, boys"" -- no other science gets that chance (ok, maybe some do) and there is nothing, _nothing_ more worthless than last semester's astronomy text. --  Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com ""Computers are useless.

Dear Nicety, As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking  up your computer I'm afraid your ""SOL"" as finding a true solution.   There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts  resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many  programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working  in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a  regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened  and closed several different applications. Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional, wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at  http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is  even truer today.  Every current ""worm"" you are hearing about  on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems.   So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change  the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of  weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running  I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over.  I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and  the price is right -- free.

Comments on Site #140:  http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding Margarete MDegaston@aol.com ~~~~ I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate  sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well  presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been  a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site,  preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a  relationship to it. What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something  related to the url  ""prosperouswomen"" to come up, as this  ""word"" was what caught my attention and caused me to  click in the first place. I feel the book page should be a tool for the ""PW"" page and  not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the  book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page. (You need to take e out of changing on the book page.) With these: Find out how you can receive the free book. Email us at directions4U@aol.com         and For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing  write to us at directions4U@aol.com I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than  copy and paste. Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them.  (and I have ordered the book!) ~~~~ I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.   Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics  or where we were headed. ~~~~ Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book. Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish  between the links and that which is not. I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also  linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that  link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site. If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a  request message to an aol email address you would get more  requests, and also might be able to automate this process. ~~~~ I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point. It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.   If only other sites we so simplistic! ~~~~ With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact  on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences  in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box  with ""Life Changeing Insight"" needs the 'e' taken out of  'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended  to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100  year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of  using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where  or how or by whom it was discovered. The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that  would make the site more effective (on getting people to request  the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in  what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to  order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form  for this just about anywhere. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________ Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

I also have received both the virus and email on how to get rid of it.  Luckily I don't open ANY attachments, unless I'm expecting them and then am still very careful. Here's the ways I was told to get rid of the thing: One Fix Tool: Download fix_sircam.com and run the file. It will scan Drive C:\ and subfolders and runs in DOS. http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/security/fix_sircam.com Another Trojan Fix Tool http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/FixSirc.com The fix tool will run from your desktop and will ""automatically"" rid your computer from the SirCam Trojan and clean up an entries from your registry files. After running either fix tool -- reboot your system. Hope this helps!

Dear Nicety, As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking up your computer I'm afraid your ""SOL"" as finding a true solution. There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened and closed several different applications. Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional, wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is even truer today.  Every current ""worm"" you are hearing about on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems.  So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and the price is right -- free.

Comments on Site #140:  http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding Margarete MDegaston@aol.com ~~~~ I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a relationship to it. What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something related to the url  ""prosperouswomen"" to come up, as this ""word"" was what caught my attention and caused me to click in the first place. I feel the book page should be a tool for the ""PW"" page and not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page. (You need to take e out of changing on the book page.) With these: Find out how you can receive the free book. Email us at directions4U@aol.com and For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing write to us at directions4U@aol.com I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than copy and paste. Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them. (and I have ordered the book!) ~~~~ I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page. Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics or where we were headed. ~~~~ Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book. Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish between the links and that which is not. I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site. If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a request message to an aol email address you would get more requests, and also might be able to automate this process. ~~~~ I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point. It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied. If only other sites we so simplistic! ~~~~ With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box with ""Life Changeing Insight"" needs the 'e' taken out of 'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where or how or by whom it was discovered. The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that would make the site more effective (on getting people to request the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form for this just about anywhere. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ 		moderator: Amy Mossel  Moderator posting:   MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________ Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    Moderator@AEOpublishing.com To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

Colin Nevin <colin.nevin@meritsolutions.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,08 Oct 2002 17:34:37 +0000,[ILUG] connecting at 1200bps in RH7.3 (help!),"Hi All,

Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.

The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.

Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?

Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity

I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:

AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1

... which is most of the defaults.

USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)

But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.

btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.

Colin.

The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day.  On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to  see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this  isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one  day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages. Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew  Iraq would be in here somewhere). ""Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,"" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official ""said that only a portion  of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."" Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, ""Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,"" said the San Francisco  Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the  economy. ""Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,"" said the AP.  As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas.

We mean ""foul."" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite  service in the US. The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics --  it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as  some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight? The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified ""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks. The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted  to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the  cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, ""Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns."" The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch  waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar.

The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day.  On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages. Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). ""Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,"" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official ""said that only a portion of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."" Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, ""Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,"" said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the economy. ""Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,"" said the AP.  As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer President Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days (Seattle Times) http://tinyurl.com/1usn  Bush Expected To Act on Ports Crisis  http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/business/1002/08ports.html  President Moves Toward Forcing the Reopening of West Coast Ports http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ports8oct08001439,0,1021983.story  Bush Takes Step Toward Halting Lockout After West Coast Port Talks Break Off (AP) http://tinyurl.com/1usk  White House Intervenes on Docks Dispute (Financial Times) http://tinyurl.com/1usm  Cooling-off Period Likely in Port Fight (SF Chronicle) http://tinyurl.com/1usp  Bush Moves Toward Halting Port Shutdown http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/national/08PORT.html  Trouble On The Docks http://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0864,00.html  (Paid subscription required.)

We mean ""foul."" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US. The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight? The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified ""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks. The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, ""Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns."" The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson EchoStar and Hughes Propose Concessions in Bid to Save Deal http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB103403314258094560,00.html  (Paid subscription required) Regulators Set to Block EchoStar's Hughes Purchase http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1033939901346228393,00.html  (Paid subscription required) 'Last-ditch effort' (Rocky Mountain News) http://tinyurl.com/1upi  EchoStar, Hughes See a Glimmer of Hope http://www.thestreet.com/tech/georgemannes/10046366.html  F.C.C.

I think the summary thingy, with a mail based retreive facility, is a
good alternative. You avoid false positive, only one email to list all
the spam you received in one day, and you have full per user pref.

If your using spamd and you want your users to have some control using
user_prefs then check their ~/spamassassin file.
If your using spamd and you have a site wide only policy then make sure that
spamd is started with the -x option.
If you used the -x option then the only place that it should get the rules from
would be from the local.cf in the /etc/mail/spamassassin directory. Assuming a
default install.

Good! Your opinion of what is spam is unreliable, and therefore, I don't
*want* to trust you. IMHO, that is exactly the case that the trust system is
supposed to sort out. People who incorrectly submit non-spam bulk mail to
razor.

Then those lots of people are unreliable, and therefore will all have
minimal trust, but the people with a decent reliability and therefore trust
level will help us all...

IMHO, due to the number of messages you are sending, and the way you are
discussing TeS, (considering that you know *nothing* about it), certainly
looks like you are simply trying to throw doubt/negativity onto razor.

Personally, I haven't used razor for a few months now because I want to
integrate it into qmail-scanner *without* spam assassin, but haven't had the
time to do that, so even I can't comment on Razor at all.....

Vipul & co, I think it would be great if there was more transparency in the
whole server process, ie, if you know there is a problem, then tell all of
us, this will avoid all the stupid ""Oh, it isn't working again, and it took
me 324 days to work it out"" etc...

Just my $1 worth...

Regards,
Adam

For C++, guru of the week at

with extra material as Herb Sutters Essential C++ and More Essential C++)

Scott Meyers Effective C++, More Effective C++ and Effective STL

MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON
(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND

 Bind configs are one sort of file.

 I think the person asking Kevin the question would like to have a nice
config language like:

 domain: ""bing.com""
 hosts:  www mail arse smeg twitter
 ttl:    20000

 and then using lex & yacc, they could write a program that converts
between that config file, and the tedious bind configs, and maybe even
auto-generate a reverse DNS config file while they are at it.

 Personally, I think they are demented. It's much more a job for something
simple like Sed or Awk. People using lex & yacc just because they can make
baby jesus cry.

Sorry, but exposing folly is not only humorous but also instructive.  It
is only by exposing folly to ridicule that you stop it in the first

  by Guido Gonzato (http://freshmeat.net/users/goccia/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 03:48

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Conversion

About: abcm2ps is a package that converts music tunes from ABC format to
PostScript. Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5, it was developed mainly to
print baroque organ scores that have independant voices played on one or
more keyboards, and a pedal-board. It introduces many extensions to the
ABC language that make it suitable for classical music. 

Changes: Minor bugfixes were made.

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Sound Synthesis

About: amSynth is a realtime polyphonic analogue modeling synthesizer. It
provides a virtual analogue synthesizer in the style of the classic Moog
Minimoog/Roland Junos. It offers an easy-to-use interface and synth
engine, while still creating varied sounds. It runs as a standalone
application, using either the ALSA audio and MIDI sequencer system or the
plain OSS devices. It can be played with an external MIDI controller
keyboard, a software virtual keyboard, or through a MIDI sequencer. All
parameters can be controlled over MIDI. 

Changes: The ALSA driver has been MMAPed for improved performance.
Recordings are now output to .wav files. Minor performance tweaks have
been made on the envelope generators, the build process, etc.

  by Avinash Chopde (http://freshmeat.net/users/avinash1/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:10

Text Processing

About: cdlabelgen is a Perl script that generates printouts suitable for
use as CD jewel case inserts or CD envelopes. Both normal sized cases and
slim cases are handled. cdlabelgen can be used to create table of contents
for music CDs, archival CDs, etc., with customizable logos or background
images, and it generates PostScript files as output. The package also
includes a Perl CGI Web script which accepts JPEG images as logos or
backgrounds, and can also create PDF output files.

Changes: It is now possible to specify line width for the cover/tray edges
or to omit edge lines entirely. Control over logo placement has been
added: logos can now be moved and scaled as required on the output.
Support for A4 page printouts has been added.

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: CD Audio :: CD Writing
System :: Archiving

About: Cdrecord creates home-burned CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW recorder. It
works as a burn engine for several applications. Cdrecord supports CD
recorders from many different vendors; all SCSI-3/mmc and ATAPI/mmc
compliant drives should also work. Supported features include IDE/ATAPI,
parallel-port, and SCSI drives, audio CDs, data CDs, and mixed CDs, full
multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable), TAO, DAO and human-readable
error messages. Cdrecord includes remote SCSI support and can access local
or remote CD-writers.

Changes: cdrecord now writes MCN/ISRC even in RAW mode. A bug that caused
cdrecord to write wrong relative time stamps into the pregap of audio CDs
when writing in RAW mode with pregapsize !=0 has been fixed.

select options, unless the option has been driven with a custom query
(""SQL:......""). It is now possible to choose whether a field has to be
displayed on the details page. Other changes and bugfixes have been added.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 12:57

System :: Archiving :: Backup
System :: Archiving :: Compression
System :: Filesystems

About: The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines
files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. The
restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups can then be
layered on top of the full backup. Single files and directory subtrees may
also be restored from full or partial backups.

Changes: This release fixes a bug (introduced with 0.4b29) which prevented
the use of a remote tape drive.

Communications :: Chat :: Internet Relay Chat
Desktop Environment :: K Desktop Environment (KDE) :: Themes KDE 3.x
Internet

About: KMyIRC is an attempt to provide an IRC client for KDE which is
high-quality and easy to use, but not bloated. It was created because it
was felt that the other KDE-based IRC clients were either not
user-friendly or burdened with features that are not useful to the average
IRC user. 

Changes: This release adds highlight phrases, timestamps in channel
output, and the ability to disable the server list at startup. It fixes
some nasty and serious bugs in 0.2.1.

[046] - Lindenmayer Systems in Python 1.0 
  by Eleventh Hour (http://freshmeat.net/users/xihr/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:52

Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence
Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics
Text Processing :: General

About: Lindenmayer Systems in Python provides a simple implementation of
Lindenmayer systems (also called ""L-systems"" or ""substitution systems"").
In basic form, a Lindenmayer system consists of a starting string of
symbols from an alphabet which has repeated transitions applied to it,
specified by a list of transition search-and-replace rules. In addition to
the standard formulation, two alternative implementations are included:
sequential systems (in which at most one rule is applied) and tag systems
(in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the
string). Despite being implemented entirely in Python, for reasonable
rules on a modern machine, the system is capable of running thousands of
generations per second. Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial
intelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal
patterns (usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle
commands), organic-looking patterns that can simulate plants or other
living things, or even music.

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Operating System
Text Processing

About: OSSP cfg is a ISO-C library for parsing arbitrary C/C++-style
configuration files. A configuration is sequence of directives, each
directive consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a
string or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax
has a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with
arbitrarily-nested sections. The configuration syntax also provides
complex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,
hexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, C/C++
and shell-style comments, etc. The library API allows importing of a
configuration text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), traversing the AST,
and optionally exporting the AST again as a configuration text.

About: OSSP fsl offers the syslog API otherwise provided by libc. Instead
of writing to the syslogd process, it uses the powerful OSSP l2 logging
capabilities. It is a drop-in link-time replacement which enables any
syslog consumer to take advantage of OSSP l2 by just linking this library
in before libc. The program is intended to apply OSSP l2 functionality to
existing syslog-based third-party programs without the requirement to
change the source code of the program.

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Logging

About: OSSP l2 is a C library providing a very flexible and sophisticated
Unix logging facility. It is based on the model of arbitrary number of
channels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with
filtering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave
nodes. Channel trees can be either constructed manually through
lower-level API functions or all at once with a single API function
controlled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. For
generating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided
which can be extended through callback functions. The data flow inside the
channel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are
assigned to each individual channel.

[062] - Papercut NNTP Server 0.8.3 
  by Joo Prado Maia (http://freshmeat.net/users/jcpm/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:34

Communications :: Usenet News
Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules

About: Papercut is a multi-threaded NNTP server written in Python. Its
main objective is to integrate existing Web-based message board software
(Phorum on the first few versions) with a Usenet front-end. However, its
extensibility enables developers to write their own container for the
storage of the Usenet articles (messages). That means that the code is
extensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the
news server with other Web message board projects or even other ways to
store the messages. 

Changes: The various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial
code for NTTP authentication was added. New features include a standalone
MySQL storage module with no Web front-end, an authentication module for
Phorum, and the concept of a 'read-only' / 'read-write' server with
password protection. Most (if not all) of the features are working.

for various data stores will be added in a phased approach. Ultimately, it
will be able to read and edit shape files, display geo-referenced rasters
(TIFF, PNG, and GEOTIFF), create map output, and support database tables.
A plugin feature to dynamically add new functionality is planned.

Changes: This release includes improved rendering of map layers, zoom and
pan capability, and other minor improvements.

  by John Kodis (http://freshmeat.net/users/kodis/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 10:48

Communications :: Ham Radio

About: The station-info program searches for and displays AM, FM, and TV
station entries from databases supplied by the US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). It provides many ways of selecting a collection of
stations for display, and several criteria by which these stations can be
sorted. Detailed information on each station is available, including an
antenna radiation pattern, ownership information, and whatever else seems
useful.  

Changes: This release adds correct displaying of antenna patterns
(previously, they were shown rotated, reversed, and upside down). It also
adds a compass rose and the station callsign to the antenna pattern
display. It accepts station callsigns as location specifications. It
avoids trying to draw in details windows that have been closed. All the
cdbs and .loc files have been moved to $PKGDATADIR (by default,
/usr/local/share/station-info/).

  by sigra (http://freshmeat.net/users/sigra/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 23:04

Software Development :: Testing

About: Valgrind is a tool that helps you find memory management problems
in programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads
and writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as use of
uninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been freed,
reading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing
inappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers to
malloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or
unaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new
[] vs. free/delete/delete []. 

Changes: Support for the x86 fldenv instruction, a fix for an obscure
optimiser bug causing failures like this: ""insane instruction 27: PUTFL
%ecx"", a fix for dying with bus errors running programs which mess with
the x86 AC (alignment-check) flag, fixes to make it compile and run on Red
Hat ""Limbo"" (7.3.92), a fix for a possible assert failure having to do
with free() when running cachegrind (not valgrind), and final manual
adjustments.

About: VNC Reflector is a specialized VNC server which acts as a proxy
between a real VNC server (a host) and a number of VNC clients. It was
designed to work efficiently with large number of clients. It can switch
between different hosts on the fly, preserving client connections. It
supports reverse host-to-reflector connections, it can save host sessions
on disk, and it also has other unique features.  

Changes: Handling of host connections with different desktop geometries
was improved, and support for dynamic changes to desktop size was
implemented. The ability to specify negative display numbers was added. A

Communications :: Email
Communications :: Email :: Mail Transport Agents
Communications :: Email :: Post-Office :: POP3

About: vpopmail (vchkpw) is a collection of programs and a library to
automate the creation and maintenance of virtual domain email
configurations for qmail installations using either a single UID/GID or
any valid UID/GID in /etc/passwd with a home directory. Features are

It supports MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, LDAP, and file-based (DJB constant
database) authentication. It supports SMTP authentication combined with
the qmail-smtp-auth patch. It supports user quotas and roaming users (SMTP
relay after POP authentication). 

Changes: This release adds one last patch for the vgetent problem,
comments out the lseek definition for BSD users, replaces the old
qmail-pop3d-maildirquota patch with the qmail-maildir++ patch (which adds
Maildir++ support not only to qmail-pop3d, but also to qmail-local), and

  by Nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:14

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. It works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la ""C strings"". It can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

Changes: The vstr_export_buf() function now performs automatic bounds
checking in the same way as vstr_export_cstr_buf(). vstr_sc_read_*() now
works even if the vstr isn't configured to have an iovec cache. Work on
internal symbol hiding has been made, making the library smaller and
faster.

Perl, for  Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It displays  full
directory information; allows file viewing,  deleting, renaming,
uploading, downloading, etc.;  assists in directory navigation; and can
execute  any command for which the user account has  privilege.
FileManager also comes with a built-in  text editor for quick editing and
file updates. 

Changes: A security hole that allowed authorized users to view any file on
the system has been fixed. The security certificate has been extended.
Support has been added for 29 more OS types. The find function now works
for non-root, jailed users. A new option controls whether or not a user
can ""click"" outside their home directory tree. The AllowRootUser parameter
can now disable the 'root' user. A bug that prevented non-root, jailed
users from creating subdirectories, a ""group"" permissions access problem,
and a bug in the ""Command Line"" box which prevented using the asterisk
wildcard have all been fixed.

  by Jiri Tobisek (http://freshmeat.net/users/tobich/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 18:39

Text Editors

About: The goal of the XMLtype project is to create a console-based editor
of XML document-oriented files in UTF-8 encoding. It is designed from the
beginning for multilingual use, even for writing bi-directional texts
(e.g. mixed English and Hebrew). The design focuses on comfortable and
fast typing of well-formed XML documents. Thus XMLtype is not meant to
compete with advanced console editors like Emacs or VIM. For full
functionality, XMLtype requires UTF-8 console support. It is being
developed under Linux and for the ANSI/VT-100 terminal. 

Changes: This release fixes an ugly I/O bug caused by previous bugfixing.

Despite being the author of SpamAssassin, I've never fixed exmh to do
this.  I am therefore clearly not an exmh hacker ;)

But to simplify -- the first action is piping the message to an external
command, then replacing the message file with the output; and the second
is simply piping the message to another command, then ignoring the output.
I'd say it's easy enough to do, if someone can provide the tcl.

There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of
fair use in the US.  For example, audio recordings have such an
exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't
(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can
control what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certain
industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --
there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such
privileges on.

The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in
business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever
accused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to make
money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no
""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is
more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a
profit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable
business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few
people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically
""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar
activities, but that is mostly just for show.

Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to
its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious
price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.

I added code to my procmailrc (on the other account) so that anything that 
comes on Bugtraq and is in Razor is revoked. Bugtraq is moderated, so spam

Hettinga Sunday, August 25, 2002 (BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs. Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war between thugs. Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's ""family"" were, of course, the (mostly) Italian thugs. Think Scorsese's upcoming ""Gangs of New York"", only with counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston ""social-club"" putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US, only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all. The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was, posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine - -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets, like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of magnitude, not mere percentage points. As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that ""quality"" of carnage, nation-wide. So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger. However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was ""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence -- on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door, but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous ""bluenoses and busybodies"". It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller, ""manageable"" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition, in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on. Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now, apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly-legislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry. As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people, breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time. And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even, *especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us. And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati. In fact, Hayek himself, in ""The Road to Serfdom"", couldn't have predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant imposition, ""for our own good"", of Vietnam-era statist power at the neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had better ""useful idiots"" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover. Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting, movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now strictly political, descendents. In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr. Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transfer-price"", in human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style Vietnam-era Keynesian ""social-cost"" input-output accounting at its most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a race war between thugs up in Boston. This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right"" reasons. As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit. Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and, what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J. Edgar Hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead. ""Bandit Queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens -- and real bandits -- everywhere.

Edgar Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca. Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr. Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan, ""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an F.B.I. log of the conversation. ""Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,"" the F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an alley, shot six times. It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England Mafia was involved. But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing to do with it. One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I. for $300 million for false imprisonment. His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled, corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston office in its effort to bring down the mob. The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light, including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston. The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution. ""J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself,"" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. ""He allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants."" Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark who worked for Mr. Barboza. Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr. Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and Stephen Flemmi are brothers. The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr. Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime, including who fired the first shot. Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer. In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca ""potentially could be an excellent informant."" The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue to commit murder."" Nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's potential outweighs the risk involved."" A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""The most frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders, the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""There is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant."" The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I. agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr. Bulger. Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while the F.B.I. looked the other way. One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr. Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device, the investigators say. Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence. Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974. Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30 years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each other. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb 3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI =OELD -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- --  ----------------- R.

No panic,

I'm all for cleaning things up before getting it optimized.

I think everybody has their own version of this,
but in case it's useful.. (only tested on Linux):

find $* \( -type f -o -type l \) -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -print0 |
xargs -r0 du -b --max-depth 0 |
sort -k1n |
grep -v ""^0""

Pdraig.

A piece of string and his friend walks into a bar.  The barman says

One year ago today, my (now former) manager told me to shut down my weblog and 
remove all traces of it from my server. He tried to convince me that the 
Internet was too small to mix the professional[1] and the personal[2]. 

One year ago today, I gave him my answer[3], and the rest is history[4]. 

Today, to celebrate this anniversary, I would like everyone to read my resume
[5], admire this full-screen picture of my cat[6], and link to this post[7]. 

There are four lights.

Date: Not supplied

We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 
Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 
abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 
they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 
End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not 
capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 
information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 
every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 
(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 
relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 
programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 
dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking 
for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 
ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 
trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing 
only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first 
place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 
always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 
relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 
Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 
every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 
this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 
a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) 

Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 
information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 
the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 
workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, 
which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I 
have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking 
package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the 
system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ 
bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. 

A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does 
FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 
purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 
what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 
feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 
is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the 
other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 
existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 
biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 
to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 
but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 
of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 
happy and keep buying more site licenses. 

But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 
software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 
our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 
who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 
yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 
built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 
inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 
it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for 
their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because 
of it. 

Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 
hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)

why?

or more specifically, what do you mean?  on one hand you can optimise
how gcc is compiled.  all that will do is make it generate the exact
same code just a smidge faster.  and since gcc is such a memory pig,
you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep
gcc's heap out of swap.

on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's
code generation.  um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck.
i can't express that enough.  compilers should just work.  perfectly.
always.  doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane.
they're hard to trace and you'd better have a deep knowledge of what's
going on to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it
yourself.  plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes
to get large speed boosts on x86 chips.

  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web
  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings

  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network

  ###

  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.

  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.

  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.

  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.

  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.

  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""

  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the
  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.""

  About Magi
  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms
  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration
  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can
  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and
  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work
  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming
  unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent
  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as
  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical
  interface, and universal name spaces generating ""follow me URLs"" for mobile
  professionals.

D'oh. I ment to say that I cant use a laptop, as I have a pci wireless
card and the cable for it (about 180 dollars). So it has to be a pc, with
a pci 2.2 connector (ie some pentiums, and anything above)

I'd do that with my 166, but the psu has a fan. And a 486 wont support my
wireless card :( I know. I'm awkward,

Exactly what rights you would have to the code depends on the contractual
arrangement you have with your client, and I'm betting that that's not at
all cut and dried.

However, I have been in this situation where a client was using code I
developed and then decided that he should own the code. Push never came to
shove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a
vis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of
the code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't
take legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him
that I was right and would most likely win in court.

So much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for
the GPL issues. 

Code compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself
covered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps
not made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which
Microsoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of
your customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever
you like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and
you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another
service provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR
code under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.

If OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then
distributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified
code must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to
PHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.

The relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when
locate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about
any Linux box - 540 on this box)

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.


Your PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or
in part.

> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated

Microsoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply
that any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and
it must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?

I am now preparing a small patch to configure.in for NetBSD (possibly
also useful for Open- and FreeBSD, don't know). Should be ready and
tested in the next half hour.

If you think 2.40 is ready, I would suggest to wait just 24 hours more
for possible reports by b2_4_0 users. Not everyone can follow the
development during daytime (at work).

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to
postscript and png.  You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you
have x installed.

So Eugen, how many of your homo friends have -had- 3k lovers?

In fact, thats a general question for FoRK proper.

Just a quick assumption here.   I'm not a math geek or anything, but

Gregory Alan Bolcer <gbolcer@endeavors.com>,FoRK <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>,"Mon, 26 Aug 2002 07:43:03 -0700",UCI Creative Writing,"More articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is the
center of the universe.  We've got the corner on electric
cars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,
outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.

UCI's creative writing department has been in the 
news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Some
quotes from the article[1]:

   ""In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop
    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's
    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring
    and uncannily timely novel. 

The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's ""The
Lovely Bones"" which is on the way to the top of the 
NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease me
about UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobody
knew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,
I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UC
schools, and when I went off to college in 1985, my
relatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. 
I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's 
faculty called ""the art of writing fiction"".   If there
was ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing
my dissertation, it was that one which taught me how to
get the writing flowing and my high school typing class
which taught me how to type really fast.  

One of the advantages they cite in the article is that they
seem to take a chance on the ""not-so-sure"" bet, but according
to the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone on
to write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry
is creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which
creates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out more
success stories which lures more talent.

The ADR (Advanced Digital Recording) tape format is an interesting
option, one I hadn't seen much of, before.  Look as if OnStream (spun
off from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly
control the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make
compatible media under licence.

If you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a
rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn
(and well before they start failing).  That requires at least a couple
of dozen tapes for the first couple of years.  Therefore, cost and
availability of media are (or should be) a major factor.  Also, tape
heads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan
systems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always
ends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy
competition.

The less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is
that, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement
that would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another 
OnStream ADR drive.  In that sense, you're somewhat locked in:  I'm 
not seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed
them).  

If OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into
the system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they 
get people to buy in.   I see the following prices for mail order 
(http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes:

42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape
33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape.
44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
47 euros for ADR cleaning tape.

(You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.)

Capacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression
ratio.  The PDF datasheet for Onstream's ""ADR2"" series says this is a
linear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT,
and LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and
8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads).

I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite
Technology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives.  My recollection
is that BRU will do it.

On balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3
or DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one
oddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the
experience.  But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed,
and might be a good bet after all.  As they say in the gaming industry,
""Ya pays your money, and ya takes your chances.""

Expats help Hindi films make dollars and sense even at their own expense

By JEANNE E. FREDRIKSEN

The expatriate in films is nothing new. Casablanca starring Humphrey 
Bogart as the suave, mysterious Rick in Morocco remains the top favorite 
60 years after its release in America. Although expat characters' lives 
are traditionally painted as being extraordinary, the simple fact that 
they live ""elsewhere"" adds a sense of adventure, a dash of romance, and 
a bit of wishful longing. However, expats have never made the kind of 
impact on films that non-resident Indians (NRIs) have with Hindi cinema, 
both at the box office and on the big screen.

According to India's 2001 census, the country's population exceeded the 
1 billion persons milestone, and there are approximately 11 million 
Indians living, working, and studying elsewhere around the world. NRIs 
have become a serious market for the Hindi film industry, particularly 
in the U.K., where approximately 3 percent of the population is 
Indian/Pakistani, and in the U.S., where 1.7 million out of 281.5 
million people are Indian. The rupee box office is now augmented quite 
handsomely by the dollar-and-pound box office, much to the delight of 
directors and producers.

Among the films reporting a half-to-three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar 
box office in the U.S. or the U.K. are Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), Kaho 
Naa Pyaar Hai (2000), Refugee (2000), Lajja (2001), and Asoka (2001). 
The NRI ""million-dollar-box-office club"" boasts such films as Yaadein 
(2001) and Lagaan (2001) in the U.S. Taal (1999), Hum Saath Saath Hain 
(HSSH, 1999), and Mohabbatein (2000) made the mark or better in the U.K. 
Taal and HSSH doubled their U.K. intakes in the U.S. and brought in $2 
million each. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) tallied up $2.6 million in the 
U.K. Most recently, setting a new high-water mark in the overseas box 
office, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G, 2001) grabbed the No. 10 spot its 
first week of release in the U.S. and earned $2.9 million during its 
five-week run. In the U.K., K3G earned nearly $3.6 million over an 18 
week run.

Impressive? Yes, considering that promotion of Hindi films outside of 
the Indian community is virtually zero, although that may be on the 
brink of changing slightly. If nothing else, the figures indicate that 
the NRI spends a big chunk of change on the films.

During the past decade, the inclusion of NRI characters in both 
commercial and non-commercial films has been on the rise, and in a 
circular logic, it's only natural that they have become a part of these 
films' stories. Each NRI touches someone in India, and these ""global 
Indians,"" as filmmaker Subhash Ghai has called them, cannot be shrugged 
off as a passing phase. Films featuring or ""made for"" NRIs have been 
criticized by some in India, but in reality, many of those films have 
performed extremely well at the Indian box office. Could this speak to 
the lure of adventure and the romance of the NRI?

The first Hindi blockbuster to spotlight NRI characters was Dilwale 
Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ, 1995), the story of two young people who grew 
up Indian in London. DDLJ introduced us to the mischievous, 
prank-pulling Raj, who in the beginning fails to graduate but succeeds 
in pilfering a case of beer from an Indian-owned convenience store. In 
the end, he steadfastly applies Indian sensibilities in his pursuit of 
the rebellious-but-trapped Simran as her unwanted arranged marriage 
approaches. Very possibly, because of this juxtaposition of traits, 
attitudes, and events, DDLJ enjoys the distinction of being the 
longest-continually-running film in Indian cinema history.

Popularity aside, there is the ongoing issue regarding accuracy in the 
characterization of NRIs in films. Often they are drawn as stereotypes, 
which are easy to lean on, requiring neither depth nor dimension. 
Because of this, Hindi filmmakers may be said to straddle the border 
separating East and West, staying securely at home and dipping into 
their highly-fantasized world of the Indian diaspora.

In many cases, commercial Hindi films present an overly-devised sense of 
the NRI as being either corruptly-Westernized or as being more homesick 
than a child gone away to camp for the first time. While these concepts 
may carry a certain truth, the corresponding misconceptions come from 
the minds of the at-home Indians, who wag a seemingly-envious finger at 
the NRI's ability to exist in two worlds: one allowing space and upward 
mobility, the other offering traditions and history.

Pompous, materialistic, alcohol-drinking, cigarette-smoking, 
drug-taking, affair-having, spoiled brats 

The first Hindi film I saw was Subhash Ghai's Pardes (1997). Despite 
encouraging me to see more films, it made me wonder if ""NRI"" actually 
meant ""Not Really Indian."" If the NRI characters weren't silly, whiney 
troublemakers, they were mean and nasty, embracing every possible 
negative human quality in stark contrast to the pristine Kusum Ganga. 
Even the dialogue and song lyrics in the film were designed to instruct 
the viewer that the West is inferior but one can still bring India back 
into one's life. The film is propaganda at its finest and filled with 
relentless reminders of good vs. evil, purity vs. corruption, right vs. 
wrong, traditional vs. modern  in short India vs. the West.

But this is not where the negativity ends.

Very often, there is a ""dress code"" for the female characters to help 
the viewer understand her measure of purity or wickedness: the more 
traditionally-dressed, the more Indian the woman. Unsurprisingly, this 
does not seem to carry over to the men's characters.

Running alongside this can be the ""training guide"" in which NRIs are 
constantly reeducated that ""This is not India ,"" ""This is not America 
,"" ""Only in India ,"" ""This is our culture."" The repetition seems less 
designed to be a natural part of life than to foster reinforcement, as 
if NRIs are too ignorant to appreciate it the first time.

When Indians achieve success and wealth, have large homes, and own their 
companies in these films, they are industrious, clever, and respected 
businessmen. The NRI equivalent is held up to a double standard and 
considered materialistic. Even the printed synopsis of Taal in the Eros 
Entertainment/B4U DVD booklet refers to the NRI characters' ""world of 
ruthless materialism."" On the other hand, the Mumbai-based, plagiarizing 
Vikrant Kapoor character is likeable enough and presented as an 
opportunist, which seems to be a step up.

Italy is an unlikely origin for an NRI and offspring in a Hindi film, 
but Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (2000) filled the bill. For all the film's 
splendor, it was regrettable that the Indo-Italian Sameer was presented 
as a nave, bumbling nerd who had little going for him beyond his 
singing ability.

Yaadein gave us a kind and loving, if slightly confused, single parent 
from London raising three daughters who suffer enough issues to put a 
therapist into a tailspin. As if that weren't enough, the film includes 
an American-raised brat who wants nothing to do with parents, settling 
down, or having babieshardly the ideal Indian bride-to-be.

And what happens when a married NRI couple splits into the ""modern"" vs. 
the ""old-fashioned?"" The wife is tossed out like the garbage and sent 
home to India as punishment for being unreceptive to having affairs 
outside of marriage. Such is the initial setup for Lajja, Rajkumar 
Santoshi's look into the world of Indian women.

Show me the way to go home 

The other extreme of NRIs in film is the homesick, culture-craving, 
more-patriotic-than-thou Indian. Building their own mini-Indias for 
maxi-memories, this NRI portrayal takes a real issue and magnifies it to 
unreal proportions. And no film illustrates that as extravagantly as the 
lush and sumptuous Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (K3G).

Not only did K3G enjoy a healthy run at home, it exploded worldwide onto 
theater screens in Indian communities last December and played to packed 
houses for weeks. And K3G is a film in which everythinghomes, 
transportation, finances, fashion, holidays, events, emotions, and 
tearssets a new standard for the term ""larger-than-life.""

In K3G, much of the post-interval footage takes place in England. For 
Anjali, life in London simmers with a patriotic zeal and an 
all-consuming homesickness manifested in the meticulous maintenance of 
Indian customs and rituals while she separates herself from her 
surroundings. Her need for India is so overwhelming that she relies on 
the false protection of mocking people and places outside of her own 
family and home.

Overkill? Certainly, as writer-director Karan Johar's inflated 
representation of what have become some of the filmi passions of the 
typical NRI. But when it boils down to the common denominators without 
the fanfare, flash, and fervor, even those who move across country miss 
their families and familiar surroundings; one always retains a credible 
amount of home-turf loyalty; and if one's heritage is lost, the person 
is rendered as no more than a racial statistic.

""Those living in India are surrounded by our culture every minute, even 
if they don't realize it,"" says Vivek Malhotra, a thirty-something NRI 
and business owner in the Chicago area. ""Here it's different, but we 
will always be Indian,"" he continues, striking at the heart of the 
perceived problem. ""Sometimes, I feel that the movies think we've 
forgotten that. Maybe the filmmakers should spend some time finding out 
who we are. I really don't think they have a clue.""

On the upside is a beneficial aspect for the children of NRIs. ""It's 
good that these films show our kids what happens in Indiathe 
traditions, customs, values,"" says Parag Gandhi, a long time theater 
owner and promoter of Hindi films in Chicago. ""They may be modernized in 
India, but the traditional values remain."" And many popular films target 
the late-teens, twenty-something demographic. ""Films such as Dilwale 
Dulhania Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, and K3G,"" adds Gandhi, ""are 
examples of films that are half traditional, half modern, striking a 
balance between the two for all of the markets.""

Another positive consideration is that not all films show NRIs in a 
questionable light. Caricatures of NRIs have been challenged in 
commercial films like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Dil Chhata Hai (2001), Monsoon 
Wedding (2001), and the recent Kitne Door Kitne Paas, all of which 
present NRIs as more realistic, more human characters. Aa Ab Laut Chalen 
offers a variety of NRI personalities from the selfish, the conniving, 
and the party animal to the lovable cabbies and the pandit-cop who make 
the best of their situations without complaint. Interestingly, the film 
also dares to include shop owners, Dunkin' Donuts clerks, gas station 
attendants: characters who aren't weighed down by palatial surroundings, 
corporate crises, or overseas judgments.

The U.S., the U.K., and Australia are represented in Bombay Boys (1999) 
by three young men coming/returning to Bombay, India for personal 
reasons. In a refreshing reversal of the typical attitude concerning 
NRIs in film, the boys are the ""good"" Indians, and everyone they meet 
has some relationship with the darker side of the city. At its most 
basic, the film shows that if something is lost, it won't necessarily be 
found in India.

Even the non-commercial, multi-award-winning Bawandar (2001) 
incorporates an NRI as a connecting thread in the piecing together of 
Sanvri Devi's story. Curious, passionate about women's rights, the 
Indo-English journalist represents the fact that the story has a wider 
interest than a small, rural village.

Stepping outside of the Hindi film industry for a moment, the 
English/Telegu film Hyderabad Blues (1998) and the English/Tamil film 
MitrMy Friend (2002), both smaller-budget films built on delivering 
messages without preaching, deserve mention. The former engages in the 
questioning of, rather than the criticism of, East vs. West, and the 
latter examines the challenges faced by women, NRIs, and their families. 
The characters and stories of both films enjoy respect in their 
presentation, partially due to the existence of layered issues that are 
revealed and resolved (or not) without finger-snapping swiftness or 
clichd answers. Hyderabad Blues enjoyed a 31-week run in Mumbai alone, 
and MitrMy Friend is currently one of the most-rented films in Indian 
communities in the U.S.

While the inclusion of NRIs in Hindi films does not guarantee box office 
success outside of India, it does send a strong signal that filmmakers 
acknowledge this constantly growing and lucrative audience sector. If 
the big-budget, big box-office commercial films coming out of Mumbai 
often seem to bite one of the hands that feeds it, has the box office 
anywhere been adversely affected? Well  no, not by any charted reports 
that can be found. And that, itself, sends a loud and clear message back 
to the industry in Mumbai: ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it.""

Nevertheless, when filmmakers who see NRIs as falling only to the evil 
side of Western ways look beyond their assumptions, perhaps they will 
discard their reliance on stereotypes and start paying their overseas 
family an increased measure of respect. And when filmmakers who take the 
homesick and patriotic themes beyond believability analyze their own 
feelings, perhaps they will realize that what NRIs hold dear in their 
hearts is no different from what those at home should be proud of. n

Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge

So globally successful is the film that in 1999 it warranted a billboard 
outside Shinjuku train station in Tokyo, Japan, announcing its 
screenings sponsored by India Center there. Shinjuku is the 
entertainment center of Tokyo, and there is plenty of high-profile 
competition for attention, attendance, and box office. In Japan, where 
Indian films enjoy a certain popularity with the natives, the country's 
1995 population census of 125.6 million persons showed only 4,244 were 
Indian with an additional 13,589 being other South Asians. Without 
question, DDLJ continues to be a favorite whenever, wherever offered for 
viewing.

Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham

According to a report in the South China Morning Post in January, 2002, 
all screenings of K3G in December, 2001, were sell-outs in Hong Kong, 
while pirated copies of the film were the hottest items circulating on 
the island. Hong Kong's 2001 population census of 6.3 million people 
revealed that 18,543 were Indian and another 23,581 were Nepalese and 
Pakistani. K3G's popularity in the Special Administrative Region was 
impressive because Hong Kong enjoys being the third-largest producer of 
films by volume after India and the U.S.

Bhansali's Musical Heaven

By ANIRUDDH CHAWDA

DEVDAS (Universal, 2002). Hindi film soundtrack. Music: Ismail Darbar. 
Lyrics: Nusrat Badr

For perhaps the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, filmmaker 
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas had to deliver a score that not only met 
the hype but also let Ismail Darbar prove that the mega-selling Hum Dil 
De Chuke Sanam was no one-time flash in the pan. By devising a 
semi-classical, once-in-a-decade, 100 percent ""Indian"" musical score, 
Bhansali and Darbar emerge victorious in baking and serving a 10-layer 
monumental soundtrack.

What is most groundbreaking is the powerful one-two punch of lyrics by 
newcomer Nusrat Badr and the from-soul-voice of first-timer Shreya 
Ghosal. Ghosal's voice, reminiscent of both Suman Kalyanpur with a 
slightly thicker pitch and Anuradha Paudwal without the nasal monotone, 
is the most original singing voice since Kavita Subramaniam appeared in 
the Mangeshkar mold. Ghosal's ""Silsila ye chaahat ka"" is a sultry 
tabla-dominated opening to 52 minutes of sheer musical bliss. ""Maar 
daala"" (Subramaniam, KK) is an excellent example of the use of classical 
ragas to complement, rather than fill-in, interludes between verses. On 
""Kahe chhed,"" Pandit Birju Maharaj, using his own tune, adds an 
intoxicating opening for Madhuri Dixit's vocals and Subramaniam to 
finish out a piercing song of longing.

While a combination of Ghosal and Subramaniam give life to on-screen 
lip-synching for Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai, on the male side Udit 
Narayan fronts for Shah Rukh Khan. Narayan's on-target ""Bairi piya,"" a 
duet with Ghosal, could find company in many Lata-Rafi duets of yore. 
The up-tempo ""Chalak chalak"" again smoothly floats Narayan with Vinod 
Rathod and Ghosal while Subramaniam and Ghosal's jugalbandhi on ""Dola re 
dola"" simply shakes the rafters.

Packaged in Universal's Bombay plant, the earliest CD pressings have a 
cheap, paper-thin casing. Purists may consider replacing the cheap cover 
with a store-bought sturdier one. At a suggested Bombay retail value of 
about $2 and selling like hot cakes stateside for $10 a pop, Devdas is 
without doubt a huge profit-maker for the multinational music marketer. 
But buyers beware: avoid being distracted by bootleg CDs. This 
exceptional music and exceptionally well-recorded CD deserve 
unadulterated musical glory. Pop in only a properly copyrighted, 
original CD and let Darbar & Co. whisk you away on a magical musical 
ride.

Lifelong cinephile Aniruddh Chawda lives, works, and writes from 
Wisconsin, on America's north coast.

Well it seems Bruce Perens agrees with me, only he's going one better, instead of just mouthing off about it, he's going to do it and do it  in a big way ...     Open source campaigner to risk jail     By James Middleton [24-07-2002]     Bruce Perens plans live DVD hack     With the dust from the Elcomsoft/Sklyarov case still thick in the     air, influential open source activist Bruce Perens plans to go one     better by breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)     during a live presentation on Friday.     Fresh from giving RealNetworks a slating for not completely     backing open source with its latest announcement, Perens said that     during a Digital Rights Management presentation to be held Friday     at the O'Reilly developer conference in San Diego, he would break     the law.     The DMCA has been a sore point in the open source community since     the outlawing of DeCSS, a tool created so that DVDs could be     played on Linux machines, and more recently since the arrest of     Dmitry Sklyarov and the criminal charges faced by his employer,     Elcomsoft.     Based on the recent history of DMCA contravention, Perens could     face imprisonment or a $500,000 fine for his actions.     According to Infoworld the demonstration is to be carried out in     protest at the regional system used by the motion picture industry     to prevent DVDs released in one country being played on machines     in another country.     During his presentation, Perens will demonstrate how to hack a DVD     player so that it can play movies from any region.     ""It is a political and social statement, and the statement is that     the people do not need to have a hall monitor living in their     stereo system and should be able to play any kind of media on the     device they wish,"" he was quoted as saying.     But luck may be on his side, if last year is anything to go by. At     the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the     triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the     same slides that got Sklyarov arrested. http://www.vnunet.com/News/1133862 --  Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com ""Computers are useless.

I worked on a testharness for (wait for it) petrol pumps some years ago,
little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest
environment to track crashing bugs under) master which logged its
piteous whinings. I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on
creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating
one showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I'm
sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for
me.

Oh thats right Greg.  Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush
folks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article is
this again?

Lets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.
Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to
be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few
years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have
changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy
_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the
pro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn't do enough
of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.

I'll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.
If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably
assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?
Probably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this
scenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I
falsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.

I'll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to
chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting
down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a
span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the
rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you
question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in
general, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of
the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an
anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles
away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.
I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats
speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting
over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other
way.

Getting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea to
an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is?   How
do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience
without violating the rules of the regime?  I don't think Mr. Nell was
throwing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause
physical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.
California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that
has the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has
the option to leave.


Just my .02, while its still considered legal.

Feorag writes from Scotland: ""You probably haven't heard of John Otway, but he 
has a small and devoted following here. He did a limited issue CD and asked his 
fans to vote on which track _they'd_ like to see as a single. The one they 
picked just entered the UK charts at number 9! Bet that'll piss off the major 
record labels, especially as the marketing budget was probably about zero. I 
might just watch Top of the Pops this week."" Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks,

*Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software

Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law.

Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.

In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.

Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists.

On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).

Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

*Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest

San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.

Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.

In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!

Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.

Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
technologies.

The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
artists to share with one another and their fans

Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.

When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm

Where: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the
Japanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive

I have been using 2.4.19 since a couple of days on a Mandrake 8.2 with
standard RPMs for cdrecord and it didn't give any hard locks on it at
all, i've already burnt a couple of CDs.

you might be interested in this. 

A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.

The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very
seriously.

Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my
sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 2000
PAID members in my downline!

As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I
have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?

I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)

Well, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my downline. This
in a program that I had never worked!

All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
downline of 2365 people.

You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!

I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this
program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!

With this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS.
My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.

How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check
out this opportunity and watch your downline grow?

To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:gitrman@excite.com
and write this phrase:
""Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities""
Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your Free Member Number.

I'll get you entered and let you know how you can
keep track of your growing downline.

That's all there's to it.

I'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Warm regards,

Bruce Stevens

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.

So I suppose you could setup half of the raid1, copy your partitions across,
vi lilo to append the new device labels, /dev/md0 instead of /dev/hda...
re-run lilo, then raidhotadd /dev/xxx /dev/md0 [or is that the other way
around?]

I have never tried this so this could be bollix, I have setup root-raid
systems but during install time, I have had drive failures on my
""production"" systems at home and successfully re-built the raid many times.
IMHO linux software raid is extremely good.

When are we going to have a pint?

--------------------------
 I've a running system, and I want to set it up so that the disks are
mirrored. I'll win a little more read speed, and a lot more reliability.

 However, the RAID_HOWTO just mentions RAID 1 and RAID 0 on a machine
that's new. They don't mention anything about an existing setup. Is it
possible to setup disk mirroring on a running box ?

The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing 

ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his 
appearance in order to secure food 
more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he 
pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd 
by his costume. In the evening he was shut up by 
the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, 
and the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the 
shepherd, returning to the fold during the night 
to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly 
caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and 
killed him instantly. 
Harm seek. harm find.

Sure.  I described it the way I understand it to another person off 
list a little while ago.


It has a couple different definitions.  The most common is Luser 
[sic] Attitude Readjustment Tool.  It was first used to describe the 
reporting of spam to ISPs that didn't think spam was bad.  Their 
attitude needed a little readjusting.  It has since taken on the 
generic meaning of reporting email/security incidents to the 
appropriate parties.  Somewhere the definition is online.  I can't 
seem to find the page though.


LART is about as good a word as any to describe reporting 
Rumplestiltskin attacks.  Come to think of it, I generally get a much 
better response to spam LARTs than I do to LARTs for other things. 
I'm always careful to say in the LART that the massive amounts probes 
on our system disrupted service to our customers and that we 
therefore consider it a DoS attack.  That tends to ellict a better 
response.  I also either include a log snippet in the email or I dump 
it to a file and make it accessible on a web server with other logs 
of hosts that abused our mail server.  That helps too. :)

Dear Friend,
                
We are desparately looking for 100 lazy people
who wish to make lots of money without working.

We are not looking for people who are self-motivated.
We are not looking for people who join every 'get rich

We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.

We want the laziest people that exist - the guys and
gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.
We want the people who stay in bed until noon.
We want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go

If you meet this criteria, go to this site and join free:

PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN
HIS CLOSET!

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -
New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old
sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.

""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old
woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my
husband earns in a year"".

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of 
""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.

""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name
on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever
15-year-old.

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list.

The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.

""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a
yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I
was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Over
the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  The
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 
fifties and hundreds.

""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next
bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid.The reporting news 

team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was
completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,
Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in
the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.

Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee.

[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What 
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
 YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you
say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the
 Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".


DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER
THAN EVER.


Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when
I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.

In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the
following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money
for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was 
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"".

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions
and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I
only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I
have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change
anything."" More testimonials later but first,

++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT
 CORNER in case of any mail problems.

 When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.


IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of
your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!


1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.


PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on
your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a
disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:


METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.


With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals
100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000
orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES
$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......
Grand Total=$555,550.00


NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people
mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on 
the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!


METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response.


We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all
orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.

=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always
send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

+++ If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks,
continue sending e-mails until you do. =orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT #2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until
you do.

+++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different
report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you
can generate from this business!!!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works
exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your
name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers
you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, 
materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on
me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.
I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".

Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big"".

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I
should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone
else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete
this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money
came within 22 weeks"".

If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one. Want to find out more about PGP? You can get the software from: PGPfreeware  GnuPG (GPG)  Bring the following:    *  Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity)    *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key size I will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys. It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then person B can check off that person on their list. The reverse is then done for person B. After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using your private key. Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.

Elias Sinderson <elias@cse.ucsc.edu>,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 02 Oct 2002 11:40:38 -0700",Re: Wifi query,"802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.

Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.


Give me bandwidth or give me death,

###  **Government Personal and Business Grants Facts:**

**Over 20 Million People Get Government Money Every Year:**

1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money to start or expand a business

4,000,000 people get money to invest in real estate

6,000,000 people get money to go to college

10,000,000 people get free help and training for a better job

  
---  
  
##  **Getting Business Grants**

> Anyone thinking about going into business for themselves, or wanting to
> expand an existing business should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-
> money-shop"" where FREE business grants to start or expand a business is
> being held for you by the Federal Government.

It sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source of
free business help delivers:

Over $30 billion dollars in free business grants and low-interest loans;

over one-half trillion dollars in procurement contracts; and

over $32 billion dollars in FREE consulting and research grants.

> With an economy that remains unpredictable, and a need for even greater
> economic development on all fronts, the federal government is more willing
> than it ever has been before to give you the money you need to own your own
> business and become your own boss!

In spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly huge
that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for an equal
share, they would each receive over $70,000.

Most people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who to
contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do receive
FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you should also.

##  **Government Grants for Personal Need**

> Help to buy a new home for low income families, repair your home, rent,
> mortgage payments, utility bills, purchase a new car, groceries, childcare,

> lessons, any extracurricular activities, pay bills for senior citizens, real
> estate taxes, medical expenses and general welfare. If you or someone you

that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
respect for its users.

http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html

There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html

""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
party or otherwise) was in development.

All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
place.

But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
is not allowed to load.

It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands
something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public
APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.

But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. """,0,1

The Philippines suffers from a Spanish-imposed aristocratic landowner
class, the same as in most of Latin America, with the serf-like
relationships that go with it.  You have multiple generations of
peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a
human parts of the property package.

The problem in the Philippines is that the landowner class is fading,
but the peasants are still operating under the old economic assumption
even though it isn't being imposed on them in most cases.  In a number
of areas, you have landowners that don't use their lands during bad
years (i.e. when sugar prices fall too low or some other condition that
makes planting unprofitable in the global economy) and in some cases
have all but abandoned them, but when they come back to plant crops
several years later they find the same peasants living on the fallow
land as scratch farmers to survive and waiting for the landowner to come
back and give them something to do.

The government's solution to this was to ""redistribute"" fallow land to
the peasants that lived on them, and created a number of problems in the
process.  First of all, it meant that all the agricultural producers had
to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) or the government would
seize the land and give it to someone else, which is not economically
optimal by any means.  Second when they give it to the peasants, they
use it to become scratch farmers, which is not a particularly productive
economic activity, and the landowners generally let them do that for
free when the land is fallow anyway.  Third, the peasants generally
*prefer* to work for the landowner rather than own the land themselves;
they make more money, have more opportunities to become middle-class,
and enjoy a better lifestyle under that arrangement.  So the result of
all this is that the landowners either run an economically sub-optimal
agriculture business to protect their lands, or they risk having their
land seized without compensation and given to the peasants/squatters who
will gladly sell it back to the plantation owner rather than becoming
scratch farmers, another economically sub-optimal solution. The only
real role of the government in this arrangement is to be a drag on the
economy.

And I don't know about 20 years for land titles in the Philippines.  It
takes a little longer than in the US (though not much), and you may have
to bribe someone to make it work well in an expedited manner, but it
isn't that onerous in the regions I'm familiar with.

Speaking as a former Philippine plantation owner. (Yes, really. On
Negros and Cebu. Have I led a strange life or what?)

er, i understood you until you reached the above. Maybe its my lack of PHP

With most languages you parse the submitted form data and should come out 
with either variables or an array / hash, which you then work with and name 
whatever you like.

**Techs rise, but Dow falls on day of Bush speech**  
Technology shares climbed Monday as Pres. Bush gave a speech outlining a plan
for long-term growth.

Tech investors also heard positive comments on Intel by C.S. First Boston, and
snapped up shares in the chip, storage and computer server hardware sectors.
CNET's Tech index rose 15.22 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,005.33, and the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 9.04 points, or 0.65 percent, to
1,382.54.

Amid news of a weakening dollar and an unexpected rise in business inventories
in May, broader markets sank. Recovering some from early-day losses, the Dow
Jones industrials finished by giving up 45.4 points, or 0.52 percent, to
8,639.1, and the S&P; 500 slid 3.47 points, or 0.38 percent, to 917.92.

**Will IBM's new ""Shark"" sink or swim?**  
IBM announced a new top-end ""Shark"" storage system Monday that could boost the
company's prospects against entrenched competitors in the depressed storage
market. Three years ago, IBM introduced its first Enterprise Storage System
product, code-named Shark, in an attempt to rebuild a market it had almost
totally ceded to rivals EMC and Hitachi Data Systems.  
 **INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 71.00 2.59%**

**New products help absorb AMD pain**  
Advanced Micro Devices turned out two new chips Monday, but its most
anticipated release this week will be its second quarter results. As expected,
AMD launched on Monday a new mobile Athlon XP 1800+ chip for notebooks. The
company also announced Monday it has begun shipping MirrorBit, its newest
flash memory product for storing data in cell phones and other devices.  
 **ADVANCED MICRO DEV 9.25 1.65%**

**Microsoft tries to steal Macworld thunder**  
Microsoft on Monday launched the first of several pre-emptive strikes against
Apple Computer's Macworld trade show by making announcements about new
technologies far ahead of their delivery to market. The strategic attack comes
as tensions mount between Apple and Microsoft. During Macworld five years ago,
the two companies announced a five-year technology agreement, whereby
Microsoft committed to continued development of Office and Internet Explorer
for the Mac.

**C.S. First Boston expects an upbeat outlook from Intel in tech notes
7/15/02**  
Analyst Tim Mahon predicts the chip titan will report second-quarter results
in-line with expectations, but offer better-than-expected guidance for the
third quarter. Intel rival AMD's poor quarterly results stemmed more from
company-specific issues than PC market troubles, Mahon says. And he points to
other evidence of PC strength, such as Dell's positive comments about the
current quarter. Mahon also expects Intel to speak confidently about its new
845G chipset, which he suggests could pressure the shares of graphics chip
firms. Mahon reiterates a ""buy"" rating on Intel.

No. 1 data storage machine maker EMC Corp. on Monday said it named an outsider
to its board of directors, bowing to pressure from shareholders who said the
board had too many insiders. EMC said Gail Deegan, the former chief financial
officer of Houghton Mifflin Co., will become the eighth member of its board,
filling a seat left vacant since the fall. Deegan, 55, will also be a member
of the audit committee.

------- Additional Comments From easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu  2002-09-21 16:41 -------
I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -
on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely ""Evolutionary Programming"", since
the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not
crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,
especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the
suspiciously-high ""anti-ratware"" USER_AGENT scores). From past results,
what's needed are one or more of the below:
        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,
           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow
           for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a
           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly
           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the
           ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel;
        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a
           fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or
           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more
           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less
           parameters.

        -Allen

Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.

Now for a razor question:

I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.

Thanks,
Dave

I have a prob when trying to install Linux (tried RedHat, Suse) on my
laptop. I can start the install but after about 2min, the whole pc just
dies.
I know it's not a Linux prob and here is what I have encountered:

I had the same problem when installing Win on it and eventually sorted it
out by disabling the infrared port. I'm guessing this might be same prob
although I'm not sure. I am very new to Linux so it's not that easy for me
to work it out. I did manage to follow the setup procedure at one stage
(using images on disks) and it cuts out either as it's trying to verify what
CD-Rom I have or just after (hence my suspicion of the infrared port again).

can anyone help ?

thanks
Gianni

ATTN: DIRECTOR.
DEAR ,

I wish to extend my greeting to you and your entire
family. I got your contact from the ivoirian chamber
of commerce, I prayed over it and selected your name
among other names because of its esteeming
nature.Morever,after my strong prayers and fasting,
God reveals to me that you are straight forward,
Honest and Gods person.
This is the reason I never waste time to propose you
this business for our mutual benefits. Infact, You
will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand, Believe me.

I am MARTIN FRANCIS, A cote divoire national and the
only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of Cte dIvoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
Cte dIvoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,provided

you cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment
in your country as due to the instruction my father
gave to me before he late. What I require from you are
as follows.

1.Your private telephone and fax number for easy and
strict communication
2.Your bank particular for smooth and successful
remittance of this monies to your nominated account
3.You have to make necessary arrangement for me to
meet with you immediately the monies is been
transferred in your account and confirmed by you.
4.You have to secure a college for me in your country
to further my education. 
5.You will have to be my guardian and part of the
joint venture investment when I get to your country.

Furthermore, my late father had instructed me to offer
20 % of the total sum to the person who is to assist
me out for the transferring of this fund.

Moreover, I wish to assure you that this transaction
would be concluded within the next(3)days you signify
interest to assist me out.I suggest that this
transaction should be handled in strict confidence
because I have work out fine every modalities
concerning the transfer of this fund. 
Please and please, kindly hasten up the arrangement as
quickly as possible because my late father instructed
me not to invest this monies in this country Cte-
dIvoire. That I should invest abroad of my choice for
the benefit of myself and for security reasons.

Thank very much in anticipation of your
acknowledgement of this business proposal and do not
hesitate to contact me immediately you receive this
message with this my direct telephone number mentioned
above, tel : + 225 05775748 for us to proceed

This may be a systematic bias in the testing procedure:  in real life, msgs
come ordered in time.  Say there's a thread that spans N messages on c.l.py.
In our testing setup, we'll train on a random sampling throughout its whole

That's exactly what is intended; the idea is that legit senders who

6-10 messages.

Note that running a single spam through ""spamassassin -a -t"" *will*

Bigfoot Story Teller
(1919-2002)

Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related
events, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State
construction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest
home.

It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray Wallaces
company building a new road through the northern California forest.   In
August through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew
found tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from
taxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called Bigfoot.  Crew
took the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt
County newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant
plaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a
revolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to todays
global awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace
and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;
Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.

Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
of his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace
offered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace
failed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down
through the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake
Sasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.
He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
about this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby
guarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and
researchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through
his contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to
Fate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
Bigfoot mystery.

In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
could bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for
forty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to
adulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with
care and respect and would like to train the creature to ride around with
him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one
came forth with a baby Bigfoot.

Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to
the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,
such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.

Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington
State, on November 30, 2002.

Well, just to take this thread off topic - does anyone know what's

 the only practical alternatives are MS and Real, and that it's likely 
to cost some $$$ for the software.

Mixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. 

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart 
was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive 
ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head 
with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not 
diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general 
artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 
heart). 

Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 
well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 
asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 
it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 
not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 
ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 
angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 
because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part 
of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

Unfortunately, there are few comments in this part of the code.  I haven't  been helping that situation much, although there are some comments in the new  sequence stuff that I wrote.

As Dan said -- it's a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data.

Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can't be
directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.

In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.

Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
into a procmail environment.  Lots of people use it in many other ways.  For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out.  I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).

Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

    :0fw
    | spamassassin -P

    :0
    * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
    $SPAM

Which just says, ""Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
processing stream.  If the resulting mail has a header which begins
""X-Spam-Status: Yes"", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
$SPAM.

SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
about how its tests fared.  I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
of headers which further processing downstream can key on.

RealNetworks Poses Challenge to Microsoft
By JOHN MARKOFF

SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 -- In a significant challenge to Microsoft,
RealNetworks plans to announce a new version of its software on Monday
that can distribute audio and video in a range of formats, including
Microsoft's own proprietary Windows Media.

The new software is intended for large media companies and other
corporations that need to send audio and video data to customers and
employees in a variety of different formats. But RealNetworks
acknowledged that it was possible that the company might incur
Microsoft's legal wrath.

Nevertheless, Rob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive who founded
RealNetworks as Progressive Networks in 1994, said he believed the
strategy was good for both Microsoft and consumers.

""A rational way for them to respond would be to say, `This is great,' ""
he said. ""That would be Microsoft of the future.""

Mr. Glaser said his company, based in Seattle, had developed a version
of the Microsoft Media Server software that comes with the Windows
operating system.

He said RealNetworks' engineers had studied the data that was sent
between the Microsoft media server software and the Windows Media Player
program and recreated the technology needed to play files in the
Microsoft format. This method created a so-called clean-room version,
meaning the developers built the transmission software without any
knowledge about the underlying program.

Microsoft has adopted a similar strategy at several junctures,
Mr. Glaser said, reverse-engineering technologies like NetWare,
PostScript and JavaScript at different times.

Microsoft executives said the company currently licensed the Windows
Media Player technology to a variety of companies including Yahoo,
RealNetworks and the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner. But a
Microsoft executive said that a clean-room copy of the Windows server
technology could lead to quality and performance issues.

""It's kind of hard to speculate about the technology until we see it,""
said Dave Fester, the general manager of the Windows Media division. If
a company has not licensed the server software, he added, ""we would need
to look at it and see what they're doing.""

RealNetworks appears to be endeavoring to avoid being ""Netscaped,"" a
reference to the fate that befell the Netscape Communications
Corporation when Microsoft decided to make an Internet browser, which
was pioneered commercially by Netscape, a standard part of the Windows
operating system. Netscape was later acquired by AOL Time
Warner. Microsoft's decision to build an Internet browser into Windows
and give it away at no additional cost led directly to a bitter
antitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department in 1997.

RealNetworks, which was a pioneer in the market for streaming media to
desktop personal computers, has been under growing pressure from
Microsoft, which is giving away both the server and Windows Media Player
program as part of its operating strategy. RealNetworks also faces
challenges from Apple Computer, which offers the QuickTime media player
as a part of its Macintosh OS X operating system and sells a more
full-featured player.

Moreover, in recent months Macromedia Inc., which makes the Flash
animation software used on many Web sites, has added video capabilities
to its technology, making it a potential rival.

RealNetworks is gambling that with a proliferation of different
standards and formats for video and audio, the media corporations that
make content available over the Internet will flock to a single system
that supports multiple types of data. The company is trying to shift the
focus of the competition from the PC desktop to the server, according to
analysts.

Several analysts said the RealNetworks shift in strategy could put
Microsoft on the defensive.

""Real has got the experience and sophistication to pull this off,"" said
Richard Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a market research and
consulting firm based in Seaford, N.Y. ""It will open up a new horse race.""

Until now the companies have been engaged in a technology war to rapidly
increase the power and quality of each of their media players. At the
same time, they have competed over which of the programs are placed on
the desktops of personal computer users. RealNetworks claims to have
700,000 subscribers for pay services, but it is perceived as being
increasingly vulnerable, according to some analysts, because Microsoft
has included its Media Player as part of the Windows operating system,
which dominates the PC market.

There are dozens of data formats for playing audio and video on the
Internet, but the dominant ones are RealAudio and RealVideo from
RealNetworks, QuickTime from Apple, Windows Media from Microsoft and the
industry digital movie standards MPEG-2 and MPEG-4.

Microsoft and RealNetworks are currently locked in a close race for
desktop media player leadership. In the first quarter of this year,
according to survey data collected by Jupiter Research, a market
research firm based in New York, RealNetworks' RealOne Player had a 29.1
percent share of media players, while Microsoft's Windows Media Player
had a 28.2 percent share. Apple's Quicktime player was third, with a
12.2 percent.

The new server software from RealNetworks is part of a version of the
company's media server that is to be introduced on Monday and which will
be called the Helix Universal Server. RealNetworks said it would offer
performance data based on a test it financed at an independent testing
service, KeyLabs, that indicate that the Helix software can, under some
conditions, deliver up to four times the speed of the Windows Media
Server in Microsoft's operating system. (Software servers are programs
that run on powerful computers and can send streams of digital
information to many computer users simultaneously.)

At a news conference scheduled to be held in San Francisco, RealNetworks
is also expected to announce that it plans to make the Helix software
available as part of a strategy known as community source, which will
make it possible for RealNetworks partners and competitors to take
advantage of the original programmers' instructions.

RealNetworks is to announce a range of partners, including Hitachi,
Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Deutsche Telekom, NEC, Nokia, Cisco Systems,
Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Palm, Texas Instruments and others. These
partners could then incorporate the software into their own hardware and
software products.

Under the licensing strategy, companies will be able to freely gain
access to the underlying code that the Helix program is based on, but
they will still pay a licensing fee when they sell commercial products
based on the technology.

The community-source approach to software, which was pioneered by Sun to
distribute its Java programming language, is a variation upon the
original free software or open-source approach which has confounded the
software industry in recent years.

While open-source software can be freely shared, with some restrictions,
the community-source approach is more restrictive and yet still tries to
persuade others to collaborate and add innovative ideas.

Other large technology companies including Sun, I.B.M. and Apple, have
all now adopted variations on such open-source strategy, with varying
results. In Sun's case, the company has been criticized because, while
Java has become an industry standard, the company has not been the
principal financial beneficiary in many cases.

RealNetworks is trying to strike a balance between opening up its
technology to persuade others to participate and innovate and not losing
control of the technology entirely, Mr. Glaser said. ""We think we've
struck the balance well,"" he said.

Analysts said the strategy shift by RealNetworks was likely to shake up
the industry. ""The moment you've open-sourced something you've cornered
your competitor,"" said Matthew Berk, an analyst a Jupiter Research. ""To
date this stuff has been very proprietary. Opening it up makes it
accessible to creative and gifted programmers who will come up with wild
stuff that the companies have never considered.""

Mr. Glaser said he expected other companies to produce technology that
would rival RealNetworks' commercially as a result of the
community-source strategy.

One possibility is that companies such as Sun or I.B.M. could decide to
add the Helix technology of RealNetworks as a standard component of
their operating systems. Although RealNetworks might not get a
significant financial benefit from such an arrangement it could
contribute to making its Helix software a de facto industry standard.

Mr. Glaser said he had struck upon the idea of making his media server
software open source while visiting with an executive from Nokia, the
world's largest cellphone maker.

""Taking all of this stuff beyond the PC has been a huge motivation for
us,"" he said. When he realized that Nokia was interested in deploying
the software technology on as many as 30 to 40 different types of
phones, he realized that RealNetworks did not have enough programming
talent to support the effort.

""I told him, `I don't think we have enough engineers even if you guys
were willing to pay us,' "" he said.

That touched off a search for an alternative way of having the two
companies cooperate.

Real takes the open-source route 
By Jim Hu 
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
July 22, 2002, 1:55 PM PT

RealNetworks on Monday unveiled a new open-source version of its
streaming media technology that supports multiple file formats for audio
and video, including those that use Microsoft's Windows Media technology. 

The new campaign, dubbed ""Helix,"" and first reported by The New York
Times, marks one of the most ambitious moves in the company's
history. RealNetworks is simultaneously releasing technology without
permission that plugs in to Microsoft's competing software and is
raising the hood on much of its own software technology to ""open source""
developers or anyone else who wants to look. 

The twin moves raise the risk of lawsuits and renewed competition --
potentially even from Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft itself, once it
gets a look under the hood at RealNetworks' technology. But it marks a
dramatic, potential way for a company watching its market share diminish
to regain momentum and support across an industry where many other
players remain skeptical of Microsoft's power.

""It's a very bold move on the part of Real,"" said Michael Gartenberg, a
research director for analyst firm Jupiter Research. ""This was a shot
fired by Real and fired directly at Redmond."" 

The move is the latest in a series of strategic twists and turns that
has made RealNetworks one of the only companies to survive direct
Microsoft competition for years. While the company has expanded into
paid subscription content business, its software and streaming media
infrastructures have been under increasing pressure from Microsoft,
which has deemed multimedia to be one of the major drives under the
latest versions of its Windows operating system. 

Real's Helix announcement mainly involves the technology that allows
media files to move from place to place over the Internet. RealNetworks
and Microsoft both produce servers that allow video and audio to be
streamed from a content company such as CNN or NBC to a personal
computer. Real has charged for this software, while Microsoft has given
it away for free. 

In April, RealMedia reached 17 million at-home viewers, compared with
Windows Media at 15.1 million and Apple Computer's QuickTime at 7.3
million, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. At work, Windows Media drew
about 12.2 million unique viewers, compared with RealMedia's 11.6
million and QuickTime's 5 million. 

Real's own new product, called the Universal Server, will allow one
server to stream Real's technology, Microsoft files, Apple Computer's
QuickTime, and others. Most other competing products do not support
competitors' technology. 

""When you have all these different platforms, and all these different
protocols, it gets unmanageable,"" RealNetworks' Rob Glaser said at a
high-glitz press conference in San Francisco announcing the product. ""A
lot of what (this technology) is about is breaking those bottlenecks and
making convergence really converge."" 

To make the new product compatible with Microsoft files, however, the
company pursued a risky strategy known as ""reverse engineering,"" in
which developers examine a competitor's product to see how it works and
try to create something that works just like it. 

Glaser said that engineers worked entirely in a ""clean room""
environment, meaning that they had no access to actual Microsoft
code. Had they simply copied code, they could be liable for patent
infringement. The resulting product simply mimics the way that
Microsoft's files are sent across networks and allows a Windows Media
player to receive the file. 

Other companies have been sued for simply copying a competitor's code
and putting it in their own products. But RealNetworks says it's not
worried about Microsoft lawsuits, because it took precautions to do all
development in the ""clean room"" environment. Microsoft itself has
engaged in this kind of legal reverse engineering. 

Analysts say Microsoft, which still faces antitrust lawsuits, is in no
position to sue in any case. 

""This is a very tenuous time for Microsoft,"" Gartenberg said. ""This is
not a time in Microsoft's history when it can be seen as trying to do to
Real what it did to Netscape."" 

The influential giant?

Certainly, Monday's announcement acknowledges Microsoft's influence in
media technology, something Glaser and Real have often been loathe to do. 

Microsoft was quick to spin Monday's announcement as further validation
of its strength in the marketplace. 

""It's an admission of RealNetworks that it's important for them to
support Windows Media and that we're now the leading player among home
and work users,"" said Michael Aldridge, lead product manager for
Microsoft's Windows Digital Media division. 

Aldridge added that RealNetworks currently has a licensing agreement for
its media player to support Windows audio and video formats. However,
RealNetworks and Microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server
to deliver Windows Media formats to end users, which is what
RealNetworks trying to do. 

Aldridge declined to comment on RealNetworks' replication of Microsoft's
technology. 

In addition to its own new product, Real has promised to give away
source code to much of the underlying technology for streaming
media. That stops short of the actual file format, or ""codec"" itself,
but will provide the open-source community and other companies with
powerful new tools to build their own streaming media players or
software. 

Glaser said he wouldn't initially make the software code that mimics
Microsoft's streaming available but that he was considering the idea. A
first chunk of code underlying the RealNetworks multimedia player
software will be released in 90 days. Other code, including the basic
functions of its streaming media server and encoder, will be released by
the end of the year, the company said. 

The company's plan to reveal its source code--the basic instructions
underlying the software--echoes similar moves made by Netscape
Communications to defend against Microsoft. In March 1998, Netscape took
the bold step of opening its source code to allow software developers to
help create the next generation of its popular browser. 

James Barksdale, then CEO of Netscape, said the move would allow the
company to ""tap into a virtually unlimited developer talent pool.""
Instead, the effort, which has evolved into the Mozilla.org project, hit
considerable roadblocks, and Microsoft overtook Netscape in market
share.

The problem with SOAP is that it tries to escape from the Web interface.
It deliberately attempts to suck, mostly because it is deliberately
trying to supplant CGI-like applications rather than Web-like
applications.  It is simply a waste of time for folks to say that ""HTTP
allows this because I've seen it used by this common CGI script.""  If we
thought that sucky CGI scripts were the basis for good Web
architectures, then we wouldn't have needed a Gateway Interface to
implement them.  In order for SOAP-ng to succeed as a Web protocol, it
needs to start behaving like it is part of the Web.  That means, among
other things, that it should stop trying to encapsulate all sorts of
actions under an object-specific interface.  It needs to limit its
object-specific behavior to those situations in which object-specific
behavior is actually desirable.  If it does not do so, then it is not
using URI as the basis for resource identification, and therefore it is
no more part of the Web than SMTP.

ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
early 1980s if not before.

A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
adequate.

It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 

BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
recovery
and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
attacks


Hi,

I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.

This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html

Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.

The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.

When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)

Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.

Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

If untrusted strangers are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or something).

ASK THE FOOL

Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? 

A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to 
be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and 
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request.

YOUR MONEY 

RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070

Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 

1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 

2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072

3. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073

4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more 
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074

5. REFINANCE AND SAVE 
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity 
to save big money.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075

If this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it 
alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your 
finances with TMF Money Advisor. In fact, we're so excited about 
this service, we are offering a free one-month trial

SPOTLIGHT

SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. 

We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.

Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center.

COMMUNITY TIPS

DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. 

-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. 

-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 

-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. 

-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.

-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 

-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). 

Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

Yes, it's definitely extra work.  The question is how much extra 
work, both up front, and then on an ongoing basis.  I know 
nothing about how the trust system is working (still waiting for 
that long-promised server code to be published), but now that 
it's been turned on, and the more info that's coming out about 
it, the more concerned I'm becoming that it's extremely easy to 
game; that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent 
is low, and that once it's set up, it can be ""fire and forget"" 
in terms of continuing to operate in a way that's not easy to 
distinguish from real user behavior.

> Sure, you can find a way to work almost any system, but few

> will actually take the time to game the system.

Another concern I have with the way the system might be working 
is that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to 
utterly undermine the whole system.  There are a certain number 
of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive 
to liars, or misclassifiers of ""gray"" mail, or both.  It's not 
clear yet whether this universe is one of those or not.

You do need a certain level of accuracy though, or the filter is 
not economically worthwhile.  If you only filter 75% of spam, 
you're wasting your time.  Some people receive on the order of a 
10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% means the ratio adjusts to 
5:2 which is still shitty.  95% makes it 1:2, which is better.  
99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice.  As the global ratio of 
spam:mail rises, this problem gets somewhat more important.  
With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam:real 
ratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK.  75% effective is 
now really, really shitty.

Time will tell.  Time will also tell how good the system is at 
adjusting over time to gaming strategies.

SA definitely has a non-zero FP rate, and always will have.  I 
would argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, 
including the ""no filter"" filter -- humans make mistakes too 
sometimes!  As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I'm 
fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate.  If 
spammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust 
system, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to replace the trust 
system with something else.

Lots of theorizing, most of it based on little data.  The key 
premises I'm worrying about though are:

1. Trust system is easy to pollute
2. Trust system is not personal, which makes the assumption that 
all honest voters agree on what constitutes spam

Razor2 seems to have been a long time in coming, apparently is 
quite resource intensive (judging by Cloudmark's fundraising 
efforts), and doesn't currently work.  It has great promise, and 
I'm hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it'll add 
another powerful tool in the war on spam -- I'm just concerned 
that it's getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to 
recover.

Shlepy> Aint he the continental one....Speaking of global
politics....Three guys, an Englishman, a Frenchman and an American are out
walking along the beach together one day. They come across a lantern and a
genie pops out of it.  ""I will give you each one wish, "" says the genie.
The American says, ""I am a farmer, my dad was a farmer, and my son will
also farm. I want the land to be forever fertile in America."" With a blink
of the genie's eye, 'FOOM'  -  the land in America was forever made
fertile for farming.  The Frenchman was amazed, so he said, ""I want a wall
around France, so that no one can come into our precious country.""  Again,
with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF'  -  there was a huge wall around
France.  The Englishman asks, ""I'm very curious. Please tell me more about
this wall.  The Genie explains, ""Well, it's about 150 feet high, 50 feet
thick and nothing can get in or out.""  The Englishman says, ""Fill it up
with water.""

Fenchie>Plutt nous devrions nous noyer que mangent la cuisine anglaise.

Shlpey> Them French, you dont know what they are on about but damn it sure
sounds romantic. And you knwo they are great lovers those french are. A
psychology professor decided to study the way in which different people
from different parts of Europe have sex with sheep. He traveled first to
Wales, where he asks a farmer to explain his method: ""Well, boyo, I put
her back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with me velcro gloves,
and we're well away. Tidy!""  The professor tries Scotland next ""Hoots an'
toots man, I put her back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with
me velcro gloves, and we're  well away. Och aye tha noo!""  The professor
moves on to Germany: ""Well, I find the most efficient way is to grab her
with my velcro gloves, and we're well away. The professor is noticing a
pattern developing, so he decides to try France, and then end his
investigation.  He stops a bloke by the Eiffel tower named Pierre, and
asks him to explain the French method: ""Well monsieur, I put her back legs
down my nice green wellies, sling her front legs over me shoulders, and
that's all there is to it!"" The professor is excited to have found some
national variation and tells Pierre that this is different to the methods
of the Scots, Welsh and Germans. ""How do they do it then?"" asks Pierre,
and the professor explains. Pierre on hearing the explanation walks of
disgusted. ""What! No kissing?""

Frenchie>Voil. J'ai stopp.

Sure!  I think it's relevant, but maybe for another purpose.

I am Edward Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through her private search.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of

However, it is conceivable and even logical that NOT ALL OF THE FORTUNE HAS BEEN ""DISCOVERED"" OR FROZEN BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS IN SYMPATHY AND ON THE REQUEST OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA.

15 seconds is more than enough timeout... There's no request/minute limit,
and we are not close to hardware limits on any of the servers.

Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is showing up, right? Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which, as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker: ""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...) But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um, lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist congregation is about as orthogonal to my present congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in. I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing with them. :-). Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal. I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was just looking to make friends as I was new in town. The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a room... That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age, looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women. You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics - -- but I won't go there, I promise. If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...

You're a good bunch, you Penguins.

Today's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you
a quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik
has found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With
Diabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But,
with the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost
irrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively
offered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work
for the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to
effect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little
callous about the 'Net ...

Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing
part of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can
further put our technical skills (be they Linux _or_ Windows skills) to work
for a good cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort,
based in the Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services
to worthwhile charitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly
describes our purpose. Next, we need volunteers with the time and ability to
lend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to
the charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or, maybe
the organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain can
use some hands-on or remote volunteer help.

I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the
Aicardi Syndrome Foundation. Though I don't currently know their technical
needs, I do know that the syndrome is very rare - read ""research and technical
dollars are minimal."" I'm sure we can, as a group, provide them a way to fill
existing technical holes.

That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make
others.

Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging
program, GeekLog to pull together a community project area where interested
parties can gather, coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become.
I'll keep you posted on the details.

In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor
Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their
protection from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into
the water, all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the
community.

Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?

**Quick Shortcuts**

Linux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way
you use your system. Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in
shortcuts you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to
change your system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips
that are quick and very easy to learn and remember.

Got a cluttered console screen? Use **[ctrl]+l** to clear it. This does the
same thing as the **clear** command with far fewer keystrokes.

Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the **[ctrl+d** key
combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the
current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal
window, as well.

To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can
avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then
I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings
using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's
substantial.

Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about.

**Kernel Configuration - Part XI**

We've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel
configuration series. Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss
configuring block devices in your kernel.

We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell
issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and
character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data.
Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of
data ""blocks."" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of
data to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly.
Data intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your
power dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating
data up to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.

Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in ""streams,"" one character
at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle
data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer _then_
committing the data.

The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining
why they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to
store or retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of
the disc surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know
where there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the
disc under the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related
data together.

Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and
forget about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and
physical. The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm
Pilot. The storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a
physical storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive
and account for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also
send a signal back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an
indication that character devices often communicate in both directions, as
well.

So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the
system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a
predetermined level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical
properties of the hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest
level view of the process, it still shows how difficult a process physical
data storage really is.

In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data
storage. When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about
your existing hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you
using? What's the interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the
drive located - on the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because
the variables are so broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock
configuration tip that will work for your personal machine every time. I can
tell you this - you will have block devices (normally a hard drive and a
floppy), and you need to answer as many of the above questions as you can.
Find out as much about these physical devices as you can, and the
configuration process will be relatively painless.

A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series
continues to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration
recommendations where possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make
such recommendations. However, where the variable set is as broad as block
devices, much of the legwork will be up to you.

Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.

Servers, also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the
configuration and software from a master server. No administration is done
directly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers. When
the rxnode has finished booting up and all software is running, it is

The turnaround is distinct since P2P has distanced itself from the darling days of Napster and has been transplanted onto the architectural drawing boards of Internet and corporate network gurus. For network executives, the about-face is showing up in such discrete places as wireless routing, identity management, Web services and grid computing. P2P has proved its worth - albeit with a few warts - in enterprise collaboration and content management applications, but its brightest future may be in the plumbing of corporate distributed computing.   But even as P2P fades into the background, questions around security, standards and quality of service still have to be answered before P2P can flourish, experts say. The P2P evolution Regardless, P2P's evolution has hit its next stage.  ""Peer-to-peer is an architecture and one that will play a substantial role in distributed computing as endpoints in the network gain more power,"" says Jamie Lewis, CEO and research chair of Burton Group. He says that will be particularly important for Web services as peers share processes and data. ""P2P will become a fundamental part of how distributed computing evolves across the Internet and how enterprises build distributed systems internally.""  Lewis says the Internet today is very rudimentary with its basic protocols for basic operations. ""Now we're seriously talking about the network becoming the computer, incorporating some P2P connections and being able to share processes and power, which is what grid computing provides."" Observers say it's a renaissance. ""P2P's reverting to an architecture that can be applied to solve problems that by their very nature are distributed,"" says Neil Macehiter, senior consultant for Ovum, a research and consulting firm. ""But the question is can this model provide benefits for business use."" Macehiter says it can, but he cautions that security, such as removing blocks to P2P traffic on corporate firewalls, is still a major inhibitor to acceptance.  ""But you can imagine something like grid extending to share application logic instead of just being a data grid or a storage grid. When you look at Web services sharing business logic in the enterprise, you see the intersection with grid and P2P,"" he says. Working together To underscore P2P's evolution, the Global Grid Forum (GGF), a 2-year-old group founded by academics and researches, merged in April with the P2P Working Group, originally founded by Intel. The groups are attempting to marry the GGF's work on harnessing servers on a grid with P2P's ability to connect desktops. ""We're now trying to figure out how grid and P2P play nice together, and capture that power for use in enterprise computing,"" says Andrew Chien, co-director of the GGF's peer-to-peer area and CTO of Entropia, a provider of desktop grid applications. Late last month, the merged group began evaluating how P2P relates to the Open Grid Services Architecture, an effort to standardize grid computing. Chien says his group is exploring how P2P protocols for such things as registration, resource discovery and coordination of data transfer support a common grid infrastructure. And P2P's roots are reaching into other areas. It is an integral part of mobile wireless technology set for release this fall by MeshNetworks. The company's MeshLAN software extends the range of 802.11 wireless networks by making every wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc P2P network and also a router/repeater to channel traffic to other peers. Using a patented multihopping technology, peers that are out of range of wireless access points or peers they wish to communicate with can hop through other peers to reach their destination, including corporate LANs. It not only increases the wireless range, it preserves throughput, which is up to 6 megabits. The technology also is mobile, letting hopping take place from nodes traveling in vehicles up to 250 mph. ""P2P allows us to do the hopping, and our algorithms allow the traffic to pick the most efficient path to travel,"" says Rick Rotondo, vice president of disruptive technologies for MeshNetworks. ""The beauty of a P2P network is that it is self-forming and self-healing."" And the technology is mature.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which created the Internet, spent $150 million developing the peer technology for use in forming instant networks among soldiers on a battlefield. MeshNetworks licensed it from DARPA has spent an additional $27 million to create a commercial product. P2P also is key to the PingID Project to create an identity management system similar to work under way by Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance Project, which are not using P2P.  ""Ideally, you need a way to create, manage and exchange digital identity information with no one in the middle of the transaction,"" says Andre Duran, founder of the project. He says that's P2P, but it's just one part of the equation.  ""Your ID is a virtual private vault with different drawers,"" Duran says. ""One drawer may be on your PC, one may be with a service provider, and you need a client to manage all that. We are building the infrastructure to support that."" Ping ID is working on server and client software that acts like a mini-Web server and maintains a repository of user's identity information. Users have the option of exchanging IDs directly through P2P or using client/server technology to authorize a third party to dispense their identity data.  ""P2P provides a level of control that other architectures don't,"" Duran says. ""It comes down to the fact that some applications are more efficient with P2P."" That is the concept that is driving P2P into so many different areas of computing. ""P2P has evolved from something highly disruptive to something complementary to intranets, extranets, mobile users and all the Web integration,"" says Greg Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology, which develops a P2P collaboration software called Magi. And although P2P is still settling into this new role, it's obvious that its reputation as a music-swapping corporate scourge are now well behind it. 					   Copyright 2001 Network World, Inc.

Nope, can't say that I had any problems installing SuSE 8.0. Just stuck in

I think any changes that make it behave more intuitively are a good thing even  if they mean we have something else to fix.  Of course, that attitude is why  I've been fixing exmh bugs for 3 weeks.

Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption

Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
intercourse.
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

How about enabling the ""Show unseen message count in folder cache""
option? It displays the number of unseen messages next to each folder name
(if greater than 0), so you don't really need the unseen window unless
you're using more sequences than just ""unseen"".

Interesting. I've always wondered about things 'considered' to be bad.  Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?

Yeah yeah yeah. I tried it (over a year ago) and it sucked like a new vacuum
cleaner. Although I expect that it will be a lot better by now. What I would
really like to see is Gnome on one of the Sun Ray thin terminals.

Er, I mean normal fashion for a Linux install. This would be distro
specific, anyway.

I am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script
changes. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.

I do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are
picked up by silo. So:
  boot disk linux

would not prompt for selection but would boot straight through. From there
it is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the install would be
automatic from there on.

The problem is that the time between linux booting and when the console tty
drivers are started can be a black hole, without error messages or log in
prompts. The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM
on shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or
keyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power
switch hidden at the back of the case.

I think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is
/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down
properly.

act.DTL

Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.

....

To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.

--------

I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.

One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not secret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark. Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise. At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours.

Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00

So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her 
company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a 
tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 
remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that 
reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be 
honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind 
that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the 
tilde. 

Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home 
directory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username 
will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to 
their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can 
trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal 
pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to 
have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more 
commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html 
subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point 
your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files 
from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. 

But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. 

As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in 
this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (
old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene 
Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a 
tilde. 

In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 
used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a 
tilde in its URL. 

Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. 

Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn 
that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd 
character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if 
indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, 
to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. 
The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; 
(now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along 
the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky 
uses. 

Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 
#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came 
even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 
1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee 
meeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease 
SHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or 
what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, 
when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. 

And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of 
yesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google 
Groups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William 
Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially 
pronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary
[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was 
cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 
ASCII characters. 

As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
[11]. 

In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. 

In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 
Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. 

As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. 

As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. 

In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements 
(history,tilde,job control)[16]. 

As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed 
in the APL-11 character set[18]. 

In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying 
bugs in csh). 

In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting 
this typographical pun[21]. 

And that's the earliest reference I can find. 

So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but 
there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the 
tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for 
&#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers 
to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 
sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 
my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. 
May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.

OK, here's a refinement.  Assuming very little spam comes through, we
only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
ham to match the new training spam.  The program could randomly select
a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to
validate this selection.  You could do this once a day or week (config
parameter).

I'm trying to think about the end-user issues because I have nothing
to contribute to the algorithm at this point.  For deployment we need
both!

Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended up taking a very different route: TMDA (http://www.tmda.net).  In particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to the messages I send to specific lists. For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:  to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda which rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question is able to send mail to). 				  -+- Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.   Reasons:   nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on   a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls   getservbyname() which does a lookup against ""smtp"" in /etc/services).   Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead   of SMTP.   Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not   recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail   delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use   sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:     .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv   which creates problems:     Postfix does not support ""-bv"" and returns in error     Exim does not support ""-t"" with ""-bv"" and returns in error     Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.   ""whom"" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.       It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout     about this.  The ""-bv"" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to     being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.     Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a     non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's     current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in     /etc/services) is a pain. I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's ""whom"" support using Exim's system filter:   0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:     DATADIR     ALLOW_MODE_640     CRYPT_KEY_FILE     FINGERPRINT   1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group ""mail"".   2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.   3) Set the following options in exim.conf:     message_filter = ""/etc/exim/filter""     message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe   4) /etc/exim/filter reads:     # Exim filter     testprint ""local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}""     testprint ""domain: ${domain: $h_From:}""     if ""$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:"" is """" and         ""${domain: $h_From:}"" is ""kanga.nu"" and        ""${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}"" is ""true""     then       pipe ""/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config""       finish     endif   Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that   they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for   your setup. Basic explanation:   Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is   configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter   extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru   that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.   The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement   for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different   user, chgrp as appropriate.   It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I   haven't investigated that end. Notes:   This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA   has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),   and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If   you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for   other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so   don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if   you wish.   A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail   servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA   support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less   complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA   configuration. Caveat Emptor.     ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a   ""hold"" delivery method (identical to ""confirm"" except it sends no   confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing   silent sidetracking of mail). --  J C Lawrence                 ---------(*)                Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas.  claw@kanga.nu               He lived as a devil, eh?		   http://www.kanga.nu/~claw/  Evil is a name of a foeman, as I live. _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users",0,1

There is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous

sound.  It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I'm a little
more suspicious of very high upward revisions.

At least that was my take.

Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
Outlook.

When we get more (good) ""nice"" tests, the GA will assign lower
scores to them.  I think the current problem is that there are
very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
problem to solve.

Aye, but it'll still need a /boot/kickstart/$VER/$IP-kickstart won't it

I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so: NEW: exmh.Exmh NAME: exmh CLASS: Exmh NEW: unseen.UnseenWin NAME: unseen CLASS: UnseenWin BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE 	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when shading.) 	Hmm. Weird.

that puts it into my test corpus.

Or alternately, whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer.

My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes) pickle.  hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you write stuff out to a dbm file.  With that same message base, the dbm file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.  It also takes longer to write:   Using a database:    real    8m24.741s    user    6m19.410s    sys     1m33.650s   Using a pickle:    real    1m39.824s    user    1m36.400s    sys     0m2.160s This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says). For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at least for speed) on the same data blazes along:    real    0m29.592s    user    0m28.050s    sys     0m1.180s Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB. However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be able to outperform it.  It's something to keep in mind, though. I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, I do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;)  In any case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.   On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking down to 1.8MB. Neale",0,0

Well, yesterday I went for my 30-day post op review (it was actually 38 days
after I was discharged) and there was good news and bad news. The good news is
that I'm healing quickly. My body is very strong and doing really well. My
blood pressure is great. Heart rate is great. Cholesterol needs work and I
have to lose a bunch of weight, and of course I can't smoke. Now the bad news.
I have to be a saint for the rest of my life. I knew this day was coming. As I
start to feel better, I want to relax. That ain't going to happen. Oy. Here's
my old theme song. ""Don't ask me to be Mister Clean, cause baby I don't know

![A picture named
bryanHoch.gif](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/images/2002/07/30/bryanHoch.gif)Thanks
to Glenn Reynolds for the link to metsonline.net. As a Mets fan since 1962, I
think it's great that sites like this exist and are flourishing. Like Bryan
Hoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there
isn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I
totally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money.
The site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major
League Baseball. If you go deeper you see that Hoch contributed his time for
free to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over
by MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves
based on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another
side to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please
remember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this
website is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing.

James Raftery <james-iiu@now.ie>,iiu@taint.org,"Fri, 19 Jul 2002 14:59:18 +0100",[IIU] IE nameserver problems,"Hi,

Four of the IE nameservers are publishing out of date DNS information.
The four listed below are publishing the IE zone from last Friday.
They are six days behind reality.

 192.16.202.11    NS.EU.NET.
 192.93.0.4       NS2.NIC.FR.
 198.133.199.102  GNS1.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.
 198.133.199.103  GNS2.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.

The upshot of this is that correct DNS resolution for IE DNS data that
has been added or updated since last Friday is going to be 
intermittant. If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five
nameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five
out of nine aren't good odds.

Don't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache
the bad data for up to two days.

If you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add

	blackhole {
		192.16.202.11;
		192.93.0.4;
		198.133.199.102;
		198.133.199.103;
	};

to your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers.
This will prevent _any_ queries to those servers.

Putting

	16.1.0.18
	204.123.2.18
	16.1.0.19
	192.111.39.100
	212.17.32.2
	193.1.142.2

in /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will
have the same result for dnscache users.

Sending mail directly to a backup mail server in the hopes that it has

Sigh.

This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity of
female monkeys with males other than the alpha male, i.e, specifically
not the tail end of the distribution.  ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure [etc.]""

This has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.

So I chose not to type ""on average"" explicitly in my post, since this
is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.


There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested
in typical behaviour and you in extreme.  Actually, you probably just

	I've been thinking about this sort of thing
	lately, and how the technological realization
	of these issues is one that enforces *absolute*
	control of content, where the original legal
	strictures (copyright) only enforced a limited

	What I'm wondering is this:  if you give
	people absolute control of copyright, whose
	works will be around in 100 years?  Because
	I'm starting to think that the content
	creator who wants to produce for posterity
	had better do it in such a way that the
	content is *not* ""protected"", or the content
	will be inaccessible to people in 15 years,
	much less 100.

	This of course assumes that the content
	control mechanisms aren't so pervasive that
	one *cannot* create content without going
	through controlled channels.

Yes, you read the links.

Sorry, but exposing folly is not only humorous but also instructive.  It
is only by exposing folly to ridicule that you stop it in the first
place.

'Brickbats' leans heavily on both, though the item I highlighted was a
'horror' item not a 'gee that is stupid' item.  For an example of the
latter, see the city that wanted a woman to pay a ticket for parking in
an UNmarked no-parking space.

Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, and possibly not even
that.  For the most part, people become wealthy by not being stupid.  I
always thought ""not being stupid (most of the time)"" was a fairly low
bar, but apparently most people can't even manage that.

That is really what it all boils down to:  There are lots of ignorant
and/or stupid people who are quite happy to stay that way, and it is a
key causal factor in why things are the way they are.  What are you
going to do about it?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. 
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

Just a big *thank you* to Chris for being willing to dive in and get
very messy.  The sequence management code is some of the very oldest
in exmh, and surely suffered as features were added over several years.
When this stabilizes, it will be a great excuse for a 2.6 release.

It's quite a bit more than natural selection; the times had a fascinating article a few months back (possibly posted as bits here) that note that one Holstein bull who died in the 70s is paternally related to something like 40% of the world's cattle. That's way, way more than natural selection, and (given the difficulty and expense of isolating specific genes for size, industrial-living-ness, etc.) more expansive than raw gene manipulation will be for some time.

IANAEE, but doesn't that count as diversity?

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live.  It is
part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  

For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their
protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

Pop3-servers seem to expect a blank line before ""From ""-lines to seperate mails in a mailbox-file. Spamassassin does not add such a blank line before mails delivered directly to mailbox. Result is that the pop3-server (tested with qpopper4 and cucipop) delivers some mails glued together. I think the solution is to write a blank line to the mailbox befor spamassassin adds the filtered mail.

Try www.hosting365.ie - they haven't let me down yet.

You could try iewebs.com aswell, though I don't know if they do ""just hosting"".

The New York Times and Los Angeles Times both lead with word that
a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest
national gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas
from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01.
The judge concluded that El Paso left 21 percent of its capacity
in the state off-line, thus driving up the price of gas and
helping to induce rolling blackouts. 

and this is the product of overregulation?

Subject: liberal defnitions


Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.

As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.

Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.

And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.

Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
there, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
proper focus set.

I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

I didn't mind the ads. The problem is that the ad
server Opera puts on your machine is a PIG. Every
time it goes to change the ad, it thrashes my
laptop for thirty seconds. So no, I don't mind
the ad, but I do mind that serving ads cripples
the browser.

Alas, Mozilla is also a PIG. So I'm back to using
IE, which seems to be the only free, reasonably
featured browser that runs decently on my laptop.
I'm open to alternatives ..

why?

or more specifically, what do you mean?  on one hand you can optimise
how gcc is compiled.  all that will do is make it generate the exact
same code just a smidge faster.  and since gcc is such a memory pig,
you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep
gcc's heap out of swap.

on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's code
generation.  um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck. i can't
express that enough.  compilers should just work.  perfectly. always.
doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane. they're
hard to trace and you'd better have a deep knowledge of what's going on
to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it yourself.
plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes to get large
speed boosts on x86 chips.

I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two,  then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes. course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham.  Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.

1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
   folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
   hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
   characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

RE: BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

I have decided to contact your assistance in relation to the following business proposal, having obtained your contact through the commercial attach of your country's embassy in South Africa. This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January   during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president's personal security vault and some of his savings.

Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila's national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila's assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father's regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K!
. And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri!
bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. 

Thanks and remain blessed.

I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around --
since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple.

An easy thing is to start the same way:  move all the files into a single
directory.  Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.
Then it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into
N other directories accordingly.

Senate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill
By Roy Mark

The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to
promote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act
would create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is
co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).

The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would
support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective
education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers
and professionals.

""The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step
forward for this very small technology,"" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to
full Senate passage before the end of the year, said. ""Nowhere in the world
are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of
nanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to
lead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide
the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate
new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will
ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.""

The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology
program under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also
create a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National
Nanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and
technical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.

""My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to
change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer
revolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will
mine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" Wyden said in introducing the
bill. ""At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a
half-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various
nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader
in this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to
achieving that goal.

To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for
Societal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to
Nanotechnology would also be established.

According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the
National Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the
National Nanotechnology Initiative in June.

Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;
emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and
short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,
equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research
that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting
interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology
transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal
implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,
educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for
measuring progress toward program goals.",0,1

Lucas Gonze <lgonze@panix.com>,,"Fri, 6 Sep 2002 10:14:00 -0400 (EDT)",Re: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...),"Related anecdote:

I was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  
The only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language 
newspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  
Eventually his story came out.

He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  
after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left
him, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,
asking random asians for help finding her.

I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that
the possibility of mutual exploitation is high.

Anecdote number two:

In college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked with
who was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Among
other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like
offering them flowers.

I asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who
wasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a
mail order bride.

I was really moved.  The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much
as anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.",0,0

I think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database
is key to decentralization. 

Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.
Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency
  by have some play with time and value
Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's
  called congnitive dissonance theory
Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale
  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.

I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.
decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround
from technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way
inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by 
protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. 
The local information when combined with the technical
troubles of providing ""just enough"" forced synchronization
to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.
enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when
concerns are more immedidate.  

Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how
people cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily
pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck
who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the
whole world would be a little more perfect and everything,
including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently
be in its proper place.

Dear Garrison,

There are at least six plans about what to do with
""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial
surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,
children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such
as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works
would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.
What do you think should done with the space?

Joe Adams
Hillsdale, New Jersey

I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan
that's designed by committee and that's gone through
public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold
and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more
public space that the public hates, of which there are
plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city
and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young
ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the
towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic
events occurred in New York that in any other city would
be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and
historical museums and in New York there's barely a
little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.
It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for
their big chance, and compared to that spirit of
entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a
statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's
Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President
Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb
and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all
the things that New York is about. If you want to find
Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New
York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial
city. New York is for the young and lively.",0,1

In the Beginning ...

July 23, 2002
By DENNIS OVERBYE 




 

It has always been easy to make fun of cosmologists,
confined to a dust mote lost in space, pronouncing judgment
on the fate of the universe or the behavior of galaxies
billions of light-years away, with only a few scraps of
light as evidence. 

""Cosmologists are often wrong,"" the Russian physicist Lev
Landau put it, ""but never in doubt."" 

For most of the 20th century, cosmology seemed less a
science than a religious war over, say, whether the
universe had a beginning, in a fiery Big Bang billions of
years ago, or whether it exists eternally in the so-called
Steady State. 



In the last few years, however, a funny thing has happened.
Cosmologists are beginning to agree with one another.
Blessed with new instruments like the Hubble Space
Telescope and other space-based observatories, a new
generation of their giant cousins on the ground and
ever-faster computer networks, cosmology is entering ""a
golden age"" in which data are finally outrunning
speculation. 

""The rate at which we are learning and discovering new
things is just extraordinary,"" said Dr. Charles Bennett, an
astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md. 

As a result, cosmologists are beginning to converge on what
they call a ""standard model"" of the universe that is
towering in its ambition. It purports to trace, at least in
broad strokes, cosmic history from the millisecond after
time began, when the universe was a boiling stew of energy
and subatomic particles, through the formation of atoms,
stars, galaxies and planets to the vast, dilute, dark
future in which all of these will have died. 

The universe, the cosmologists say, was born 14 billion
years ago in the Big Bang. Most of its material remains
resides in huge clouds of invisible so-called dark matter,
perhaps elementary particles left over from the primordial
explosion and not yet identified. 

Within these invisible clouds, the glittery lights in the
sky that have defined creation for generations of humans
are swamped, like flecks of foam on a rolling sea. A good
case can be made, scientists now agree, that the universe
will go on expanding forever. 

In fact, recent observations have suggested that the
expansion of the universe is speeding up over cosmic time,
under the influence of a ""dark energy"" even more mysterious
than dark matter. 

Recently, a group of astronomers led by Dr. William
Percival at the University of Edinburgh combined data from
a variety of observations to compile, based on the simplest
theoretical model, what they say is the most precise
enumeration yet of the parameters that cosmologists have
been fighting about for all these decades. 

The universe, they calculated, is 13.89 billion years old,
plus or minus half a billion years. Only 4.8 percent of it
is made of ordinary matter. Matter of all types, known and
unknown, luminous and dark, accounts for just 27.5 percent.
The rest of creation, 72.5 percent, is the mysterious dark
energy, they reported in a paper submitted last month to
The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 

It is a picture that in some ways is surprisingly simple,
satisfying long-held theoretical prejudices about how the
universe should be designed. Continued agreement with
coming experiments may mean that science is approaching the
end of a ""great program"" of cosmological tests that began
in the 1930's, Dr. P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton and Dr.
Bharat Ratra of Kansas State University said in the draft
of a coming article for The Reviews of Modern Physics. 

In other ways this new dark universe is utterly baffling, a
road map to new mysteries. Dr. Marc Davis, a cosmologist at
the University of California at Berkeley, called it ""a
universe chock full of exotics that don't make sense to
anybody."" 

Moreover there are some questions that scientists still do
not know how to ask, let alone answer, scientifically. Was
there anything before the Big Bang? Is there a role for
life in the cosmos? Why is there something rather than
nothing at all? Will we ever know? 

""We know much, but we still understand very little,"" said
Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of
Chicago. 

The Big Question 

Expanding Forever, 
Or Big Crunch? 

The dim caves of Lascaux, the plains of
Stonehenge and the dreamtime tales of Australian aborigines
all testify to the need to explain the world and existence.
This quest took its present form in 1917. That was when
Albert Einstein took his new general theory of relativity,
which explained how matter and energy warp space-time to
produce gravity, and applied it to the universe. 

Einstein discovered that the cosmos as his theory described
it would be unstable, prone to collapse under its own
gravity. Astronomers, however, were sure that the universe
was stable. So Einstein added a fudge factor that he called
the cosmological constant to his equations. It acted as a
long-range repulsive force to counterbalance gravity. 

In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the
universe was expanding. The sky was full of distant
galaxies all rushing away from us and one another, as if
propelled by what the British astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle
later called derisively a ""big bang."" The universe was not
stable and, thus, did not require counterbalancing.
Einstein abandoned his constant, referring to it as his
biggest blunder. But it would return to haunt cosmologists,
and the universe. 

Hoyle's term stuck, and the notion of an explosive genesis
became orthodoxy in 1965, when Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr.
Robert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories,
discovered a faint uniform radio glow that pervaded the
sky. It was, cosmologists concluded, the fading remnant of
the primordial fireball itself. 

Relieved of their fudge factor, the equations describing
Einstein's universe were simple. Dr. Allan Sandage, the
Carnegie Observatories astronomer, once called cosmology
""the search for two numbers"" - one, the Hubble constant,
telling how fast the universe is expanding, and the other
telling how fast the expansion is slowing, and thus whether
the universe will expand forever or not. 

The second number, known as the deceleration parameter,
indicated how much the cosmos had been warped by the
density of its contents. In a high-density universe, space
would be curved around on itself like a ball. Such a
universe would eventually stop expanding and fall back
together in a big crunch that would extinguish space and
time, as well as the galaxies and stars that inhabit them.
A low-density universe, on the other hand, would have an
opposite or ""open"" curvature like a saddle, harder to
envision, and would expand forever. 

In between with no overall warpage at all was a
""Goldilocks"" universe with just the right density to expand
forever but more and more slowly, so that after an infinite
time it would coast to a stop. This was a ""flat"" universe
in the cosmological parlance, and to many theorists the
simplest and most mathematically beautiful solution of all.


But the sky did not yield those cosmic numbers easily, even
with the help of the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar
Mountain in Southern California, dedicated in 1948, which
had been built largely for that task. Dr. Hubble wrote of
measuring shadows and searching ""among ghostly errors of
measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more
substantial."" 

The Dark Side 

Invisible Matter 
Molds Galaxies 


It was not till the mid-70's, a
quarter-century after the Palomar giant began operating,
that groups of astronomers reached the tentative conclusion
that the universe they could see - stars, gas, planets and
galaxies - did not have nearly enough gravitational oomph
to stop the cosmic expansion. 

""So the universe will continue to expand forever and
galaxies will get farther and farther apart, and things
will just die,"" Dr. Sandage said at the time. 

But the Great Argument was just beginning. Apparently there
was a lot of the universe that astronomers could not see.
The stars and galaxies, were moving as if immersed in the
gravity of giant invisible clouds of so-called dark matter
- ""missing matter"" the Swiss astronomer Dr. Fritz Zwicky
labeled it in the 1930's. 

Many galaxies, for example, are rotating so fast that they
would fly apart unless they were being reined in by the
gravity of halos of dark matter, according to pioneering
observations by Dr. Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington and her colleagues. Her measurements
indicated that these dark halos outweighed the visible
galaxies themselves from 5 to 10 times. But there could be
even more dark matter farther out in space, perhaps enough
to stop the expansion of the universe, eventually, some
theorists suggested. Luminous matter, the Darth Vaders of
the sky said, is like the snow on mountaintops. 

But what is the dark matter? While some of it is gas or
dark dim objects like stars and planets, cosmologists
speculate that most of it is subatomic particles left over
from the Big Bang. 

Many varieties of these particles are predicted by theories
of high-energy physics. But their existence has not been
confirmed or detected in particle accelerators. 

""We theorists can invent all sorts of garbage to fill the
universe,"" Dr. Sheldon Glashow, a Harvard physicist and
Nobel laureate, told a gathering on dark matter in 1981. 

Collectively known as WIMP's, for weakly interacting
massive particles, such particles would not respond to
electromagnetism, the force responsible for light, and thus
would be unable to radiate or reflect light. They would
also be relatively slow-moving, or ""cold"" in physics
jargon, and thus also go by the name of cold dark matter. 

As Earth in its travels passed through the dark-matter
cloud that presumably envelops the Milky Way, the particles
would shoot through our bodies, rarely leaving a trace,
like moonlight through a window. 

But the collective gravity of such particles, cosmologists
say, would shape the cosmos and its contents. 

Gathering along the fault lines laid down by random
perturbations of density in the early universe, dark matter
would congeal into clouds with about the mass of 100,000
Suns. The ordinary matter that was mixed in with it would
cool and fall to the centers of the clouds and light up as
stars. 

The clouds would then attract other clouds. Through a
series of mergers over billions of years, smaller clouds
would assemble into galaxies, and the galaxies would then
assemble themselves into clusters of thousands of galaxies,
and so forth. 

Using the Hubble and other telescopes as time machines -
light travels at a finite speed, so the farther out
astronomers look the farther back in time they see -
cosmologists have begun to confirm that the universe did
assemble itself from the ""bottom up,"" as the dark matter
model predicts. 

Last year, two teams of astronomers reported seeing the
first stars burning their way out of the cloudy aftermath
of the Big Bang, when the universe was only 900 million
years old. The bulk of galaxy formation occurred when the
universe was a half to a quarter its present age,
cosmologists say. 

""The big news in the last decade is that even half a
universe ago the universe looked pretty different,"" said
Dr. Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in
Pasadena. Galaxies before then were small and irregular,
with no sign of the majestic spiral spider webs that
decorate the sky today. 

We would barely recognize our own Milky Way galaxy, if we
could see it five billion years ago when the Sun formed, he
said. 

""By eight billion years back, it would be unrecognizable,""
said Dr. Dressler. 

Yet there are still many questions that the cold dark
matter model does not answer. Astronomers still do not
know, for example, how the first stars formed or why the
models of dark matter distribution don't quite fit in the
cores of some kinds of galaxies. Nor have the dark matter
particles themselves been unambiguously detected or
identified, despite continuing experiments. 

Some astronomers suggest that the discrepancies stem from
the inability of simple mathematical models to deal with
messy details of the real world. 

""It's a huge mystery exactly how stars form,"" Dr. Richard
Bond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics
said. ""We can't solve it now. So it's even harder to try to
solve them back then."" 

But others, notably Dr. Mordehai Milgrom, a theorist at the
Weizmann Institute in Israel, have suggested that modifying
the gravitational laws by which dark matter was deduced in
the first place would alleviate the need for dark matter
altogether. 

The Bang's Fuel 

Inflating One Ounce 
To a Whole Universe 


Clues to what had actually exploded
in the Big Bang emerged as an unexpected gift from another
great scientific quest: physicists' pursuit for a so-called
theory of everything that would unite all physical
phenomena in a single equation. Unable to build machines
powerful enough to test their most ambitious notions on
Earth, some theorists turned to the sky. 

""The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator,"" Dr.
Jakob Zeldovich, an influential Russian cosmologist, said. 

Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world
today - gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak
nuclear forces. But they suspect, based on data from
particle accelerators and high-powered theory, that those
are simply different manifestations of a single unified
force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
moments. 

As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was
a fall from grace, and the laws of physics evolved, with
one force after another ""freezing out,"" or splitting away. 

In 1979, Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, realized that a hypothesized glitch in this
process would have had drastic consequences for the
universe. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can
stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
freeze, releasing latent heat in the process. Similarly,
the universe could ""supercool"" and stay in a unified state
too long. In that case, space itself would become
temporarily imbued with a mysterious kind of latent heat,
or energy. 

Inserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would
act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow
itself apart, Dr. Guth discovered in a calculation in 1979.


In far less than the blink of an eye, 10-37 second, a speck
much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size
of a grapefruit and then resumed its more stately
expansion, with all of normal cosmic history before it,
resulting in today's observable universe - a patch of sky
and stars 14 billion light-years across. All, by the
magical-seeming logic of Einstein's equations, from about
an ounce of primordial stuff. 

""The universe,"" Dr. Guth liked to say, ""might be the
ultimate free lunch."" 

Dr. Guth called his theory inflation. Inflation, as Dr.
Guth pointed out, explains why the universe is expanding.
Dr. Turner of the University of Chicago referred to it as
""the dynamite behind the Big Bang."" 

As modified and improved by Dr. Andrei Linde, now at
Stanford, and by Dr. Paul Steinhardt, now at Princeton and
Dr. Andreas Albrecht now at the University of California at
Davis, inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology ever
since. One of its great virtues, cosmologists say, is that
inflation explains the origin of galaxies, the main
citizens of the cosmos. The answer comes from the
paradoxical-sounding quantum rules that govern subatomic
affairs. On the smallest scales, according to quantum
theory, nature is lumpy, emitting even energy in little
bits and subject to an irreducible randomness. As a result,
so-called quantum fluctuations would leave faint lumps in
the early universe. These would serve as the gravitational
seeds for future galaxies and other cosmic structures. 

As a result of such successes, cosmologists have stuck with
the idea of inflation, even though, lacking the ability to
test their theories at the high energies of the Big Bang,
they have no precise theory about what might have actually
caused it. ""Inflation is actually a class of theories,""
said Dr. Guth. 

In the latest version, called ""chaotic inflation,"" Dr.
Linde has argued that quantum fluctuations in a myriad of
theorized force fields could have done the trick. 

Indeed, he and others now say they believe that inflation
can occur over and over, spawning an endless chain of
universes out of one another, like bubbles within bubbles. 

""The universe inflates on top of itself,"" Dr. Linde told a
physics conference this spring in Princeton. ""It's
happening right now."" 

The Golden Age 

New Devices Detect 
Primordial Glow 
If the inflationary
theorists are right, the universe we see, the 14 billion
light-years, is just a tiny piece of a much vaster
universe, or even a whole ensemble of them, forever out of
our view. 

According to the theory, therefore, our own little patch of
the cosmos should appear geometrically ""flat,"" the way a
section of a balloon looks flat when viewed close up. This
was the universe long thought to be the most beautiful and
simple. 

But it required, by the logic of Einstein's general
relativity, that there be much more dark matter, or
something, to the universe, enough to ""flatten"" space-time,
than astronomers had found. 

In fact, this prescription was so hard to reconcile with
other observations, of galaxies and their evolutions, that
by 1991 some astronomers and press reports suggested that
the entire theoretical edifice of inflation to blow up the
universe and cold dark matter to fill it, not to say the
Big Bang itself, might have to be junked. 

So it was with a sigh of relief that cosmologists greeted
the announcement in April 1992 that NASA's Cosmic
Background Explorer, or COBE, satellite had succeeded in
discerning faint blotches in the primordial cosmic radio
glow. 

These were the seeds from which, inflation predicted, large
cosmic structures would eventually grow. 

""If you're religious, it's like seeing God,"" said Dr.
George Smoot, a physicist from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory who led the COBE team. 

Astronomers say COBE signaled a transition in which heroic
ideas about the universe began to be replaced by heroic
data, as long-planned new telescopes and other instruments
went into operation. 

A year later, skywalking astronauts corrected the Hubble
telescope's myopic vision. The cosmic background radiation
has come in for particular scrutiny from new radio
telescopes mounted in balloons and on mountaintops. The
news has been good, though not decisive, for inflation. 

For three years, a series of increasingly high-resolution
observations has confirmed that the pattern of blotches
stippling the remnant of the primordial fireball is
consistent with the predictions from inflation and cold
dark matter. The instruments have now mapped details small
enough to have been the seeds of modern clusters of
galaxies. 

""I'm completely snowed by the cosmic background radiation,""
Dr. Guth said. ""The signal was so weak it wasn't even
detected until 1965, and now they're measuring fluctuations
of one part in 100,000."" 

Perhaps most important, the analysis of the fluctuations
indicates that the universe has a ""flat"" geometry, as
predicted by inflation. That was a triumph. Although
observations could not prove that inflation was right, a
nonflat universe would have been a blow to the theory, and
to cosmological orthodoxy. 

""Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the
earliest moments of creation, passed its first very
important test,"" Dr. Turner said at the time. 

The most precise measurements of the cosmic background, at
least in the near future, are generally expected to come
late this year from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Project, or
MAP, satellite, which was launched into space last year on
June 30. MAP will be followed by the European Space
Agency's Planck satellite, in 2006. 

It is highly unlikely that MAP or Planck will be able to
detect what Dr. Turner calls ""the smoking gun signature of
inflation."" The violent stretching of the universe should
roil space-time with so-called gravitational waves that
would leave a faint imprint on the cosmic fireball. 

Detecting those waves would not only confirm inflation, but
also might help scientists establish what caused the
inflation in the first place, giving science its first look
at the strange physics that prevailed when creation was
only about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of
a second old. 

The Universe's Fate 

Bleak Implications 
Of `Dark Energy' 

In 1998, two competing teams of
astronomers startled the scientific world with the news
that the expansion of the universe seemed to be speeding up
under the influence of a mysterious antigravity that seems
embedded in space itself and that is hauntingly reminiscent
of Einstein's old, presumably discredited, cosmological
constant. 

""Dark energy,"" the phenomenon was quickly named. 

If dark
energy is real and the acceleration continues, the galaxies
will eventually speed away from one another so quickly that
they couldn't see one another. The universe would become
cold and empty as the continued acceleration sucked away
the energy needed for life and thought. 

It would be ""the worst possible universe,"" for the quality
and quantity of life, said Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist
at Case Western Reserve University. 

Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, called the discovery of dark energy ""the
strangest experimental finding since I've been in physics.""


The discovery was a surprise to the astronomers involved.
Neither team had expected to find the universe
accelerating. They had each set out to measure by how much
the expansion of the universe was slowing because of the
gravity of its contents and thus settle the question of its
fate. 

One team was led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at
Lawrence Berkeley. The other team was a band of astronomers
led by Dr. Brian Schmidt of Mount Stromlo and the Siding
Spring Observatory in Australia. 

Each group employed far-flung networks of telescopes,
including the Hubble, and the Internet to find and monitor
certain exploding stars, or supernovas, as cosmic beacons.
Such explosions, the death rattles of massive stars, are
powerful enough to be seen clear across the universe when
the universe was younger and, presumably, expanding faster.


Leapfrogging each other across the universe, the two teams,
propitiously for their credibility, arrived at the same
answer at the same time: the cosmos was not slowing at all;
it was speeding up. 

Dr. Perlmutter, who had once resented the competition,
conceded, ""With only one group, it would have been a lot
harder to get the community to buy into such a surprising
result."" 

""This was a very strange result,"" said Dr. Adam Riess, a
member of Dr. Schmidt's team. ""It was the opposite of what
we thought we were doing."" 

The results have sent Einstein's old cosmological constant
to the forefront of cosmology. Despite his disavowal, the
constant had never really gone away and had in fact been
given new life by quantum physics. Einstein had famously
rejected quantum's randomness, saying God didn't play dice.


But it justified, in retrospect, his fudge factor. 

According to the uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum
theory, empty space was not empty, but rather foaming with
the energy of so-called virtual particles as they flashed
in and out of existence on borrowed energy. This so-called
vacuum energy could repel, just like Einstein's old
cosmological constant, or attract. 

The case for dark energy got even stronger a year later,
when the cosmic background observations reported evidence
of a flat universe. Because astronomers had been able to
find only about a third as much matter, both dark and
luminous, as was needed by Einstein's laws to create a flat
geometry, something else had to be adding to it. 

The discovery of dark energy exemplified Dr. Zeldovich's
view of the universe as the poor man's particle
accelerator, and it caught the physicists flat-footed,
somewhat to the pride of the astronomers. 

""A coming of age of astronomy,"" Dr. Dressler called it.


What is dark energy? The question now hangs over the
universe. 

Is it really Einstein's old fudge factor returned to haunt
his children? In that case, as the universe expands and the
volume of space increases, astronomers say, the push
because of dark energy will also increase, accelerating the
galaxies away from one another faster and faster, leading
to a dire dark future. 

Other physicists, however, have pointed out that the
theories of modern physics are replete with mysterious
force fields, collectively called ""quintessence,"" that
might or might not exist, but that could temporarily
produce negative gravity and mimic the action of a
cosmological constant. In that case, all bets on the future
are off. The universe could accelerate and then decelerate,
or vice versa as the dark energy fields rose or fell. 

A third possibility is that dark energy does not exist at
all, in which case not just the future, but the whole
carefully constructed jigsaw puzzle of cosmology, might be
in doubt. The effects of cosmic acceleration could be
mimicked, astronomers say, by unusual dust in the far
universe or by unsuspected changes in the characteristics
of supernovas over cosmic time. As a result, more groups
are joining the original two teams in the hunt for new
supernovas and other ways to measure the effects of dark
energy on the history of the universe. 

Dr. Perlmutter has proposed building a special satellite
telescope, the Supernova Astronomy Project, to investigate
exactly when and how abruptly the cosmic acceleration
kicked in. 

The Nagging QuestionsA Grand Synthesis, 
But Hardly Complete 
For all the new answers being
harvested, some old questions linger, and they have now
been joined by new ones. 

A flat universe is the most mathematically appealing
solution of Einstein's equations, cosmologists agree. But
they are puzzled by the specific recipe, large helpings of
dark matter and dark energy, that nature has chosen. Dr.
Turner called it ""a preposterous universe."" 

But Dr. Martin Rees, a Cambridge University cosmologist,
said that the discovery of a deeper principle governing the
universe and, perhaps, life, may alter our view of what is
fundamental. Some features of the universe that are now
considered fundamental - like the exact mixture of dark
matter, dark energy and regular stuff in the cosmos - may
turn out to be mere accidents of evolution in one out of
the many, many universes allowed by eternal inflation. 

""If we had a theory, then we would know whether there were
many big bangs or one,"" Dr. Rees said. The answers to these
and other questions, many scientists suspect, have to await
the final unification of physics, a theory that reconciles
Einstein's relativity, which describes the shape of the
universe, to the quantum chaos that lives inside it. 

Such a theory, quantum gravity, is needed to describe the
first few moments of the universe, when it was so small
that even space and time should become fuzzy and
discontinuous. 

For two decades, many physicists have placed their bets for
quantum gravity on string theory, which posits that
elementary particles are tiny strings vibrating in a 10- or
11-dimensional space. Each kind of particle, in a sense,
corresponds to a different note on the string. 

In principle, string theory can explain all the forces of
nature. But even its adherents concede that their equations
are just approximations to an unknown theory that they call
M-theory, with ""M"" standing for matrix, magic, mystery or
even mother, as in ""mother of all theories."" Moreover, the
effects of ""stringy physics"" are only evident at energies
forever beyond the limits of particle accelerators. 

Some string theorists have ventured into cosmology, hoping,
to discover some effect that would show up in the poor
man's particle accelerator, the sky. 

In addition to strings, the theory also includes membranes,
or ""branes,"" of various dimensions. Our universe can be
envisioned as such a brane floating in higher-dimensional
space like a leaf in a fish tank, perhaps with other brane
universes nearby. These branes could interact
gravitationally or even collide, setting off the Big Bang. 

In one version suggested last year by four cosmologists
led by Dr. Steinhardt of Princeton, another brane would
repeatedly collide with our own. They pass back and forth
through each other, causing our universe to undergo an
eternal chain of big bangs. 

Such notions are probably the future for those who are paid
to wonder about the universe. 

And the fruits of this work could yet cause cosmologists to
reconsider their new consensus, warned Dr. Peebles of
Princeton, who has often acted as the conscience of the
cosmological community, trying to put the brakes on faddish
trends. 

He wonders whether the situation today can be compared to
another historical era, around 1900, when many people
thought that physics was essentially finished and when the
English physicist Lord Kelvin said that just a couple of
""clouds"" remained to be dealt with. 

""A few annoying tidbits, which turned out to be relativity
and quantum theory,"" the twin revolutions of 20th-century
science, Dr. Peebles said. 

Likewise, there are a few clouds today like what he called
""the dark sector,"" which could have more complicated
physics than cosmologists think. 

""I'm not convinced these clouds herald revolutions as deep
as relativity and quantum mechanics,"" Dr. Peebles said.
""I'm not arguing that they won't."" 

As for the fate of the universe, we will never have a firm
answer, said Dr. Sandage, who was Hubble's protg and has
seen it all. 

""It's like asking, `Does God exist?' "" he said.


Predicting the future, he pointed out, requires faith that
simple mathematical models really work to describe the
universe. 

""I don't think we really know how things work,"" he said.


Although Dr. Sandage does not buy into all aspects of the
emerging orthodoxy, he said it was a fantastic time to be
alive. 

""It's all working toward a much grander synthesis than we
could have imagined 100 years ago,"" he said. ""I think this
is the most exciting life I could have had.""

No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.

One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box).

For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.)

this is serious. the highly confidential information that dermot is
out of the office has leaked! i think it would be best if we all
email the ""Systems Manager"" as a matter of urgency. in lieu of an
email address i suggest emailling all of postmaster, info, sales,
hostmaster, webmaster, support and accounts (and any other address
one can think of).

now, considering the critical nature of this leak, if you do not 
receive an adequate reply i think one would be duty bound to raise 
the matter again, and again if needs be, until one gets a 
satisfactory reply.

also, i notice a lot of people on this lot who post from company 
addresses do not have disclaimers on their emails. i would encourage 
everyone in a professional position to raise the matter of 
disclaimers internally and ensure that disclaimers are implemented 
for company emails, stationary and phone systems.

finally, the email-disclaimers advocacy site 

	http://www.emaildisclaimers.com/

may prove to be a useful resource. rather strangely one of the quotes 
on the front-page of their site is:

	'The disclaimers added to the end of emails are not legally 
	binding, but it's always good practice to try and disclaim liability'

	-- Michael Chissick, Head of Internet law at Field Fisher 
	Waterhouse

However, i suggest this quote, partly the initial part, be ignored
and that other more favourable quotes (by self-aggrandising
pundits^W^Wleading experts)  be heeded instead.  Also, there is a
vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large
company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some
kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having
implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a
rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).

Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!

By  Larry Barrett

http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,3959,369038,00.asp

My breasts have been halved, breaded and shipped to their current
resting-place on a shelf in a supermarket in Denver. My legs should be
arriving in Moscow any time now. All my feathers have been processed and are
now being eaten by cattle somewhere in Texas. My blood and bones have been
rendered for cat food, fertilizer and who-knows- what else. My wings have
been seasoned with barbecue sauce and served with a side of ranch dressing
and celery at some bar and grill in New York City. My feet? Well, they're
headed to Asia where I'm told they're something of a delicacy.

-----------

So, a couple of things intrigued me about this byline, and its associated
main article:
And On the 47th Day, This Chicken Went to Market
By  Debbie Gage
http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,3959,367672,00.asp

- I had no idea how much computer controls played into the raising of
livestock
- I had no idea how fast a chicken is raised these days

It also strikes me that it will not be very long before livestock is
genetically engineered to be dumber and meatier, and better adapted to
living in industrial conditions.

Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time immediately. It's an
old tip, but it bears repeating: ""I'll often find Web snippets I'd like to
keep - but I don't want to save the entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad.
Easy! Get to the most common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs |
Accessories | Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select
Properties. You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad, Windows
offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch Notepad in an instant.
I highlight the text I want to keep, copy it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and
then save the new text file wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to
copy paragraphs that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the
same folder as the download)."" Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna get cranky.

And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian Rich reminds
us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is jv16.org. The program is called jv16
Power Tools, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It combines a full-
on registry management tool with several file manager tools: one to hunt down
temporary files in any format and the other to help perform advanced file
searches and comparisons. Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the
attention of the consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows Me, and now
XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry corruption. It backs up
everything it changes and is very easy to use. If you're interested in
something of shareware-quality with forum support (for absolutely nothing),
get this program. Anyway, I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals
do at Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition."" Consider
this a huge nod!

I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the United Kingdom
has one for us, too: ""As a dedicated subscriber, I just had to tell about this
one. Have you ever been driven mad trying to find out the name of the piece of
music on a television advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer
to that problem and, given that many multinationals use the same advertising
in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys as well. Check out
Commercial Breaks and Beats. I have no connection with it; I'm just grateful
that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it. If you check the
message board on the site, you'll see that I'm not alone."" This Google
Directory can help fill in the blanks, I'm sure. I almost fell out of my chair
the other day when I heard ""Yeh Yeh"" (by TMBG) being played on a Chrysler
advertisement. Way to go: John, John, Dan, Dan, and Dan! You're the dogs kids
love to bite.

And what's say we round out the report with another tip? Lockergnomie David
Brown can oblige: ""The e-mail forwarding service is a good idea, but you can

**QuicKalendar v1.0.2 [430k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://www.trinfinitysoftware.com/quickalendar.shtml

{Calendar utility} You say you want to get together on the 25th, but what DAY
is that? I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know
what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a
Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on
the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I
am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be
without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! ""QuicKalendar gives you quick and
easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on
screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments."" You need to keep
in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar
displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout
will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in
normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is
to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that
you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex!

  
**Diatris v1.0 [407k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://www.webruler.com/mtreciokas/

{Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. To me
everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder
why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only
problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy.
Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-
like games. ""For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically
and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two
diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game
H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most
block drop games."" I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you
are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris
fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so
check it out!

**How to Troubleshoot Issues with Reading CDs**

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q321641

{Disc device troubleshooting} ""This article describes how you can troubleshoot
issues reading CD-ROM or DVD-ROM optical discs. This article also discusses
how to troubleshoot common issues with CD-R and CD-RW devices. The steps in
this article apply to compact disc (CD-ROM) drives, compact disc recordable
(CD-R) drives, compact disc re-writable (CD-RW) drives, and digital video disc
(DVD) drives."" To summarize, you should try the steps on this site before
calling your technical support. Some of the steps include closing unnecessary
software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc.
Make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if
you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. The
steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably
be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. If this article
doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you
won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because
you'll already know what the problem ISN'T!

**Modem Spy v3.1.3b [230k] W9x/2k/XP $25**  
Unearthed by Sergei Polishchuk

http://www.modemspy.com/

{Answering machine} ""Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording.
Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays
back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via
sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software
automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID."" Gnomie Brian Stevens
tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his
machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, ""I was able to load the
program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio
memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this
audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem
to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to
the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid
program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering
machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!"" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID
to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service
provider.

**The Avocado Papers**  
Unearthed by Meryl Evans

http://www.theavocadopapers.com/

After surfing serious Web site upon serious Web site, you just need to find a
site where you can relax and have a good time. TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of
those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that
the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually
rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week ""Steve Schneider
Interviews Himself""). If you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the
lives of others, you can read Ron Bork's diary or enter the Avocado Chat.
Although the makers of the Web site don't even know what it is about, I think
it is quite apparent... fun! Go check out the Web site for yourself and see if
you can pin down its rhyme or reason. Worst-case scenario, you can always sign
up for their current promotion... free linguine!

 GnomeTIP  
  
---  
  
This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. ""The Windows XP operating
system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it
makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments
are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed
applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence
the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP
can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows
versions."" To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps
you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip
is letting your PC process any ""idle tasks."" Idle tasks are tasks that your PC
executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include
file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work
items. ""All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in
advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks
a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately,
without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from
the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe
advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks."" Once running, it may take up to around 15
minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active
through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for
benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on
Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.

Date: Not supplied

The President's niece will no longer have to forge prescriptions for Valium. 
All she'll have to do is participate in an unruly public demonstration to get a 
free dose. Unfortunately for her, the government has no plans to shoot rocks of 
cocaine at demonstrators, so she'll still have to depend on her drug dealer for 
that. 

    The U.S. military is exploring ways to use drugs such as Valium to calm 
    people without killing them during riots or other crowd control situations 
    where lethal weapons are inappropriate.

I have such a system.  It works like this :
    1)  sa-exim scans the message during the SMTP interaction
    2)  if it scores high enough it is rejected
        2.1)    if it is rejected, exim mentions that in the reject log
        2.2)    if it isn't rejected it is delivered
            2.2.1)  it is up to the user to deal with (filter as
                    desired) the lower-scoring spam
    3)  I have a script run as a daily cron job to run through the
        reject log and deposit a report in the user's home directory
        indicating what was rejected and way (SA isn't the only cause
        for rejection)

Obviously my setup is rather tied to exim and sa-exim, but if you want
the reporting script I can send it to you.

designed in 1999, to others that are still free trials.

I have looked through the archived list and the only thing I have seen 
about this error is a possible permission problem on the log file.
I did what it said in the archives, basically change the permission on the

Any other help would be appreciated, maybe I'm missing something.

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.


Good morning,

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues.
I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my
colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution
of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it
confidential because of the nature of this business.

Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director
of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.

The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed
on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars).
Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed,
so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental
agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the
Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the
beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and
approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive
US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.

This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality.
It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of
powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you
and hope that you will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for
further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.

May God's blessings be with you even as you reply.

Regards,


MR. AYANDA MAREDI",1,0

I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which 
makes the process of rotating log files very simple.  If there's an 
official source for this script, I couldn't find it.  (My hosting 
provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.) 
 However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.

Good luck...

You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's
simple:

1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only
bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I
already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.

2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.

I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other
potential new rule. When I test against my corpus here's what I get:

OVERALL     SPAM  NONSPAM     S/O   SCORE  NAME
  13851     8919     4932    0.64    0.00  (all messages)
      0        0        0    0.00   -1.00  HABEAS_SWE

The score of -1.0 is pretty harmless right now, but it still looks like a
useless rule so far.

    by tons of cool tech. 50 inch plasma panels, desktop LC Displays, boxes of

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove
the appropiate zone(s) on your slaves, and refresh your DNS servers.

Bind has a special case, if you set the serial to '0' I think. DNS &
Bind should have something on that.

Unfortunately, no.  APAs are not accorded  equal opportunity in workplaces presently.   	Equal opportunity means: ""For every man, woman and  child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability  will take them.""  Statistics, mostly gathered by government  studies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all  other Americans to rise to the top in the academic world,  corporate world, the federal government.  There seems to exist  an invisible resistance to AAs' developing to the maximal of  their potentials  --  A Glass Ceiling. 	Let's look at a concrete case.  A lot of our best people are  employed in universities.  Their average performance has been  outstanding.  What's their chance of rising to the top?   	University administrators are recruited almost exclusively  from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in  universities.  Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty +  professionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the  opportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races.   Nationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21.  That is,  for every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black  administrators.  The ratio for Native American is 0.20; for white  (non-Hispanic) is 0.16; and for Hispanic is 0.15.  However, it is  only 0.06 for Asian American.  Get on the Web and check it out  for yourself!  Source:  Dept. of Education - , Table B-1f. 	The above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly  ""enlightened"" academic world.  The situation in the corporate  world, state and federal governments is worse.   	In E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two  major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and  help make our beloved nation ""a more perfect Union.""   There has  already been progress on account of that strategy.

I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
for it.
Minicom is very much able to dial out.
But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
somewhere).
It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.

Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

Thanks a million.

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.

I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.

We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 

If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.

Yours faithfully,

Imagine yourself as part owner of the most interesting, full service state-of-
the-art medical facility, equipped with the most sophisticated and effective
scanning diagnostic tools available today.

Electron Beam Tomography is a cutting-edge diagnostic technology capable of
providing a crystal-ball-like look into your medical future. This technology
has been featured on Oprah, Larry King, Good Morning America, and USA Today.

EBT Scans are now covered by most health insurance companies and HMOs, causing
an explosion in usership and exceptionally high demand for this procedure.

EBT can identify heart disease years before a treadmill test would show an
abnormality and many years before a heart attack might occur.

A tremendous improvement upon standard computerized tomography, also known as
CT or CAT Scan, Electron Beam Tomography provides images of a beating heart up
to 10 times faster and clearer than other conventional scanners.

The dramatic capabilities of this spectacular technology should provide an
extraordinary investment opportunity for those establishing state-of-the-art
outpatient clinics, in order to provide the EBT body scan procedures to health
conscious Americans. Projected 10-year return of 916%.

A full-body scan using this technology can also be used to detect
osteoporosis, aneurisms, emphysema, gallstones, hiatal hernia, degenerative
spine conditions, as well as cancer of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and colon.

Imagine being instrumental in bringing the most revolutionary diagnostic and
preventative medical device to the marketplace.

Get more conference info here Back to Top Enterprise Java Education Strategies Floyd Marinescu to co-teach J2EE Patterns - Sept 16, Dallas  Dear TSS Members, I thought you'd be interested to know that The Middleware Company has created a J2EE Patterns training course that I will be co-teaching in Dallas during the week of September 16th. The course combines and improves upon the best J2EE design patterns material available in my book EJB Design Patterns, Sun's Core Patterns, TheServerSide's patterns repository and others.  I have just reviewed the final material and I am very excited with the end product. This class takes an indepth look at all the most important patterns today, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. One of the cool things about the course is that it shows you how the patterns were implemented in a variety of popular open source frameworks and production applications, including TheServerSide.com.  I highly recommend this course to the seasoned J2EE developer who wants to master the cutting edge in J2EE architecture and design.  If you'd like to register for the course, simply click here:  http://www.middleware-company.com/training/j2eepatterns.shtml Sincerely,  Floyd Marinescu  Author, EJB Design Patterns  Director of TheServerSide.com J2EE Community  Back to Top New Patterns    iXML Pattern     By Venkatesh Balakumar        In due course, we will be finding ourselves in the middle of Web services, which will granulate into representing all data in XML. For preparing and implementing Web services, it's necessary to express all data in XML. This pattern does the same. Read more on this pattern.  Widget Pages     By Guilherme Silva        This pattern allows for using XMLC and Barracuda without exposing their APIs to widget users. In fact it allows for transparently using more than one widget implementation at the same time, which is ideal for migrating or upgrading.  Read more on this pattern. Back to Top New App Server Reviews   JRun 4.0 - Good Stuff      By Jason McKerr        Some general impressions I had of JRun: It's very easy to get it up and running.   Allaire-now-Macromedia has always had one of my favorite servlet engines.  The Java Management Console (web-based admin interface) has gotten a tonne better.   It's dead easy to plug into just about any IDE (I've done it with JBuilder Enterprise 6, and the Intellij IDEA EAP (Builds 640 -642).  The JSP compiler is smokin! Very, very fast.

Last week, Axialis Software released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most
powerful icon editor / manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict,
I asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one. Perhaps
you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a nice little contest
involving some of the most powerful sites on the Internet? Here's the deal:
you create five (or more) icons between now and the end of July 2002, upload
them to your [FREE] DeviantArt account (under Contests / Axialis Icon
Contest), and one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself,
MattEO from DeviantArt, KarmaGirl from WinCustomize, Voodoo from Neowin, and
Marc from Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not only
receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some of their icons
will get bundled with a future version of the software! Ownership is retained
by the original author, so don't hold back. Here's your chance at fame and
fortune. Or, at least fame and free software.

Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new (unofficial)
Google SearchTool today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar
(sorry, I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave Cacheman another go; I
haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a great piece of shareware,
but I didn't realize it was THIS good. The speed increase has been quite
noticeable (even on Storm Shadow, my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is
brilliant. And so is Repligator 9.0. It gives me access to instant special
effects - a one-stop shop for digital photo fun. I'm still debating whether or
not to install the latest Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test
machine, which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just wanna
run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and ""12 Mistakes Executives Make When
Planning Web Strategy"" is available for FREE with the purchase of ANY
GnomeTome (including our 50 freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your
boss doesn't know as much as s/he should.

There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on Emusic now. They inked a deal with
Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any more to get access to
even more MP3s. This is the ONLY way to go, and I hope and pray that more
record labels will eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than
a place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters knowledge; the
Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has encouraged creativity and
commerce. The one thing the Internet is NOT: a fad. Its potential is
limitless, as long as it remains flexible and not controlled by any one
company. This Palladium thing has got me more than a little spooked. It,
combined with the service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that
drives people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate to
admit it). Software and music pirates unwittingly created DRM. I best not find
out that you're part of the problem.

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

{Sun, moon, and planets} Why is it all the other planets have really cool
names for their respective moon(s), but Earth's is simply referred to as
""moon?"" We should change it to something catchier, like ""Joey Joe-Joe Junior
Shabbadu."" Don't mind me, I was just looking at this new application. It shows
a graphical representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides detailed
information such as the planet's distance from the sun, its volume, mass, and
gravity in relation to Earth. What I found most interesting was how long a
single ""day"" lasts on different planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is
equal to six days on Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the
Christmas tree for longer than we thought.

**Pop-Up Menu Navigation Software**  
Scribbled by Pat Wong

http://popup.jscentral.com/

I found some really cool software to generate Web site navigation menus, and I
thought you might be interested in learning about it. There are several
examples on the company's site, as well as on my own. Here's a small write-up
about it; perhaps you'd be interested in running this in a future Lockergnome
issue? We've all seen a lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up
text, neat mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a combination
of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise that goes way beyond some
of us. At last, it's possible to easily generate just such a menu with some
very user-friendly screens to enter the data you want to use.

Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully licensed
version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the Web Designer
license). The biggest difference? With the licensed version, you get the
ability to save a menu you've generated so you can modify it later. Your only
alternative, if you want to make even a simple change to a menu generated by
the freeware version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or
diving into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be forewarned:
The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that could potentially be a
nightmare. I decided to buy the fully licensed version and I'm really glad I
did. Sorry if I sound like a commercial for the company; I don't work for them
or stand to be compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while.

Unearthed by a Gnomie

{Calculate it} Calculators aren't just for adding and subtracting numbers or
spelling silly phrases by turning the calculator upside down. How about
figuring out the financing on your new car? What about the seeding rates for
your wheat farm? Perhaps you programmers out there need a nice HEX calculator.
And, of course, what football fan wouldn't like to calculate the passing rates
for his or her favorite quarterback? If it seems like I'm all over the map
here, it's because this site provides links to all kinds of calculator sites
for all kinds of people. Trust me: it all adds up to a unique and useful site.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve Lafferty: ""In a
recent article over the PayPal issue, it was stated that when using a credit
card illegally, the owner of that card is responsible for the first $50.
However, sometging that very few people know about is that there is a US
Federal provision in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E /
Electronic Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your 'bank card' is
used without your permission, you are not responsible for any of the charges.
My suggestion is never to use a credit card - and only use your bank debit
card. That way, if someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of
the charges."" For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people living in the
USA. If you haven't been watching your statements like a hawk lately, you'd be
wise to start soon. Identity theft is a growing concern. When my wallet was
stolen, I found IDENTITYTHEFT.ORG to be a godsend.

nobody@dogma.slashnull.org,yyyy+blogged@spamassassin.taint.org,"Fri, 23 Aug 2002 12:09:50 +0100",blogged item,"BlogStart:  **Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely legal, way to make money. BlogEnd:  LinkText: Billy in the Bowl From:         daev  Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler A story of my new neighbourhood... The Irish Digest July 1964 The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors. Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life  DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl"" The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this "" bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs, one in each hand. Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an unusually handsome face. This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers-by from their small change. The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would come along. He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity. ""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking. As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on Dublin's North Quays. When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help. Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes. In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar. Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter. On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder and caused a great stir. Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months ""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder. Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that finished Billy's career of crime. Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch. Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him, however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails. Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye. The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy. ""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night. daev _______________________________ Rev.

###  **Government Personal and Business Grants Facts:**

**Over 20 Million People Get Government Money Every Year:**

1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money to start or expand a business

4,000,000 people get money to invest in real estate

6,000,000 people get money to go to college

10,000,000 people get free help and training for a better job

##  **Getting Business Grants**

> Anyone thinking about going into business for themselves, or wanting to
> expand an existing business should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-
> money-shop"" where FREE business grants to start or expand a business is
> being held for you by the Federal Government.

It sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source of
free business help delivers:

Over $30 billion dollars in free business grants and low-interest loans;

over one-half trillion dollars in procurement contracts; and

over $32 billion dollars in FREE consulting and research grants.

> With an economy that remains unpredictable, and a need for even greater
> economic development on all fronts, the federal government is more willing
> than it ever has been before to give you the money you need to own your own
> business and become your own boss!

In spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly huge
that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for an equal
share, they would each receive over $70,000.

Most people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who to
contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do receive
FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you should also.

Those old white dudes could never see a world that wasnt ALL deeply
religeous (science wasnt up to speed yet). How could you not hold these
principles as just how you should act? They got that religeon and government
should not be the same thing, they didnt get that when society doesnt have
any beliefs are all (capitalism is more atheist then communism ever was) it
quickly goes to hell as some people have 100 billion and all the rest have
too dolla a day.

Having been raised in a generally ethical way, it was a big jump to learn to
run a business. Lots of lessions in being ruthless, and a few about being
sure to hire large Italians to do debt collection (it works!).

No shit, really? Seriously, if you're not all about screwing over the

These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with current events surrounding the companies you hold. Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems. Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft. In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals. So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens. WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough. Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.) WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%. Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong. WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058 But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059 The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.) And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it. WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds. Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!"" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061 I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even way below. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062 As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either. WARNING SIGN 5: ""IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER"" For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063 As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher. Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out. HOMEWORK For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following: - Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four   quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,   staying about the same, or weakening? - Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past   four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing   slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures? - Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past   three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net   income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look   at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around   due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much   more indicative of real cash flow trends.) - If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center   and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know   whether your company has any debt, just type your company name   into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)   http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064 - Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its   current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is   there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario   already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,   this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's   still a question you should consider.) To help you out, we've put together the Foolish Stock Information Form to track all of your research and information about your stocks. You can get to by clicking here.

Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals. So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens. Warning sign 1: Slowing sales growth Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough. Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.) Warning sign 2: Divergent sales and profit growth By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%. Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong.  Warning sign 3: Plummeting cash flowsIn 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion. But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way. The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.) And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it. Warning sign 4: Watch those bonds Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds. Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!"" I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even way below. As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either. Warning sign 5: ""It just doesn't get any better"" For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year. As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher. Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out. HomeworkFor this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following: Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating, staying about the same, or weakening? Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures? Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much more indicative of real cash flow trends.) If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know whether your company has any debt, just type your company name into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.) Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market, this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's still a question you should consider.)  To help you out, we've put together the Foolish Stock Information Form to track all of your research and information about your stocks. You can get to by clicking here. We've also outlined how to find all of the information above, here. So dust off the old calculator, find your company's financials, and get to work. Quarterly financial data is best found in company 10-Qs, and annual data is best found in company 10-Ks. You should be able to find all of this information using financials from either the company website or at Fool.com on the Quotes & Data area.  Feeling a little lost?If you're new to using SEC filings, read this overview of financial statements. Above all else, just do your best. Once you've done what you can, report your findings to your teammates! We've also put together an ongoing list of resources so you can dive in a little deeper.

Bill and Matt In case you missed this week's earlier announcement, please note that there is a correction to Lesson 1. The fifth automatic sell rule regarding stock option grants should read: We set 3% as our maximum for developed companies, 5% for developing ones (use $500 million in sales as a rough boundary between the two).

THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !  
  
==================================================  
  
 **BE IN GOOD MONEY WITHIN A YEAR!!!  
**  
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this
letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an
entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it
really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal.  
  
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the
simple instructions, they are bound to make some money with only $25 out of
pocket cost''.  
  
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  
  
This is what one had to say:  
  
""I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in
21 weeks, with money still coming in.""  
  
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.  
  
===================================================  
  
Here is another testimonial:  
  
""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But
one day when I received it again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.
I followed the simple instructions and walaa .... 3 weeks later the money
started to come in.  
  
 The first month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a
total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program,
I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in
this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  
  
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE,
GUARANTEED!  
  
**INSTRUCTIONS:  
**  
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====  
 **For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT  
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON
THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR
ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.  
**  
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.  You
will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell
them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00.  
  
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.  
  
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each
report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will lose out on a majority
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how
it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and
if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But
it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is
instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Remember, honesty
reaps the reward!!!  
  
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE
the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it
through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.  
  
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.  
  
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.  
  
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.  
  
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2  
  
6.... **Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.** **PLEASE MAKE  
SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!  
**  
==========================================================  
  
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on
your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  
  
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you
with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send
bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:  
  
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY  
==========================================================  
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also
assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be
much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out
hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).  
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2%
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  
  
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.
That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.  
  
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  
  
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails
sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.  
  
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50
million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #5  
  
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).  
Your total income in this example is:  
1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000

Grand Total=$555,550.00  
  
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF
MONEY !  
  
=========================================================  
  
REMEMBER FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU
MAILED TO.  Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me,
many people will do just that, and more!  
  
METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET  
=======================================================  
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE
places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get
a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add
METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day
service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with
your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise
until they receive the report.  
  
=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================  
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S.
CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is
concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets
of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR
E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  
  
PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW!!

**$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$  
**  
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  
  
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks,
continue sending e-mails until you do.  
  
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should
receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue
advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  
  
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX,
because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to
roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on
the list, you are placed in front of a Different report.  
  
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF
E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.  There is NO LIMIT to the income
you can generate from this business !!!  
  
======================================================  
  
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  
  
You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the
rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make
more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined.
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It
works exceedingly well as it is now.  
  
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name
and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed
above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails
and your name will be on every one of them.  Remember though, the more you
send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have
given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become
financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  
  
============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================  
  
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant
with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received
this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of
the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages
involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed

I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.

Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
also have a message board.

The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
userfriendly.

All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.

Good point, I didn't think of that. However, that doesn't help with a
case statement, which IMHO is cleaner than using an if statement if you
have a lot of branches... but then again maybe that should be refactored
away with polymorphism :)

huh?  i missed all this.  do you want the string all on one line?

the string repeated over and over, but with linebreaks in between,
this works:

    yes ""$STRING"" | head -""$NUMBER""

use sed to remove the newline i guess if you want.  the utilities yes,
head and sed are on pretty much every unix.

<robertm@att.net>,<webmaster@efi.ie>,"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 05:29:50 +0500",Your eBay account is about to expire!,"Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

the rhetoric.

Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):

Anything either you or I have to say about their motivation is
speculation.  Bearing that disclaimer in mind, here's mine:  They make
money from selling boxed sets.  They're glad to make some versions
available for almost-unrestricted distribution (not ""for value"") via CD
duplication or the Internet that they estimate won't substitute for
boxed-set sales.

For example, they _could_ have packaged what I call the ""FTP edition"" 
in ISO9660 images.  The fact that they didn't suggests to me that they
see the inconvenience of mirroring FTP Edition i386 files (which, at the
moment, are v. 8.0) as motivation for all but the really determined to
buy boxed sets, instead.  

Likewise, they _could_ release a v. 8.0 (current) version of the
""evaluation"" single-disk ISO image.  Instead, they always keep it
several versions behind.  This again seems like an incentive to buy a
boxed set, after ""evaluating"" SuSE via the ISO image.

Again, the above is my speculation (only) about their motivations.  All
we know of a certainty is what permissions they've granted, which are a
bit messy and complex, but nonetheless quite clear.

Those permissions, as a reminder, apply to the SuSE-produced components,
YaST, YaST2, the distribution installer program, and possibly other
utilities that I don't know of.  _They_ wrote that code, and have every
right to grant or withhold permissions as suit them best.

Hmm, let's slow down, here:  There's a persistent misconception that
it's possible to place somebody else's work under a new licence without
his permission.  Not so.  There is nothing in copyright law that would
make that possible.

The copyright _owner_ has inherent rights in his (e.g., software) work,
and is entitled to issue as many _instances_ of his code under diverse
licences as he wishes.  (If he gives you a copy with no licence
statement, there's effectively a default licence by operation of
copyright law.  To avoid going into a long digression, let me just say
that it's a proprietary licence by default.  That's why, in order to
have open source software at all, there must be an explicit licence
from the copyright holder.)

No Linux distribution _ever_ entails relicensing people's software
without their explicit permission -- since no such relicensing can occur
at all. 
 
You cannot get away with taking SuSE Linux AG's work and redistributing
it under what you claim to be a BSD licence, or the GPL, or anything at
all other than what the copyright owner has specified, because you
simply lack the right to do so.  Claiming to do it would be copyright
violation.

If Stallman and friends at the GPL (let alone Linus Torvalds and kernel
contributors) had intended to prohibit putting GPLed works on the same
CDs as proprietary ones, and selling the result only via retail stores
(plus mail order, etc.) in shrink-wrapped boxes, I'm 100% certain they
could and would have done so.

Guess what?  They did not.  They didn't even require that anybody give
you copies of the GPLed components, ever, at all.  All they did was
require that _if_ you received GPLed software lawfully, then you had to 
be able to get matching source code for a limited period, upon request.

Spirit of the GPL, you say?  I'd suggest that Stallman and company knew
exactly what they were doing, and that the degree of access to GPLed
software is exactly what they had in mind.

Mais si.

You are indeed under a misconception, and may want to read the text of
the GPL to verify this fact.  The GPL does _not_ entitle you to a copy
of any binary software.  Section 2 provides for rights to access to
matching source code _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of a covered
binary.  That section provides three alternative mechanisms for the
distributor to provide such access.  And SuSE _do_ actually provide 
exactly that access.

Or so I think to be the case.  If you believe there's some GPLed
codebase that you can lawfully receive from SuSE whose matching source
code they are not making available exactly as required, please tell us
which codebase that is.  (That would be SuSE Linux AG's headache, not
any of ours, but it might be interesting to examine.)

Your understanding is almost correct, but not quite.  (1) The access
provisions of the GPL concern access to _source code_, not binaries.
(2) It kicks in _only_ for people who've lawfully received covered
binaries.  (3) _Covered_ software means instances of codebases actually
placed under the GNU GPL by their copyright owners.  The mere act of 
placing a piece of software on a CD-ROM with GPLed software doesn't GPL
it.

In fact, the assertion to the contrary is a favourite FUD tactic from
enemies of Linux:  They're forever trying to convince software producers
that using GPLed software in any way with their proprietary offerings
will ""taint"" their copyrights and force them to put their property under
the GPL.  It's simply not so.

> one for which I would be willing to pay.

That's nice, but they're not _offering_ the exact contents of the boxed
sets free of charge and lawful to duplicate & redistribute, or ""borrow"".
For one thing, as you will have noticed from my earlier listing of
components, the boxed sets' CD-ROMs include quite a lot of _third-party_
proprietary software.  SuSE Linux AG _cannot_ allow you (or your friend)
to hand out copies of that software freely, because it's not theirs in
the first place.
 
> I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll end up doing that!

If you mean the 3-CD core set of RH 7.3, good.  It's a quite decent
distribution.  But bear in mind that the RH 7.3 boxed sets include
some other third-party applications whose owners would be very upset to
find them being copied or ""borrowed"". 

> I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can
> borrow them, but not copy them? 

No.

Look, it's a collection of software, many elements of which may not be
lawfully just given out to multiple people:  Your friend installing it,
then _not_ erasing it but merely letting you ""borrow"" the CDs results in
the product being installed in multiple places.  That's unauthorised
copying.

Well, if you don't like SuSE, then you probably won't like Caldera
eDesk, Xandros Desktop, Lycoris Deskop LX, Libranet, Lindows, or KRUD,
either.  Depending on your criteria, you also might not like Red Hat,
Linux-Mandrake, or Yellow Dog, since all of those have boxed-set retail
sets that include CD-ROMs that may not be publicly redistributed.
 
(I don't even use SuSE.  I'm just trying to clarify the licensing
question.)

Hash: SHA1

Ok, time for me to pipe in.  :)

Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren't working
and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each
other.  MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to
have issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's
fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.

In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives
than false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I
use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I
tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like
this exists, yet):

        red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from
                several sources, and noone says ""I know this is NOT
                spam.""  I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or
                archive it for humor value.  I expect no
                false-positives to be here.

        yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).

        green   This is probably not spam.

spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't
switch, not is/maybe/isn't.  That said, razor is but one check in my
spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports ""doesn't match known spam""
once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get
it.

Give yourself credit :-) it's a nice solution,

I'm looking to build a completely silent pc. It's gonna be a gateway for
a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only
spitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial) 
It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? 

I'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not
worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) 
any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new
shoebox size totally silent pcs and I cant use an old laptop as I have a
pci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so)

And where can I get a fanless psu? I know they exist because the lads
at antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember
a slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!

They did decline to mention that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record -  the average salary for a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$  21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call  centers that have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some  entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in  1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other  words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people,   union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument  to this is that many college graduates  leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is  that we are the thin edge (one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of  third-world wages and work practices coming  to North America. I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they  could maintain that (and prosper) just says  volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people  there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large  employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired  employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of  rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed  a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey,  guess what - used to be a VP at the company. That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper -  as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in  place. And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of  some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent, are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received  generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about the labor markets here. > >BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, >*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, >all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and >there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition, >most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have >*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically >all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and >not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. > >That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The >People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge.

A particularly  galling example is high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that  it is an area where the pricing approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the  telecom industry (maintain your monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through  the same regulators) meet. Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole  entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer  seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to  produce profits for the favored few. > >In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not >theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and >redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just >that: horseshit, happy or otherwise. > >To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx >wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense. >   > I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like  they're the biggest believers in the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the  rights of that ""proletariat"" you've just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital  in the hands of a few (ideally people who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh,  and lie - use the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain  amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the  Republic party seems to be the more homeless under  each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be. And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining  standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net, greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the  work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right  to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining  standards of living) is the reality.

That was my thinking.

Also, now that we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change every time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about the folder. -- Brent Welch Software Architect, Panasas Inc Pioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network www.panasas.com welch@panasas.com _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",0,1

I'll ever have $250 to spend on fonts. *Update:* Kevin Marks[1], who is 
stupendously incredible for far more things than I can list here points out 
that it's _included with OS X_. I knew Mac OS X included a lot of grat fonts[2]
, but I don't know how I overlooked this. (Matthew Carter, I'd be happy to pay 
you the two cents in royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of 
fonts.)

You have not explained why the increase in CO2 concentrations is not

Precisely which theoreticians do you mean? What, exactly, do you mean by a
global warming theoretician -- scientists in this area don't use that term.

I assure you that not all scientists performing modeling of global
temperature phenomena agree with your assertions.

I've not seen any claim from SuSE of copyright over the distribution 
as a whole.  (That would be a ""compilation copyright"", to use the legal
term.)  But they definitely assert (and in fact own) copyright over
YaST, YaST2, and the associated installer program.

So, if one wanted to distribute a version of SuSE free of encumbrances
from SuSE Linux AG, one would merely have to write a replacement
installer and do without YaST/YaST2 (and probably a few other things
they wrote).  A Simple Matter of Programming.

Ther are options that will go up to crazy capacities by using

Subject: [ILUG] Backup solutions


Hi folks,
I maintain a colocated server on behalf of a small group of individuals,
and am looking at backup solutions. Is it possible to get some sort of low-
end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40
Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost
but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.

What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device,
then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the
last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible?
I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part
of the charge for colocation is rackspace.

Thanks,
Ciaran.

P.S. You can get an RSX Type S with 200hp for $23K. I have not yet
driven an RSX, but if it's anything like a late model Integra, it will
kick the ass of the Mustang in anything that requires you to actually
move the steering wheel from the center position.

That might work easily enough for reasonably rigid
solids that can be positioned and fingerprinted. I
think it would be more difficult for other items.
Like a sweater. The exact pattern of threads is never
quite the same, with the loose weave and all. The
problem of automatically capturing any object's look,
adequately to uniquely identifying it later, is still
open research.

 If you think you can survive it, please fight... When I found that patent I
found others that were just common sense, things that any geek could implement
with his script/shell-language of choice; and it's time for someone to get the
medias attention on what's going on.
 Basically this is the new wave of ""namenappers""; it used to be domainnames,
not it's all the basic general ideas they can think off/find on the web that
they're patenting.

If the situation in Egypt is anything
like the situation in the Philippines,
it's because people (due to a strange
desire for jobs) squat on land which
they don't own.*

For people to be able to buy their own
land, capitalism must be healthy, but
not triumphant; there need to be too
many capitalists, not too few.

(how well off were the major landowners
in india before independence?)

-Dave

* In the US, we are not so friendly to
our capitalists: adverse possession is
only supposed to take 5 years.

(How much do we owe to our frontiers?
Heck, in Egypt didn't they pretty much
invent geometry a few millenia ago to
keep track of their property lines?)

It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.

Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected

Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?  Does it really make it

Despite that, this is how a lot of couples meet.
People tease me about Carolyn, that I just hired
a lot of software engineering babes, and then
chose the one I liked best. ;-)

Actually, you use both.

No, even best supercapacitors are a long way to go from reasonably good 
electrochemical energy sources. But you can recharge and discharge them 
very quickly, and they take lots more of cycles than the best battery. 
Ideal for absorbing the braking energy and turn them into smoking tires 
few moments or minutes afterwards.

I don't see any reason why EVs shouldn't dominate dragster runs. The
traction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put
the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice
into them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty
of time to smoke anything.

Of course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.",0,0

Morten Frederiksen has taken a first stab at a real-time social network 
explorer based on FOAF files. You could start on my profile[1] and explore from 
there, or enter the URL of your own FOAF file (at the bottom of the page). It's 
heavy on tech details, but you can easily see the potential here. (It's also a 
great way to debug your FOAF file, if you added anything manually.) Now we need 
somebody to build a spider that follows foaf:knows links and draws pretty 
social network diagrams, so we can see the forest for the trees.

 Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

Mutt interacts with smtpdaemon or something like that doesn't it?

Can mutt interact directly with SMTP server with authentication
capabilities? I don't think it can. 

Surely you can just run a mailserver on your own machine and send
mail using it?

fdisk /mbr will restore a dos MBR.. it'll leave the partitions alone.

linux fdisk and deleting all partitions will actually leave LILO in the
MBR though.

Personally, I don't know where you got that from.  Here's how I
grokked the whole piece.   A theory (in this case, that fantasy was
the propagating force/drive?) behind a given act, that from those not
in the fantasy seems morally outrageous, repugnant or unjustified.
He listed many examples, oldies and goodies.   I don't think the
author meant to come off at the point that you seem to be
conjecturing -- that this is purely an 'other' offense.   I certainly
didn't read it that way, but it _did_ bother me that he did not
include some of the examples I listed, or as Damien? mentioned on an
earlier post, the whole collective fantasy of capitalism.

GLM> one carried the ""infection"" the ""plague"" (note, not the ""antigen"" or
GLM> the ""hormone"", which have similar metaphoric effects to philosophy,
GLM> but they chose the fear-charged words)

This article never got into the bones & blood of what humans are Gary.
  You're assuming too much, dearie.  His was all a psychological game.
I'd be willing to wager that, his point was merely psychological.
That there is a distinguishing characteristic (the fantasy) about
those who are perpetually deluded into a preconceived notion of how
the world needs to work -- his examples were very clear -- a
psychopathological individual and on a lesser extreme, the father who
fantasizes his son as a football player.   I kinda read 'levels' into
that distinguishing characteristic though.   Meaning, just because
you believe in the/a fantasy, does not mean necessarily that you're
going to be an evil terrorist.   It just means you're playing alittle
game in your head, and because of that you are a bit different from
the rest of the wavelengths floating around in the cosmos at that
moment.



GLM> ""Make no mistake about it"" it oozes rhetorical vehicles to obfuscate
GLM> it's lack of bits paragraph after paragraph in pushing an agenda to
GLM> /excuse/ ""our"" violence and suspension of human rights to 'clense'
GLM> ourselves of ""them"", the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects of its
GLM> hate.


I didn't read cleanse or nonhuman anywhere.   Mind telling me where
you saw those words?   Sure, I'll bite that the article had rhetoric.
I'll also bite that he wasn't fair entirely with his theory.   If he
meant it to be a universal (capable of including even the common
father with a football complex dream) he should have included our
delusions in all of this.   But honestly, where in the hell did you
get 'cleanse ourselves of 'them', the 'non-human' (or lesser-human)
objects... ?

GLM> What else shall we call it?  Just anti-liberal?  

Lots of things can be anti-liberal and not be bad.  :)

GLM> Better question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour
GLM> are the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact
GLM> more like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? 

Well, as sinister as the schoolboard is, they didn't go kill 4k+
people.   Lets put some of this moral relativism de jour into
perspective here.   Al'Qaeda had a fantasy.  This fantasy involved a
whole mess of 'others' not in their collective fantasy.   This _is_
much like the mafia's collective fantasy about brotherhood and
organized crime, or the biker gang's fantasy about being badasses on
the road or the school board's fantasy about indoctrinating your
children with Jesus, but its not equivalent.

The terrorists went out, and purposely destroyed things, and killed
people.   This is bad, I don't care what universe you're in.   While
the aspect of 'fantasy' can be applied to all groups, and that label
can be equivalent, the perpetration of the fantasy has different
effects and must be judged differently.   Otherwise, whats a genocide?
Just a father-son complex gone terribly awry?

GLM> What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima
GLM> gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this
GLM> planet?  

They just may, that doesn't dispute that their fantasy was a deadly
one.

GLM> What if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like
GLM> our own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for
GLM> trade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make
GLM> it all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/
GLM> /identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs ""fundamentalist islam"",
GLM> and they call ours ""imperialist satanism""?

GLM> When both sides can call the other ""evil"" to the cheers of their local
GLM> public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.

So your whole point is we too live in a fantasy.  Sure.   No
questions.  Its the thing that bothered me about the article.   I
think the difference between our fantasy and theirs, is that there are
folks out there, in our fantasy allowed to voice their opinons about
the 'fantasy' and keep folks a bit grounded in the real versus the
made-up.   From what I gather, there are no such guards, or
protections on their end.   Thats the problem with some regeimes over
others.   THey all have bad points -- Ours is in a collective fantasy
that we need to control the oil, masking the intentions behind a very
clever, albiet convienent other fantasy of 'terrorism'.   Point is,
Gary, the 'terrorism' fantasy really happened.  People really died.
I won't argue we're innocent in the perpetration of our fantasy, but
I'll argue that we're not just blindly 'cleansing' 'non-humans'.

GLM> I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I
GLM> understand, but I really just don't 'get' people.

Too bad bears and racoons don't protect you from the silly fantasies
of people, yours or others.

Joe Berry <joe@topshot.com>,razor-users@example.sourceforge.net,"Wed, 24 Jul 2002 08:02:32 -0400",[Razor-users] Something wrong with Database?,"Until a few days ago, razor (sdk 2.03, client 2.12) was catching a
decent set of spams.  It seems now, however, that it isn't catching
anything.  I got one email this morning with ""ADV:"" in the subject
another two or three about how many inches longer I can be.  Did I
miss something recently perhaps regarding configuration changes, etc?

Thanks in advance,

Joe
