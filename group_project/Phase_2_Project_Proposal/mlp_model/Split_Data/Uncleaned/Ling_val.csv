re : 3 . 405 languages,"in the context of "" who speaks languages ? "" let me comment on how one becomes a linguist . michael kac writes : > i suspect , though i am not sure , that you could take this even further . my > experience suggests that most linguists get interested in the field as the > result of a second language learning experience - - or at least that such an > experience has an important influence on them . this might be true for many linguists . i would like to generalize this observation : it seems to me that many linguists have entered the field because at some point in their lives they have had trouble with using language or with communication in general . this could have been while learning a ( first or ) second language . this could have been because of growing up in a multi-language environment or because of a physical handicap such as stutter . linguistics then serves as a ( formal ) tool to compensate for this deficiency . i can vividly remember how i struggled with german punctuation rules in 6th grade and how i felt relieved when i began to understand the structure of sentences and how this knowledge could be applied to find the correct spot for commas , etc . this started my interested in linguistics and that is how i ended up as a ( computational ) linguist . i 'd be very interested to learn if there is more evidence for my hypothesis . martin volk * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * martin volk * university koblenz - landau tel ( + 49 ) 261-9119 - 469 * institute of computational linguistics * rheinau 3 - 4 fax ( + 49 ) 261-37524 * w-5400 koblenz , germany email volk @ brian . uni-koblenz . de * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

facial information processing,"call for papers pragmatics & cognition announces a special issue on facial information processing : a multidisciplinary perspective guest editors itiel e . dror and sarah v . stevenage in many senses , faces are at the center of human interaction . at a very basic level , faces indicate identity . however , faces are remarkably rich information carriers . for example , facial gestures may be used as means of conveying intentions . faces may also permit a direct glimpse into the person 's inner self ( by unintentionally revealing , for example , aspects of character or mood ) . given their salient role , the processing of the information conveyed by faces and its integration with other sources of interactional information raise important issues in cognition and pragmatics . research on facial information processing has investigated these ( and other ) issues utilizing a variety of approaches and methodologies , and developments in both computer and cognitive sciences have recently carried this research forward . the emerging picture is that there are cognitive subsystems which specialize in different aspects of facial processing . this has been supported by neuropsychological evidence suggesting that brain damaged patients show dissociations between the different aspects of face processing . in addition , research on the development of facial processing abilities , and on aspects of the face itself which affect these processing abilities , has contributed to our understanding of how facial information is perceived . this special issue of pragmatics and cognition is intended to provide a common forum for a variety of the topics currently under investigation . given the breadth of issues and approaches used to investigate faces , we encourage submissions from a wide range of disciplines . our aim is that this special issue will tie together the diverse research on faces , and show their links and interdependencies . deadline for submission : august 1 , 1998 editorial decisions : november 1 , 1998 revised papers due : february 1 , 1999 expected publication : october 1999 papers should be submitted according to the guidelines of the journal ( see www url : http : / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / guideline . html ) . all submissions will be peer reviewed . please send five copies of your submission either to : dr . itiel dror ( dror @ coglab . psy . soton . ac . uk ) or : dr . sarah stevenage ( svs1 @ soton . ac . uk ) dept . of psychology southampton university highfield , southampton so17 1bj england for additional and updated information see www url : http : / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / faces . html or contact either of the guest editors .

re : sapir - whorf and what to tell students these days,"here 's what i tell my undergrad and grad students about that same chapter in language files . i . e . , it 's difficult to even judge what 's going on with whorf unless you are simultaneously conversant with linguistics , american indian languages , and at least the insights of modern physics . first , the conclusion that is appropriate is that , as i showed in "" the demise of the whorf hypothesis "" ( berkeley linguistics society , 1978 ? ) , what whorf said has little or generally no relation whatever to the entire body of discussion that comes under the name "" ( sapir - ) whorf hypothesis "" . he showed decades before the critics came up with their own hypotheses , which they failed to name after themselves , that he would never have agreed with their characterization of his thoughts . simple test : read the lf chapter and then ask , "" who created the whorf hypothesis ? "" and a quick way to answer this is : what did whorf himself call it in his two or three references ? he called it the "" principle of linguistic relativity "" or the "" linguistic relativity principle "" . my own reading of whorf never finds the word "" hypothesis "" at all . so - - right off the bat , and this is a good way to teach scientific nomenclature , who turned whorf 's ' principle ' into a ( n ) ' hypothesis ' , and why ? it was n't whorf , because his designation was clear . so what is the difference between the two ? well , a principle is like an axiom in geometry : a starting point which is theoretically unverifiable - - it 's just a starting point . you want something else , you begin from a different starting point , and then you develop your hypotheses from there . next : what does whorf 's "" linguistic relativity principle "" have to do , if anything , with einstein 's "" relativity principle "" ( which i covered in my also bls , 1980 ? , paper , "" is whorf 's relativity einstein 's relativity ? "" ) . ah , now we ' ve gotten to the crux of it - - much against pinker 's stand ( which was copied and intensified in a lingua franca short bio of suzette elgin hayden recently , where a digression found its author saying that whorf cobbled together his theory from a few ill-translated snatches of apache - - echoing a pinker statement and relying on pinker 's quoting whorf correctly , which he did n't , about a canoe on a beach pointwise : which pinker identified as an apache sentence , but which whorf knew quite well was nootka in the pacific northwest rather than apache in the beachless desert ) , whorf was upping the ante on einstein , who argued that euclidian geometry , far from being universal , was applicable only to flat surfaces ; that for round surfaces , which most of reality is made up of , you need non - euclidian geometry . i . e . , when the phenomena change significantly , you have to change the tool you ' re using . well , that 's what whorf said too ( see heisenberg 's lament below ) , except he moved its domain from mathematics to natural human language ; hence : the truly aptly named "" principle of linguistic relativity "" as whorf himself named it . admittedly , this does n't make any sense until you see it in action , in "" an american indian model of the universe , "" where he posits a worldview without our tense / time ( past / present / future diorama or river of time ) , using manifested / manifesting ( plus other synonyms ) instead . that is : sae grammars / cultures give that aforementioned notion of "" time "" , which is supported and maintained by their tense systems ( though , admittedly , english is weird and gets it through the culture side of the language / culture system ) ; the hopi language / culture system has no such image of time , working from a different worldview principle that sees only cyclical , not linear , time - - round , not flat . most of the world 's grammars that have broken out of the latinate mold show that the particular time / tense system of sae is pretty much peculiar to western european languages - - hence a linguistic / cultural ontology of "" time "" as we know and practice it , and not the supposed universal we have so fondly believed it to be . side note : for one who reads whorf closely , he makes five or ten times more universalist statements than relativity statements in his writings , yet he is seen ( and reviled in a chomskyan universalist attitude ) as the relativist par excellent . so right from the get-go we see that 1 ) whorf did n't write and would n't agree with the hypothesis that someone ( s ) named after him ; 2 ) rather than being some deranged crackpot , he was merely literate : whorf was one of the few interdisciplinary thinkers between physics and linguistics in this century ; 3 ) whorf 's relativity principle had something important to do with einstein 's ; and 4 ) whorf was a universalist as well as a relativist - - he just had them in balance , a notable enough rarity in current academe , you must admit . if i may be so bold , alluding to your posting that "" no one has disproved whorf 's mild version of linguistic relativity ( let 's leave ling . determinism aside , or the stronger version . ) "" , even the mild version was n't his ! trace back like i did and you will find that whorf espoused neither strong nor weak versions of determinism , and relativity has nothing to do with determinism when you see it from the physics viewpoint above , as he did . if you read carefully , writers about the whorf hypothesis admit that even whorf did n't hold a strong version of determinism ( so if he did n't , who did ? and if nobody did , why bring it up ? ) , and that all the critics hold the weak version that they dreamed up ( even though whorf would n't hold it because it 's at least weakly deterministic and therefore newtonian ) . so what 's going on ? the problem is that whorf had already , from his acquaintance with physics , moved from newtonian monocausal determinism as an ideal into systems thinking - - where sometimes the opposite of one profound truth is another profound truth , where everything is interdependent , multicausal , interconnected : language shapes culture while culture is shaping language ; language shapes thinking while thinking is shaping language . the cumulative effect of the ( humboldt / boas / sapir - ) whorf hypothesis literature has been primarily to throw up a smokescreen around his ideas so that people , including grad students in linguistics , psychology , anthropology and sociology , won't read him in the original ( english ! ) . i tell my grad students that if they want to really find out what their discipline is about , go find out who their discipline is beating up on and read them ; and if you are so lucky as me to find someone that four major academic disciplines are ganging up on - - you know you ' ve hit a goldmine ! what in the world could be so important that four academic disciplines create a combined smokescreen ? because so few linguists in this century have availed themselves of the changes in thinking about reality that physics has been broadcasting during this entire century , few linguists are even qualified to step into what they did n't realize was an interdisciplinary debate in the history of ideas which whorf felt so comfortable in . i ' ll explain . i ' ll give you a synopsis of a talk i intend to give at a 100th birthday conference for benjamin whorf , which i intend to get funding for and hold in the bay area in spring 1997 . i call it "" heisenberg 's lament . "" you see , early in this century , that ' uncertain ' heisenberg was among the first to gain a ' glimpse ' into the subatomic world ; and , having done so , he rendered his opinion that , regarding the subatomic realm , "" we have reached the limits of our language . "" he said this for two reasons : 1 ) no matter how glibly western scientists talk about electrons , protons , neutrons , quarks , etc . , when we look into that realm there are no ' things ' , only processes and relationships ; but in order to make sense ( i . e . , complete sentences ) in sae languages , we need nouns - - and there 's nothing in the subatomic realm that you can , except willy-nilly , attach nouns to . and 2 ) given that , our most fundamental scientific terms such as "" same "" and "" different "" are useless . he did n't know then , and physics does n't know now , whether there are gazillions of electrons or just one electron with gazillions of manifestations . we have reached the limits of our language . fast - forward a few decades and whorf hears this in his physics classes at yale ( he has unpublished manuscripts on gravity in the yale archives ) , and ponders : hm , i wonder if this has anything to do with what prof . sapir said the other day about hopi not needing nouns to express ordinary propositions - - just "" rehpi "" , "" flashed "" , instead of "" it "" or "" the / a light flashed "" : because when you come right down to it , how is the flashing different from the light ? is "" light "" just a convenient grammatical fiction foisted upon us by sae grammar ? and as he pondered ' light ' being noun or verb , particle or wave , depending on how it 's viewed , he saw the universe in the same way , with different cultures taking different positions on the question . in this case , since hopi did n't seem to take too seriously the absence of nouns , perhaps , whorf surmised , hopi could be of use for physicists in exploring and reporting back about the quantum world , that realm that did n't have thingy nouns . fast - forward another few decades and physicist david bohm reads whorf ( which i confirmed personally in talking to him ) , and then , * in response * ( my attribution ) , writes _ wholeness and the implicate order _ , in which he , among other things , tries to make english more verby and performative in the "" rheomode "" - - a brilliant flop ; and then launches on the scientific community a view of the universe which does not contain our familiar notions of past / present / future time , but instead an implicate and explicate order of reality - - an "" inny / outty "" notion where the future is inside us working outward instead of some vague distant goal we are headed toward . an email acquaintance pointedly asked me what the difference was between bohm 's terminology and whorf 's terminology ; it took me 6 months to finally answer that there was none , except the hopis had had theirs for millennia longer . and then it hit me ! bohm , in his own maverick way , appropriated whorf 's answer to heisenberg 's lament in "" an american indian model of the universe "" and substituted more scientifically acceptable terminology ( implicate / explicate rather than manifesting / manifested ) to see how the notion of a universe without linear time would fly in the modern physics and academic community - - and it had qualified success . but - - bohm was no closer to knowing whether whorf had been accurate in his description of hopi than he had been before writing the book . and there had been so much bad press on the guy ! how was one to know , ultimately ? and here 's the part that almost no-one knows so far . in 1991 , in the last few months of his life , david bohm launched his most ambitious thought experiment to date : with some other physicists and a few psychologists and linguists , and sponsored by the fetzer institute , he enticed recognized american indian intellectual leaders ( and some of their elders ) to join in dialogue together in what i can only describe as a roundabout way of asking american indians whether whorf was accurate in his description of the ' timeless ' hopi worldview . but it became so much more ! the american indian leaders there had previously read bohm 's book and others , but the physicists knew nothing about native american worldviews and native american science methodologies , so the indians had to build a bridge over to them in private meetings before the three public days on the themes of time , space and language . during the day on time , whorf 's description of hopi came up , was read out loud , and discussed , though i do n't remember any hopis being present ; nevertheless , the other american indians present , mostly of algonquian tribes , gave what can only be called ' independent verification ' in scientific terminology by saying essentially : well , i can't speak for the hopi people , but that 's pretty much the way we do it . in fact , of the many whorf passages read or discussed in these dialogues , the physicists and the american indians present were usually willing to give whorf his points ( proving again , perhaps , the difficulty of being a prophet in one 's own country / discipline ! ) . but we ' re not done yet - - the best is yet to come - - the actual conclusion of heisenberg 's lament ! at the beginning of the first dialogue it was clear that the quantum physicists had their favorite realm to explore and talk about , and the american indians also had their own favorite realm . as we dialogued , it began becoming clear that those favorite realms had some fundamental principles in common : the only constant is flux ; everything that exists vibrates ; everything is interconnected such that the part implicates the whole . in fact , it became crystal clear that the last major obstacle to these realms being the same realm was really only terminological : the physicists are used to calling it "" the subatomic realm "" whereas the american indians for millennia have been calling it "" the spirit realm "" . now that 's a big enough surprise - - that modern physics is knocking on the door of spirit without really meaning to - - but not big enough , so now let 's take it home ! it puzzled the physicists just how the american indians should have foreknowledge of a realm they should n't know about , that the western scientific infrastructure had just recently led us to - - and the indians had no such scientific infrastructure ! and as the physicists gradually understood that , like hopi , the algonquian grammatical structures do not demand nouns , do not demand fictitious actors to embody actions ( that , as my mikmaq and blackfoot friends tell me , they can talk all day long in those languages and never utter a single ' noun ' ! ) , they finally had to admit that such languages were indeed much better suited to exploring that realm and reporting back than sae languages - - whorf 's reply to heisenberg 's lament was verified and agreed upon . when the phenomena of reality change in a dramatic way , you need to change the tool you ' re using . now , of course , the physicists were left with an even larger puzzle , to wit : how is it that these american indians have a language much better suited than sae languages to investigate and describe the inner workings of the subatomic realm - - a realm they are n't even supposed to know about ! ? ! as you can see by now , pinker - - like all other facile critics and unindicted co-creators of the so-called hypothesis - - is out of his league altogether in attempting to characterize a major player in one of the most important interdisciplinary discussions ever in the history of ideas . pinker , like chomsky , loves logic ( which grows out of the grammar of sae languages just as the philosophy of ' karma ' grew out of the grammar of ancient sanskrit , where it was used earliest as the linguistics term for 'd irect object ' ! ! ) , but has never really gotten with the program this century to replace binary / dualistic thinking with multivariable / multicausal / interdependent systems thinking . whorf heard the call , way back then , and may yet prove to have been an entire century ahead of his time in linguistics . even though we can think in systems for phonology and grammar , we have a tough time doing it for "" language and thought "" ; we feel we have to make them bipolar opposites such that they are distinct and one causes the other invariantly ; that 's why i so admired how slobin finally lost those monolithic terms and framed the question instead in terms of "" thinking for speaking "" - - the at least one kind of thinking where your thinking is very much at the mercy of the forms and categories of your language , per whorf . so tell your students , as i do , that the only way to get to the bottom of what whorf did or did not say is to read his essays in _ language , thought & reality _ for themselves , perhaps with the above thoughts as a guideline , and then figure out for themselves whether the sapir - whorf hypothesis smokescreen makes any sense .

disc he / she,"dear linguist list subscribers , for the continuing discussion of the pronouns , i have some lines of data from the 17 manuscripts of the a - version of piers plowman . they can generally be said to be representative of 15th century usage . is it not strongly suggested in the lines that "" proverbial he "" , and perhaps the "" original "" morphology of the so called "" generic-he "" , was feminine , not masculine ? what a strange thing to say ! can this be accurate ? looking at the middle english pronouns , using the modern paradigm to evaluate them , is misleading and inconclusive . when the development of middle english "" his "" or "" him "" is evaluated without taking into consideration their development from old english morphology , much of the story is lost - - that these two "" masculine "" forms were also neuter , and in this later sense ( "" not one or the other "" ) , served well for the indefinite singular - - by way of development from the oe masculine / neuter obliques ; and the feminine forms were morphologically related to the plural . in the following lines , the h-stem subject is the feminine ( / plural ) , not the masculine . am i wrong ? ( playing for a moment the devil 's advocate ) do n't these lines below fly in the face of feminist theory as it sees the "" he "" "" stealing cognitive space "" , whereas in fact , they are feminine forms ? i would like to have some feminist theory input about these lines of evidence . if so-goes - the-language , so-goes - the-culture ( a la whorf ) , what can we make of the "" hers "" = 3d "" theirs "" identity found widespread in middle english morpholgy , and what can we say about the "" proverbial he "" in the following being feminine ? is there anybody strong in feminist theory , particulary a feminist him - / herself , who can discuss this in the general forum ? is my understanding correct that feminist history sees the h-stem feminine as having dropped from living english by 1300 ? please help . do not hesitate to contact me personally about any aspects of this , pro , con , or indifferent . lines from piers ( * = 3d unavailable character ) passus iii line 229 a = ch and he = feat gripeth gifts , so [ ? ] god helpe , d and ho so gripeth here gifts , so me god helpe , e = deai = feat grypi = fe such gifts , sa me god helpe , h but he = feat gripeth siche 3eftis , so me god helpe , h2 and he = feat grypes here gifts , so me god helpe , h3 = j and he = feat gripi = fe mede , so me god helpe , k and thay = feat grepyn her gifts , so me god helpe , l and ho = feat gripeth heore 3eftes , so me god helpe , m and 3e = feat grypit here 3iftis , so me god helpe , n and he = feat gripeth 3e gift , so me god helpe , r and he = feat grypyt 3oure gifts , so me god helpe , t and he = feat gripi = fe here gifts , so me god helpe , u and he = feat gripeth here gold , so me god helpe , v and heo = feat 3iftus heore gifts , so me god helpe , w he = feat gripeth here 3eftes , so me god helpe passus iii line 230 a schul ab * e it full bitterly or ellis = fee bok lyeth ch shal ab * e bitterly or = fee bok lie * th d shal ab * e it bitterly or = fee bok lyeth e sall ab * e it full bytter as = fee buke tellis h he schal abigge it bitterly or ellis = fee bok li * e = fe h2 shal ab * e it biterly or = fee bok lyeth h3 shal ab * e it bitterly or = fee bok li * e = fe j schulun abugge wel bitterly or = fee bok lyeth k schallen abigge hit wel bitterly or = fee bok lyeth l shal ab * e hit wel bytter or ellis = fee bok lyeth m scholyn abiggyn wol bytter or = fee bok liet n shal ab * e hit wel bitterly ar = fee bok lyeth r shal ab * e ful bitterly or = fee bok lyes t shal ab * ie it bitterly or = fee bok li * e = fe u shal ab * e ful bitere or = fee bok lyes v = deei schullen abugge bitterly or = fee bok li * e = fe w shal ab * e it bitterly or = fee bok ly

"" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash !

! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it !

do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders !

dislocations,"content - length : 4400 - - - - - - - - - - forwarded message - - - - - - - - - - date mon , 19 jun 1995 08 : 10 : 48 - 0400 > from aaa552 @ agora . ulaval . ca subject / graviton / einstein / aaa552 / mail / bb i posted a week ago a query on the topic of dislocation . i wanted to know whether just any of the phenomena known by the name of dislocation implies coreference . the responses to the posting indicated that the word dislocation is by and large used to refer to a phrase p adjoined to a sentence s where p holds a coreference relationship with a pronoun included in s . so there seems to exist a terminological consensus on this notion ( although for some dislocation covers topicalization ) . here is a very slightly edited summary of responses . many thanks to all those whose responded . i hope this is useful . pierre larrivee . w . croft @ manchester . ac . uk ( bill croft ) : i think you will have to define "" dislocation "" to get a useful answer from your query - - - in particular , define it in such a way that the coreference relation does not follow by definition . if "" dislocation "" means what the etymology suggests , then it involves movement of an element out of its canonical position ; if you allow coreference to phonologically null elements ( left in canonical position ) , then by definition a dislocated element will have a coreference relation to an element in the sentence to which it is adjoined , namely to the null or non-null element it has "" left behind "" . if you do not allow coreference to phonologically null elements , then the english construction called "" topicalization "" or "" y - movement "" is a counterexample to the generalization you are inquiring about . if you define "" dislocation "" in a non-movement fashion - - - i . e . as some element ( an np ? ) adjoined to a sentential constituent - - - then japanese , chinese and other e asian languages ' topic constructions will be a counter - example , since the "" topic "" np need not be an argument or even an adjunct of the sentence to which it is adjoined . to this comment of mine : it seems to me that topicalization is a somewhat different phenomena from dislocation , is it not ? cf . the prosody ( no pause for topics ) and the lack ( in general ) of a resumptive pronoun ( chocolate cake i like ( * it ) ) . w . croft added : prosody would be an interesting start on a definition of dislocation that does n't presuppose coreference - - - i think the resumptive pronoun part is more problematic , since specifying the form of a resumptive form would presuppose coreference . > from holleb @ linguist . umass . edu ( ? ? bart holle ) at the moment i am working on right dislocation , mainly in dutch . and as far as i can tell there are no counterexamples . the moment there is no reference to an element in the "" main "" clause it is clearly extraposition . a main difference for dutch is that you can extract out of an extraposed phrase , whereas you cannot out of right dislocated one . > from sophie . kern @ mrash . fr ( sophie kern ) i ' m actually writting my thesis about the development of narrative competence by french monolingual children ( 3 to 11 years old using ) a picture book task . one of the domain i ' m studying is the reference to the main or other characters of the story , and particulierly what kind of linguistic devices the children use to maintain or to switch reference in subject position i found a lot of left and right dislocations . > from larry horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu ) you might want to check out an old paper by robert rodman on topicalization and ld in a journal called papers in linguistics . i think it was 1973 . he talks about sentences like : as for noxious odors , my sheepdog farts after eating escargots . in which the sentence is a comment on the topic in the "" ld "" phrase , but no coreference per se obtains . > from barrett @ zelig . cs . nyu . edu ( leslie barrett ) there 's an article by bowers in li ( 1993 ) that mainly concerns predication but mentions coreference possibilities in fronted vps like the following : criticize himself , i think john never will i i ) from luge . latrobe . edu . au ( hussein shokouhi ) ronald geluykens has extensively worked on this issue in english . he has published a book in 1992 under the title of ' from grammar to discourse : left-dislocated construction ' . knud lambrescht has also done something on french . he has also published a book on french discourse and syntax in 1994 . surely , you can find a good number of references in those two books .

call workshop optionality,"- call for papers - call for papers - call for papers - the research institute for language and speech ( ots ) , utrecht university , organizes a . . . . . workshop on optionality to be held on september 1 - 2 , 1995 . keynote speakers : jane grimshaw ( rutgers ) tony kroch ( penn ) tanya reinhart ( tel aviv / utrecht ) edwin williams ( princeton ) in the history of generative linguistics , there has been a shift from construction-specific rules to general principles . in the minimalist framework of chomsky ( 1993 ) , movement is argued to be a last resort operation : it may only take place if it is triggered , that is , if movement is required to escape ungrammaticality . this concept , which gradually took shape in the late eighties ( cf . travis 1986 ) , is referred to as "" economy "" . now , although economy is conceptually attractive , it faces serious problems when confronted with optional movements : by hypothesis , a movement is blocked if it does not have to take place . optionality is widely attested in natural language . one might even claim that there are situations in which it is typical that two or more variants of a construction coexist . in this workshop we would like to explore in what ways the problem of optionality can be approached . one would like to have a theory that predicts which types of optionality may be expected in natural language . we would therefore like to invite papers that deal with the theoretical problem of optionality . papers may focus on optionality in the steady state or on optionality in situations of language acquisition and language change . in addition to 4 ( invited ) keynote talks , we have 12 slots for 35 min . papers . please send 5 copies of an anonymous two-page abstract , one camera-ready version and a 3x5 "" card with name ( s ) of author ( s ) , title of paper , affiliation , phone number and e-mail address to : workshop on optionality , research institute for language and speech ( ots ) , utrecht university , trans 10 , 3512 jk utrecht , netherlands . we hope to be able to ( partially ) reimburse speakers . the deadline for submissions is may 1 , 1995 . submissions by e-mail or fax will not be accepted . for further information contact neeleman @ let . ruu . nl or weerman @ let . ruu . nl .

ecology of language acquisition,"ecology of language acquisition international research workshop university of amsterdam , netherlands 11 - 15 january 1999 second announcement and call for papers ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ this workshop re-examines certain assumptions implicit in much language acquisition research to date , such as the primacy of the one-speaker - one-hearer interaction ; a static interpretation of ' context ' and participant roles ; and the presupposition of a monolingual / monocultural social matrix . the focus of the meeting is thus the complexity of circumstances in which the language acquirer operates , addressed in such questions as : * how should discourse-analytic and anthropological descriptions of communicative interaction be integrated to account not only for ' conversation ' , multi-party and ritual talk , but also man-machine interaction and forms of virtual participation in the networks of cyberspace ? * how should the notion of 's hared context ' be extended to capture the floor shifts and on-line construction of meaning that take place over the progress of an unfolding discourse ? * how can theories of acquisition be made more sensitive to complex linguistic and sociocultural environments that are to varying degrees plural , mixed , and in flux ? the intention is to bring together people and paradigms from l1 and l2 acquisition research with the aim of exploring from an empirical base how the multiple contexts of language acquisition are interrelated , and how , with ecosystemic validity , such interrelations may be theoretically modelled . in the planning of the programme the organizers are assisted by a scientific advisory board consisting of eve clark ( max planck insitute / stanford ) , claire kramsch ( berkeley ) , leo van lier ( monterey ) , ben rampton ( thames valley ) and remco scha ( amsterdam ) - all of whom have also agreed to contribute keynote talks . if you would like to propose a paper , please send in an abstract ( maximum 300 words ) by e-mail before 30 april . the address is : ecolang @ hum . uva . nl ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ although we are obliged to limit ' real ' participation to 30 people , we are making provision for a form of remote partial participation via e-mail ( with possible audio links ) . if you think you will be interested in participating in either capacity , please let us know by e-mail . the workshop fee ( for "" live "" participants ) will be dfl . 160 ( approximately us $ 75 ) . the workshop is organized by jet van dam , jonathan leather , anne bannink ( faculty of humanities , university of amsterdam ) http : / / www . hum . uva . nl / ~ ecolang

"re : 3 . 386 chomsky , mac concordance","it seems to me that for whatever reasons , the fact that there are so many references to chomsky by non-linguists ( let 's ignore the linguists for now ) shows that the field is at least recognized as a legitimate area of intellectual inquiry - - ( after all , even oxford decided a few years ago that they should have a professor of linguistics - - after a long debate to be sure ) this is a cause for exhaltation - - not snyde remarks or comparisons to stalin and mao . and linguists of whatever stripe or theoretical persuasion should recognize that our newly recognized status is due to a great extent to the advent of generative grammar and chomsky . for various reasons i have met a number of nobel laureates over the last ten to fifteen years , and each one on learning i was a linguist asked "" do you know noam chomsky ? "" and each remarked at some point that he thought chomsky was one of the great intellects in history . a much better response than being asked "" how many languages do you speak ? "" while that may still be the layperson 's view of our field , it is no longer the view among scientists and academicians across the board . vicki fromkin

"" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . everyday for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box !

$ 7 money maker and e - mail service,"please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully . immediately print it and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! ! i didn t believe him , so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed his instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just couldn t believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying please put me on your mailing list and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other s lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed !

help : teaching stress in intro phonetics,"does anybody have any hints on how to help undergrads in an introductory phonetics class learn to hear lexical stress ( that is , to identify the syllable in a word that receives primary stress ) , particulary in ameng ? the two "" helps "" i know are 1 ) say the word several times , over-emphasizing one syllable at a time ( i ' ve just done this by example , using extreme f0 & intensity variation ) . one production should sound reasonably normal and the rest should sound pretty odd ; or 2 ) tap your finger as you say the word ; folks usually tap on the stressed syllable . while most students i ' ve had seem to grasp this fairly quickly , i still have a few who , after numerous examples , look at me as if i ' m being utterly mystical . some of these are non-native speakers of english , but not all . i realize that this question calls up all sorts of issues on the nature of stress and its perception , but before one can address those at all it 's necessary to introduce the concept somehow , and so far my experience has been that introductory discussions of stress in phonetics texts ultimately assume that speakers can pretty reliably "" hear stress "" once the phenomenon is pointed out to them - - that is , that there 's something intuitively obvious about the notion of a stressed syllable . but what about those students / speakers who apparently find nothing intuitive about it ? thanks laura l . koenig ( koenig @ haskins . yale . edu )

currency names - summary,"months ago i sent a question out on the linguist list about some currency names . i got a number of responses , but being both lazy and busy , it has taken me much too long to send out a summary . but now , for those who have - - maybe - - been waiting for it , here it comes . i will not say anything about the scientific value of it , but interesting is it ( it might e . g . be , that all the "" r . . . l "" words are "" after f [ rench ] ( and sp [ anish ] ) models and are indeed cognate with royal "" , and the rupee and the rubl are not related to either the "" r . . . l "" words or each other at all ) . - - i have somewhat shortened the responses , where necessary . veturlidi oskarsson veturosk @ ismal . hi . is - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the request as it was sent on march 27 , 1995 : > does anybody know the etymology of the following currency names : > rial ( iran , oman , north yemen ) > riyal ( saudi arabia , quatar ) > riel ( cambodia ) > real ( brazil ) > and maybe other similar names beginning with ri / re end ending with l ? > would it be possible that those names are of the same ( ie . ) origin , > originally refering to kingdom e . t . c .

' gold ingots were originally * chopped * into small ( eventually , circular ) pieces and used as coins . in contemporary russian , the past passive participle of this verb is * rublennyj * ( e . g . , * rublennoe mjaso * ' chopped meat ' ) . gary h . toops wichita state university 5 . response : "" real "" in portuguese / spanish is cognate with "" royal "" and "" regal . "" my hunch is because it was currency backed by the crown , but it 's a hunch . it would be interesting to be able to do something like prove that the spanish / portuguese used the term ' real , ' which was picked up by the moors and carried with islamic invaders into se asia . also difficult . the russian "" rubl ' "" is a bit more than a hunch - - it derives from the word for "" cut "" : rubit ' ' to cut ' , and other words . check out fasmer 's ( vasmer 's ) etymological dictionary , available in german or russian . i was told by a slavic professor that this is cognate to "" rupee , "" but the guy was going around the bend and could easily be wrong on that point . t . beasley ucla 6 . response : the rial words are all originally "" after f [ rench ] ( and sp [ anish ] ) models "" and are indeed cognate with royal . in england a gold coin of this name was issued in 1465 , and there were french , spanish and scottish coins of the same name over the 15 and 16c . the name seems to have travelled with the maritime empires . dollar also has a complicated history . starting as the english version of thaler ( a coin of the german states ) it then was used for the large spanish coin ( worth 8 reales ) of spain . because of the importance of the spanish maritime influence and of its currency , the term became very widespread and was used ( even in parts of the british empire , such as the straits settlements - - we still use dollars here in singapore ) in many places , including in the us . you cannot assume that the use of dollar is a sign of american influence . rupee is different , coming from a sanskrit word for silver , it is of indian origin . anthea fraser national university of singapore 7 . response : according to vasmer 's etymological dictionary of russian , rubl ' ( gen . sg . rublj ' a ( stress on ending ) ) shares a root with the verb rubit ' ' hack ' and meant ' hacked off piece of a grivna ( larger unit of currency ) ' . gladney 8 . response : russian rubl ' is not related to rial / real . it comes from a root meaning ' cut ' . the origin of the term is from silver bars from which sections were clipped off ( otrubit ' in russian ) and used as currency . i remember visiting a church in moscow dedicated to the ' cut-off head of john the baptist ' ( otrublennoj golove ioanna predtechy ) . btw kopejka ( 1 \ 100 of a rubl ' ) means 's mall spear / lance ' and comes from the depiction of st . george killing the dragon which was the symbol printed on it . the russian word for money - 'd en ' gi ' - is of turkic origin and is one of several in the russian language coming from a turkic root meaning 's tamp ' . incidentally , i ' m pleased to see that the slovenian currency is the toler - one more from dollar . geraint jennings 9 . response : panamanians use the term real for a 5 centavo piece . it was interesting to me because the currency is in balboas & centavos , but , as with american money , this coin had its own name . as far as i know , it was the only coin that had its own name ( i lived there for 11 years ) . it was also a type of test in the marketplace to determine who was "" local "" & who was n't . when the price quoted to me was "" 2 reales "" & i pulled out the exact change , they knew i was n't a tourist ! the word real means royal in spanish , but i do n't know why the 5 centavo piece would be called such . caroline l . steele university of hawaii 10 . response : according to klein ' s comprehensive etymological dictionary of the english language , * rial * , * riyal * are from spanish * real * ( < latin regalem ) to which portuguese * real * is obviously related . i have no info on * riel * . the russian * ruble * and indian * rupee * are not related to the above nor to each other . they both come from indigenous words . marc picard 11 . response : according to the macmillan dictionary of measurement , the first real ( ` royal ' ) was a small silver coin issued by the spanish royal mint . rupya ( > rupee ) is an ancient indian word for ` ( metal made into ) coinage ' , and ruble may be related . dinar comes from latin denarius , a coin worth ten asses ( a word related to ace ) . anton sherwood 12 . response : . . . "" real "" was also the name of a old gold or silver coin in the kingdoms of castile , portugal and aragon ( later in spanish america ) . the first dated ' real ' was coined in castile in the middle of the 14th century . they were called ' real ' because they were coined by the crown , in opposition to local coins coined by bishops , counts and noblemen . according to my sources of information ( enciclopedia larousse - spanish version ) , there were ' reals ' in france too . in the 14th century , the iberian peninsula was divided in several territories : three christian kingdoms : castile , aragon and portugal , and a lot of small moorish kingdoms ( called ' taifas ' ) . it is not unlikely , thus , that the name for the ' real ' had been taken in arabic as ' riyal ' . one curiosity : in contemporary spanish , the sentence ' no tengo un real ' ( literally : i have not a real ) means ' i have not a dime ' ( the same in catalan : no tinc un ral ' ) . j . carlos ruiz universitat jaume i castells 13 . response : in the case of brazil 's real , the currency is named after an old currency which was always referred to in the plural as ' reis ' and ' mirreis ' ( thousands ) . ' real ' means ' royal ' , and so does ' reis ' , i suppose . tony berber sardinha university of liverpool 14 . response : ( translated from icelandic : ) the russian word rubl is in no way related to the "" r . . . l "" currencies . in russian the word is _ rubl ' _ ( ' = palatalization ) , and comes from the verb _ rubit ' _ ' chop , hew ' . the explanation is , as far as i know , that the coin was minted by punching it from a metal plate with a special puncher or stamping iron . the "" l "" is not a suffix , as one could expect , but come from * bj , * mj etc . ( labial cons . + j ) , that changed to * bl ' , * ml ' etc . in proto slavic . so , it is ie . * roubh-jo - s , or something like that , that lies behind the rubl . i do n't know about the arabian word _ ri ( y ) al _ ( which i suspect to have a long a : ) . it could very well be of semitic origin , both the number and and type of root consonants ( r-y - l ) , and "" cv - type "" ( cvcvvc , cf . kita : b ' book ' ) could support that . gunnar ol . hansson 15 . response : hinds and badawi 's dict . of egyptian arabic ( 1986 ) indicates that riyaal , twenty piastres or a twenty-piastre piece , derives from spanish real . kirk belnap brigham young university 16 . response : as far as i , as a layperson , know , the word "" real "" in continental spanish was in fact in use until the begining of the 20th century ( my grandmothers used it , as well as my father , in everyday speech ) . i am not sure what portion of a peseta this amount was ( whether it was a portion of a cent or viceversa , i could ask if you want to know ) . i suspect that , at least the word real in portuguese ( or brazilian ) comes from the spanish one , and as you know , the spanish ' real ' means of course ' royal ' . nuria lopez ortega cornell university - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - thank you all . veturlidi oskarsson",0

new books in syntax & morphology ( 3 titles ),"negation and clausal structure : a comparative study of romance languages raffaella zanuttini , georgetown university ( oxford studies in comparative syntax ) "" zanuttini is absolutely at the cutting edge of research both in romance languages and in theoretical syntax . . . . a significant contribution to the field . "" - - donna jo napoli , swarthmore college every human language has some syntactic means of distinguishing a negative from a non-negative sentence ; in other words , every speaker 's syntactic competence provides a means to express sentential negation . this ability , however , may be expressed in different ways , as shown by the fact that individual languages employ different syntactic strategies for the expression of the same semantic function of negating a sentence . zanuttini 's goal here is to characterize the range of such variation by comparing the different syntactic means for expressing sentential negation exhibited by the members of one language family - - the romance languages - - and by reducing the differences we witness to a constrained set of choices available to the particular grammars of these languages . this sort of analysis is a first step towards the ultimate goal of determining and understanding what limits there are on the syntactic options that universal grammar imposes on the expression of sentential negation . september 1997 216 pp . ; 18 charts 0-19 - 508055 - 6 paper $ 39 . 95 oxford university press clause structure and word order in hebrew and arabic : an essay in comparative semitic syntax ur shlonsky , university of geneva ( oxford studies in comparative syntax ) shlonsky uses chomsky 's government and binding approach to examine clausal architecture and verb movement in hebrew and several varieties of arabic . he establishes a syntactic analysis of hebrew and then extends that analysis to certain aspects of arabic clausal syntax . through this comparative lens of hebrew , shlonsky hopes to resolve a number of problems in arabic syntax . his results generate some novel and important conclusions concerning the patterns of negations , verb movement , the nature of participles , and the gamut of positions available to clausal subjects in both languages . june 1997 304 pp . 0-19 - 510867 - 1 paper $ 45 . 00 0-19 - 510866 - 3 cloth $ 75 . 00 oxford university press tense and aspect : from semantics to morphosyntax alessandra giorgi , university of bergamo , italy , and fabio pianesi , institute for technology and scientific research ( irst ) , trento , italy ( oxford studies in comparative syntax ) this book examines the interactions between the morphosyntax and the semantic interpretation of tense and aspect in the germanic and romance languages . these languages diverge not only in their variety of tense and aspectual forms , but also in the distribution and interpretation of given forms . adopting noam chomsky 's minimalist framework , alessandra giorgi and fabio pianesi attempt to provide theoretical explanations for the observed patterns of form and meaning which link the morphosyntactic properties of languages in both universal and language-particular constraints on interpretation . december 1997 336 pp . 0-19 - 509193 - 0 paper $ 35 . 00 0-19 - 509192 - 2 cloth $ 85 . 00 oxford university press for more information about linguistics titles from oxford university press : e-mail : linguistics @ oup-usa . org or visit the oxford university press usa web site : http : / / www . oup-usa . org oxford university press usa

workshop on semi - lexical heads,"* * call for papers * * workshop on semi-lexical heads tilburg university , thursday 20 may and friday 21 may 1999 invited speakers : joseph emonds ( university of durham ) hubert haider ( university of salzburg ) elisabeth loebel ( university of cologne ) semi-lexical heads the distinction between lexical / major categories , on the one hand , and functional / minor / grammatical categories , on the other , is at the heart of present-day grammatical theory , but plays an equally central role in theories on language acquisition , code switching , aphasia , etcetera . in the course of time , various diagnostic criteria have been proposed which distinguish the one class from the other : e . g . productivity , distribution , lack versus presence of semantic content . although for certain clear-cut cases ( e . g . the distinction between noun and determiner ) , this distinction is quite straightforward , there are many lexical items for which it is less easy to decide whether they side with the lexical categories or with the functional ones . the category p is a well-known case of uncertainty . although it seems less functional in a sense than a determiner , it is more "" grammatical "" than n , v and a . some people have argued that a distinction should be made within the class of prepositions between the lexical ones and the grammatical or functional ones ( cf . van riemsdijk 1990 ; zwarts 1992 ) this gradualness on the lexical-functional "" scale "" is characteristic of other categories as well and is reminiscent of ross 's ( 1972 ; 1973 ) notion of squish , which refers to degrees of nouniness ( or verbiness ) of syntactic categories . emonds ( 1985 ) speaks bout grammatical nouns , verbs , adjectives and prepositions , and also refers to them as disguised lexical categories . another appropriate term would be semi-lexical heads , i . e . heads which are hybrid in the sense that they display both lexical and functional / grammatical characteristics . what kinds of lexical items might possibly be considered semi-lexical ? for the nominal domain , emonds ( 1985 ) refers to such items as the pro-form "" one "" in "" the good ones "" , reflexive "" self "" ( cf . "" selves "" ) , and "" thing "" as it occurs in "" something good "" . classifiers and quantity-designating nominals in pseudopartitive constructions like "" three grains of sand "" might be considered semi-lexical as well . within the verbal domain , semi-lexical candidates might arguably be : auxiliary verbs ( see emonds 85 for this claim ) , certain verbs featuring in verb clusters in germanic verb raising constructions , verbs in serialization constructions , etcetera . within the adjectival domain , one might take such quantifiers as "" many "" , "" few "" , "" much "" as instances of semi-lexical adjectives . the above is just a brief sketch of potential semi-lexical heads . presumably , there are many more . here are some of the more concrete questions that might arise in the study of semi-lexical heads : v what types of semi-lexical nouns , verbs , adjectives and prepositions can be distinguished ? what distinguishes them from truly lexical categories and in what sense are they different from truly grammatical functors ? is this distinction expressed in terms of their lexical feature-composition , and if so , what features are involved ? what is their assembling property ; i . e . how do they combine in syntactic structure and how do they project syntactically ? are they involved in idiosyncratic displacement phenomenona , and if so , what feature of the semi-lexical head triggers this ? what is the licensing function of semi-lexical heads ? what makes them interpretable at the interface levels ? also from a diachronic point of view , the question arises how lexical heads develop gradually into semi-lexical ones . is there cross-linguistic variation in the range of semi-lexical heads and if so , what does this variation reside in ? besides the question of how semi-lexical heads behave in the syntactic component , questions arise about their behavior in other components : are there morphological processes characteristic of semi-lexical heads ? as concerns the lexicon , the question arises how they are stored in the lexicon and what distinguishes their lexical entry from that of truly lexical categories . abstracts : abstracts are invited for 30 minutes talks ( with an additional ten minutes for discussion ) . abstracts should be anonymous , and should be no longer than two pages , including references and examples , with margins of at least 1 - inch , font size 11 / 12 . submissions are limited to a maximum of one individual and one joint abstract per author . please provide 5 anonymous abstracts and one camera-ready original containing title , author 's name and affiliation . submissions by e-mail or fax can be accepted , provided a camera-ready original is received within one week after the deadline . a separate card should contain the title of the paper , author 's name , affiliation , address , telephone number and e-mail address . we have the intention to publish ( a selection of ) the papers . we expect to be able to partially reimburse you for travel and / or vhotel expenses , but precise figures are not available as yet . * * * * * * * * * * * deadline for receipt of abstracts : monday 1 february , 1999 . abstracts should be sent to the following address : norbert corver grammar models group department of linguistics tilburg university p . o . box 90153 5000 le tilburg the netherlands phone : + 31 13 4662773 e - mail : secretariaat . gm . fdl @ kub . nl fax : + 31-13 - 4663110 organizing committee : norbert corver & henk van riemsdijk information about accommodation and travel information will be made available at the grammar models web site , which is accessible at : http : / / cwis . kub . nl / ~ fdl / research / gm / conf . htm

re : original karamojong / jie language,"leo connolly cross-posted a question about karamojong on linguist and sci . lang . i posted a response on sci . lang , and i ' m cross-posting it here . in article ( 1994nov22 . 145346 . 29219 @ msuvx1 . memphis . edu ) , connolly @ cc . memphis . edu writes : ) a colleague of mine would like to know the latest opinion concerning the ) original language of the "" karamojong hordes "" and / or jie , who have abandoned ) their original language in favor of that of the masai . does anyone know ) whether their tongue is best described as "" nilotic "" or "" sudanic "" ? or does n't ) it matter ? and if greenberg classified this language , which se seems to ave ) done , does anyone know if his classification is still generally accepted ( a ) fair question in view of his more recent amerindian debacle ) ? ) bill welmers , in his "" checklist of language and dialect names "" ( sebeok , t . a . , 1971 , current trends in linguistics , vol . 7 : linguistics in sub - saharan africa , the hague : mouton ) lists karamojong as a member of the chari - nile branch of nilo - saharan . in the same volume , greenberg 's article "" nilo - saharan and meroitic "" gives a little more detail , assigning it to the teso group of eastern nilotic , itself a branch of eastern sudanic , which is a branch of chari - nile . its cognate languages within teso are teso , toposa , and turkana . i do n't work on nilo - saharan , so i ' m not up to date on current classification . however , in african languages as a whole , greenberg 's four major families , niger - congo , nilo - saharan , afro - asiatic , and khoi - san have stood up pretty well for the last 30 years . there has been some discussion of a relationship between niger - congo and nilo - saharan , but no convincing case has yet been published . within niger - congo there has been some realignment ( john bendor - samuel , 1991 , the niger - congo languages , university press of america ) , the most significant being the shifting of the benue - congo boundary some 600 or so miles westwards to include what greenberg called eastern kwa . greenberg 's southern cushitic ( afro - asiatic ) is now referred to as omotic and its membership in afro - asiatic seems to be in some doubt . otherwise his african classification works remarkably well . as an africanist who was in graduate school towards the end of the debate on greenberg 's african classification , i see some strong parallels with the amerindian debate . the vehemence , even rancor , of his critics back in the fifties and sixties was no less than what we ' ve seen more recently . it is certainly unfortunate that there is apparently so much flawed data in his american work , something i can't judge but apparently much more than was in his african work , but at the same time his method of mass comparison is more archeological in nature than linguistic and has a remarkably high tolerance for error . i consider the jury still out . flames accepted but probably ignored . herbert stahlke , associate director email : 00hfstahlke @ bsu . edu university computing services phone : 317-285 - 1843 ball state university fax : 317-285 - 1797 muncie , in 47306

books on written language & literacy,"john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new titles in the field of written language & literacy : writing and identity the discoursal construction of identity in academic writing roz ivanic 1997 xiv , 346 pp . studies in written language and literacy , 5 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 322 x price : us $ 89 . 00 paper : 1 55619 323 8 price : us $ 29 . 95 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 1797 1 price : nlg 178 paper : 90 272 1798 x price : nlg 60 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com writing is not just about conveying ' content ' but also about the representation of self . ( one of the reasons people find writing difficult is that they do not feel comfortable with the ' me ' they are portraying in their writing . academic writing in particular often poses a conflict of identity for students in higher education , because the 's elf ' which is inscribed in academic discourse feels alien to them . ) the main claim of this book is that writing is an act of identity in which people align themselves with socio-culturally shaped subject positions , and thereby play their part in reproducing or challenging dominant practices and discourses , and the values , beliefs and interests which they embody . the first part of the book reviews recent understandings of social identity , of the discoursal construction of identity , of literacy and identity , and of issues of identity in research on academic writing . the main part of the book is based on a collaborative research project about writing and identity with mature-age students , providing : o a case study of one writer 's dilemmas over the presentation of self ; o a discussion of the way in which writers ' life histories shape their presentation of self in writing ; o an interview-based study of issues of ownership , and of accommodation and resistance to conventions for the presentation of self ; linguistic analysis of the ways in which multiple , often contradictory , interests , values , beliefs and practices are inscribed in discourse conventions , which set up a range of possibilities for self-hood for writers . the book ends with implications of the study for research on writing and identity , and for the learning and teaching of academic writing . the book will be of interest to students and researchers in the fields of social identity , literacy , discourse analysis , rhetoric and composition studies , and to all those concerned to understand what is involved in academic writing in order to provide wider access to higher education . writing development . an interdisciplinary view edited by : clotilde pontecorvo , universita di roma , "" la sapienza "" , italy 1997 xxxii , 338 pp . studies in written language & literacy , 6 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 324 6 price : us $ 69 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 1799 8 price : nlg 138 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com this volume presents a selection of papers presented at a series of three workshops organized by the network "" written language and literacy "" as launched by the european science foundation . the main topics making up writing development are : ( 1 ) writing and literacy acquisition : links between speech and writing , with contributions by david r . olson , claire blanche - benveniste , emilia ferreiro , ruth berman , liliana tolchinsky & ana teberosky ; ( 2 ) writing and reading in time and culture , with contributions by collette sirat , francoise desbordes , harmut gunther , peter koch , & jean hebrard : ( 3 ) written language competence in monolingual and bilingual contexts , with contributions by michel fayol & serge mouchon , georges ludi , & ludo verhoeven ; ( 4 ) writing systems , brain structures and languages : a neurolinguistic view , with contributioris by giuseppe cossu , heinz wiimmer & uta frith , & brian butterworth . the volume heads off with an extensive introduction "" studying writing and writing acquisition today : a multidisciplinary view "" . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com

words that are their own opposites ( part 2 ),"in my last summary ( linguist 6 . 74 ) i listed a collection of what i call auto-antonyms - - words that have two opposite meanings . for example , to "" clip "" may mean to cut a little piece off , or to put a little piece on . to "" look over "" may mean careful scrutiny or that you missed an important detail . sometimes the antonymy may be historical : "" nice "" used to denote an unpleasant quality . in that summary , i promised a discussion of whether any generalities could be made about such pairs . are they regularly motivated , or always a coincidence ? i ' m still editing the responses to that question . meanwhile , here are more auto-antonyms that got left out of last post : one auto-antonym that i seem to have overlooked in preparing my post , although i remember looking it over many times before , is "" moot "" , which at once means "" suitable for debate "" and "" not worth discussing "" . impregnable : able to impregnated or inable to be pregnated , as joel hoffman points out . cope ( s ) mate : used to mean antagonist and now means partner or comerade , says ariadna solovyova , who got the word off of anu garg 's a . word . a . day mailing list . it turns out that they were having a week celebrating "" fence-setters "" , evidently another term for what i ' ve been calling auto-antonyms . bruce nevin reminds us of an intercontinental auto-antonym pair : "" public school "" in britain is "" private school "" in the usa and vice versa . infer : historically ( and now , informally ) this means "" imply "" as well . rent , lease : several pointed out to me that these means both lend and borrow . in addition , dan myers wrote to tell me that chinese operates similarly with respect to this pair , and wolfgang lipp notes a similar auto-antonymy to represent "" give "" and "" take "" in pronunciation ( shou4 ) but not in writing . learn / teach : in "" sub "" - standard english , these two meanings fuse into "" learn "" , as they do in standard russian "" uchit ' "" here are some of my personal favorites that i left out of the first summary : sensitive : this may describe either someone with profound understanding for the feelings of others , and tolerates differences of opinion ( thus "" sensitivity training "" for group leaders ) as well as a paranoid who does n't listen to what people are really saying , and decides to take everything as a personal insult . hole / whole : spelled the first way , an entire absence of matter ; the second , entire presence . this reminds me of "" pit "" which can be either a hollow or the stone of a fruit . which reminds me of "" seeded "" oranges ( insert your favorite fuit here ) - - oranges with seeds ( as opposed to navel oranges , which have no seeds ) , or oranges that have had their seeds removed . if you think you ' re beginning to see some patterns here , you ' re not alone ! as i said , i ' ve received a few theories on the ultimate essence of auto-antonymy , historical , psychological , and sociological approaches . these theories show that auto-antonymy comes about for a variety of reasons . in a short while , i ' m going to put up a summary of these theories . then , i ' ll briefly cover related linguistic phenomena , such as words with synonyms that look suspiciously like antonyms : flammable / inflammable , ravel / unravel . oh , and by the way , it turns out i was not the first to come up with the term "" auto-antonym .

chechen,"who are the chechen ? johanna nichols university of california , berkeley author 's note : i have been doing linguistic field work on chechen and its close relative ingush for many years . though i am not an ethnographer or historian , i have tried to bring together here some general information about the chechen people and their language in order to increase public awareness of the people and their situation , and to put a human face on a people of great dignity , refinement , and courage who have paid heavily for their resistance to conquest and assimilation . this paper may be copied freely . if you disseminate it electronically or print it out yourself ( which you are welcome to do ) , reformatting ( font , spacing , etc . ) is ok but please do not edit it . johanna @ uclink . berkeley . edu fax : 510 642-6220 phone ( 510 ) 642-2979 introduction . the chechens and their western neighbors the ingush are distinct ethnic groups with distinct languages , but so closely related and so similar that it is convenient to describe them together . the term "" chechen "" is a russian ethnonym taken from the name of a lowlands chechen village ; "" chechnya "" is derived from that . ( both words are accented on the last syllable in russian . ) this term evidently entered russian from a turkic language , probably kumyk ( spoken in the northern and eastern caucasian plain ) . the chechens call themselves nokhchi ( singular nokhchuo ) . similarly , "" ingush "" is not the self-designation but a russian ethnonym based on a village name ; the ingush call themselves ghalghay . demography . 1989 census figures : 956 , 879 chechen ; 237 , 438 ingush . the chechens are the largest north caucasian group and the second largest caucasian group ( after the georgians ) . location , settlement . the chechen and ingush lands lie just to the east of the principal road crossing the central caucasus ( via the darial pass ) , extending from the foothills and plains into alpine highlands . the lowlands enjoy fertile soil , ample rainfall , a long growing season , and a small oilfield . neighbors to the east are the various peoples of daghestan ( many of them speaking languages related to chechen ) ; in the plains to the north , the turkic - speaking kumyk and ( as of the last three centuries ) russians ; to the west the ingush and to their west the ossetians , who speak a language of the iranian branch of indo - european ; to the south ( across the central caucasus range ) the southern ossetians and the georgians . there are two true cities in chechen and ingush territory : grozny ( pop . about 400 , 000 until 1995 ) , the modern chechen capital founded as a russian fort during the russian conquest of the caucasus ; and vladikavkaz ( pop . about 300 , 000 ; known as ordzhonikidze in soviet times ) in the ingush highlands at the ingush - ossetic territorial boundary , also originally a russian military fort and founded to control the darial pass . nazran in the ingush lowlands was traditionally and is now a large and important market town . the cities had substantial russian and other non - chechen - ingush population ; vladikavkaz was mixed ingush and ossetic with significant numbers of russians and georgians . ( groznyj has now been destroyed and mostly depopulated by russian bombing . vladikavkaz and the adjacent ingush lands were ethnically cleansed of ingush in late 1992 . ) all russian governments - - czars , soviets , post - soviet russia - - have used various means to remove chechen and ingush population from economically important areas and to encourage settlement there by russians and russian cossacks ; hence the mixed population of the cities and lowlands . language . the caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the sheer number and diversity of its languages and for the exotic grammatical structures of the language families indigenous there . this diversity testifies to millennia of generally peaceable relations among autonomous ethnic groups . chechen and ingush , together with batsbi or tsova - tush ( a moribund minority language of georgia ) make up the nakh branch of the nakh - daghestanian , or northeast caucasian , language family . there are over 30 languages in the northeast caucasian family , most of them spoken in daghestan just to the east of chechnya . the split of the nakh branch from the rest of the family took place about 5000-6000 years ago ( thus the nakh - daghestanian family is comparable in age to indo - european , the language family ancestral to english , french , russian , greek , hindi , etc . ) , though the split of chechen from ingush probably dates back only to the middle ages . the entire family is indigenous to the caucasus mountains and has no demonstrable relations to any language group either in or out of the caucasus . like most indigenous caucasian languages chechen has a wealth of consonants , including uvular and pharyngeal sounds like those of arabic and glottalized or ejective consonants like those of many native american languages ; and a large vowel system somewhat resembling that of swedish or german . like its sister languages chechen has extensive inflectional morphology including a dozen nominal cases and several gender classes , and forms long and complex sentences by chaining participial clauses together . the case system is ergative , i . e . the subject of a transitive verb appears in an oblique case and the direct object is in the nominative , as is the subject of an intransitive verb ( as in basque ) ; verbs take no person agreement , but some of them agree in gender with the direct object or intransitive subject . 97 % or more of the chechens claim chechen as their first language , though most also speak russian , generally quite fluently . chechen and ingush are so close to each other that with some practice a speaker of one has fair comprehension of the other , and where the two languages are in contact they are used together : a chechen addresses an ingush in chechen , the ingush replies in ingush , and communication proceeds more or less smoothly . chechen was not traditionally a written language . an orthography using the russian alphabet was created in the 1930 's and is used for various kinds of publication , although for most chechens the chief vehicle of literacy is russian . traditionally , as in most north caucasian societies , many individuals were bilingual or multilingual , using an important lowlands language ( e . g . kumyk , spoken in market towns and prestigious as its speakers were early converts to islam ) for inter-ethnic communication ; any literacy was in arabic . russian has now displaced both kumyk and arabic in these functions . particularly if the chechen and ingush economies continue to be destroyed and unemployment and mass homelessness continue to undermine the social structure , there is danger that chechen and ingush will be functionally reduced to household languages and will then yield completely to russian , with concomitant loss of much of the cultural heritage . history . the chechens have evidently been in or near their present territory for some 6000 years and perhaps much longer ; there is fairly seamless archeological continuity for the last 8000 years or more in central daghestan , suggesting that the nakh - daghestanian language family is long indigenous . the caucasian highlands were apparently relatively populous and prosperous in ancient times . from the late middle ages until the 19th century , a worldwide cooling phase known as the little ice age caused glacial advances and shortened growing seasons in the alpine highlands , weakening the highland economies and triggering migrations to the lowlands and abandonment of some alpine villages . this period of economic hardship coincided with the russian conquest of the caucasus which lasted from the late 1500 's to the mid - 1800 's . in all of recorded history and inferable prehistory the chechens ( and for that matter the ingush ) have never undertaken battle except in defense . the russian conquest of the caucasus was difficult and bloody , and the chechens and ingush with their extensive lowlands territory and access to the central pass were prime targets and were among the most tenacious defenders . russia destroyed lowlands villages and deported , exiled , or slaughtered civilian population , forcing capitulation of the highlands . numerous refugees migrated or were deported to various muslim countries of the middle east , and to this day there are chechen populations in jordan and turkey . since then there have been various chechen rebellions against russian and soviet power , as well as resistance to collectivization , anti-religious campaigns , and russification . in 1944 the chechens and ingush , together with the karachay - balkar , crimean tatars , and other nationalities were deported en masse to kazakhstan and siberia , losing at least one-quarter and perhaps half of their population in transit . though "" rehabilitated "" in 1956 and allowed to return in 1957 , they lost land , economic resources , and civil rights ; since then , under both soviet and post - soviet governments , they have been the objects of ( official and unofficial ) discrimination and discriminatory public discourse . in recent years , russian media have depicted the chechen nation and / or nationality as thugs and bandits responsible for organized crime and street violence in russia . in late 1992 russian tanks and troops , sent to the north caucasus ostensibly as peacekeepers in an ethnic dispute between ingush and ossetians over traditional ingush lands politically incorporated into north ossetia after the 1944 deportation , forcibly removed the ingush population from north ossetia and destroyed the ingush villages there ; there were many deaths and there are now said to be up to 60 , 000 refugees in ingushetia ( about one-quarter of the total ingush population ) . in developments reminiscent of today 's invasion of chechnya , in the weeks leading up to the action the ingush were depicted ( inaccurately ) in regional media as heavily armed and poised for a large-scale and organized attack on ossetians , and the russian military once deployed appears to have undertaken ethnic cleansing at least partly on its own initiative . ( my only sources of information for this paragraph are russian and western news reports . helsinki watch is preparing a report for publication in early 1995 . ) the invasion of chechnya presently underway has meant great human suffering for all residents of the chechen lowlands , including russians , but only the chechens are at risk of ethnic cleansing , wholesale economic ruin , and loss of linguistic and cultural heritage . religion . the chechens and ingush are sunni muslims of the hanafi school , having converted in the late 17th to early 19th centuries . islam is now , as it has been since the conversion , moderate but strongly held and a central component of the culture and the ethnic identity . economy , customs . traditionally , the lowlands chechen were grain farmers and the highlanders raised sheep . at the time of russian contact the lowlands were wealthy and produced a grain surplus , while the highlands were not self-sufficient in food and traded wool and eggs for lowlands grain . chechen social structure and ethnic identity rest on principles of family and clan honor , respect for and deference to one 's elders , hospitality , formal and dignified relations between families and clans , and courteous and formal public and private behavior . kinship and clan structure are patriarchal , but women have full social and professional equality and prospects for financial independence equivalent to those of men . academics , writers , artists , and intellectuals in general are well versed in the cultures of both the european and the islamic worlds , and the society as a whole can be said to regard both of these heritages as their own together with the indigenous north caucasian artistic and intellectual tradition . social organization . until the russian conquest the chechens were an independent nation with their own language and territory but no formal political organization . villages were autonomous , as were clans . villages had mutual defense obligations in times of war , and clans had mutual support relations that linked them into larger clan confederations ( which generally coincided with dialects ) . each clan was headed by a respected elder . there were no social classes and no differences of rank apart from those of age , kinship , and earned social honor . select bibliography anonymous . 1992 . ethnic cleansing comes to russia . the economist , november 28 , 1992 , p . 60 . blanch , lesley . 1960 . the sabres of paradise . new york : viking . comrie , bernard . 1981 . the languages of the soviet union . cambridge : cambridge university press . conquest , robert . 1970 . the nation killers : the soviet deportation of nationalities . london : macmillan . critchlow , james . 1991 .

comparative method,"alexis manaster ramer asks about the claim that relatedness and / or subgrouping should be established only based on systematic morphological relationships of the sort likely to be observed in paradigms or declensions . i ' m familiar with this claim only in a much weaker form , that morphological comparisons are more reliable than phonological ones as a basis for establishing linguistic relationships and subgroups . on this basis , for example , robert hetzron in 1976 * proposed a rigorous internal subgrouping for the semitic languages based on affixes in the verb paradigms . hetzron 's proposal that hebrew , arabic , and aramaic constitute a central semitic group is , i believe , correct ; and it is supported by much more evidence than hetzron adduces , much of it morphological and morpho-syntactic ( e . g . , innovation of novel negative markers , etc . ) . i may be reading too much into these claims of morphological priority in establishing subgrouping , but i have always interpreted them as a reaction to the difficulty of distinguishing convergent from shared phonological development on a principled basis . that is , because it can be difficult to determine whether a particular recurrent sound change in a language group represents shared innovation rather than convergent development , it might be pragmatically safer to rely on morphological innovation . thus , in the case of the semitic languages , such changes as * p to / f / or * g to / jh / ( as in junk ) would , if treated as shared innovation , lead to subgroups that are inconsistent with those deduced by other means . on the other hand , "" unusual "" changes like the change of proto - semitic glottalic consonants to pharyngealized consonants are much more likely to represent shared innovation , given the typological rarity of pharyngealized consonants . with regard to fritz newmeyer 's questions about comparative syntactic reconstruction , i do n't know of any systematic published counters to jeffers ' ( and others ' ) claims that it is * in principle * impossible . however , i think that a good case can be made that this is an overly pessimistic assessment . the problem , of course , is the appropriate context : we compare phonemes in words and / or morphemes and morphemes in paradigms , but it 's not clear what the context might be for word orders . presumably discourse context plays a role . i would imagine that if all the languages in a family shared an unusual word order ( vis a vis their dominant types , whatever those might be ) in counterfactuals , we might want to attribute that order to their latest shared ancestor . pragmatically speaking , it 's a lot easier to find information about the morphological context of particular phonemes than it is to find reliable information about the larger context for sentence and construction types . nonetheless , at least inchoately ( and perhaps it is the inchoateness that jeffers objects to ) , * some * notion of syntactic reconstruction is surely behind claims that proto - indo - european was sov or proto - semitic was svo , and the like . * "" two principles of genetic reconstruction "" , lingua 38 : 89-104 . alice faber faber @ haskins . yale . edu

english snow words,"jonathan david bobaljik posted a message to vol . 5-1276 of this list in which he discusses the various yup ' ik words for snow that have been contributed by anthony woodbury . for the sake of comparison he has a list of 9 or 10 english words for snow and snow-like things . i thought it would be useful to find out whether each of these english words means _ primarily _ snow or whether the snow sense is derived , figurative , or otherwise secondary . i have consulted the various editions of the oxford english dictionary . my results are as follows : a . acceptable cases : 1 . snow : a good english word with a respectable pedigree . means primarily snow . 2 . sleet : also good . by the way , is there an eskimo term corresponding to this ? 3 . slush : also good . 4 . avalanche : this word seems to have referred to snow avalanches from the beginning . 5 . blizzard : the first edition of the oed says , "" a modern word . . . . as applied to a 's now-squall , ' the word became general in the american newspapers during the severe winter of 1880-81 ; but according to the _ milwaukee republican _ = ff 4 march 1881 , it had been so applied in the _ northern vindicator _ ( esthersville , iowa ) between 1860 and 1870 . it was apparently in colloquial use in the west much earlier . . . "" the latest edition of the oed has a citation from 1859 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * b . doubtful cases : 1 . cornice : this is really an architectural term , meaning the "" crown "" on a building . its use to refer to a type of snow formation is merely figurative . 2 . firn : this is certainly a very rare and specialized word . the oed marks it "" not naturalized "" ; its synonym _ n ' ev ' e _ is marked the same way . i would accept neither . 3 . drift : with the meaning 's now-drift ' this word is attested c . 1300 , ( "" this castel . . quitter es pan snau drif [ t ] .

special issue machine translation : final call for papers,"final call for papers the machine translation journal special issue on anaphora resolution in machine translation guest editor : ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) the interpretation of anaphora is crucial for the successful operation of a machine translation system . in particular , it is essential to resolve the anaphoric relation when translating into languages which mark the gender of pronouns . unfortunately , the majority of mt systems developed in the seventies and eighties did not adequately address the problems of identifying the antecedents of anaphors in the source language and producing the anaphoric "" equivalents "" in the target language . as a consequence , only a limited number of mt systems have been successful in translating discourse , rather than isolated sentences . one reason for this situation is that in addition to anaphora resolution being itself a very complicated task , translation adds a further dimension to the problem in that the reference to a discourse entity encoded by a source language anaphor by the speaker ( or writer ) has not only to be identified by the hearer ( translator or translation system ) but also re-encoded in a coreferential expression in a different language . the nineties have seen an intensification of research efforts in anaphora resolution in machine translation . this can be seen in the growing number of related projects which have reported promising new results ( e . g . wada 1990 ; leass & schwall 1991 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1992 ; chen 1992 ; saggion & carvalho 1994 ; preuss et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1995 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1997 ; geldbach 1997 ) . however , we still feel that additional work is needed to highlight and further explore the specifics of the problem in operational mt environments , including fully automatic machine translation and machine - aided translation . we are inviting high-quality , original research papers describing recent advances in anaphora resolution in machine translation . topics to be addressed include ( but are not limited to ) - operational anaphora resolution components in machine translation - resolution of zero pronouns in mt environments - lexical transfer of anaphors across languages - to what extent have the latest trends towards knowledge-poor , corpus - driven and robust approaches in anaphora resolution , been called upon in machine translation ? - what are the most scalable contributory factors / resolution strategies in mt ? - what makes anaphora resolution a more complex task in machine translation ? - multilingual anaphora resolution submission and format articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header "" submission to coat anaphora special issue "" , or in hard-copy to machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 3300 az dordrecht the netherlands or machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 230 accord , ma 02018-023 u . s . a . the submission deadline is 15 may 1998 . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . for more details , please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are also requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk or in hard-copy to ruslan mitkov , school of languages and european studies , university of wolverhampton , stafford st . , wolverhampton wv1 1sb , united kingdom . guest editor : ruslan mitkov school of languages and european studies university of wolverhampton stafford st . wolverhampton wv1 1sb telephone ( 44-1902 ) 322471 fax ( 44-1902 ) 322739 email r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk guest editorial board : breck baldwin ( university of pennsylvania , philadelphia ) david carter ( sri international , cambridge ) guenter goerz ( university of nuernberg / erlangen ) lynette hirschman ( mitre , mclean ) richard kittredge ( university of montreal ) susan luperfoy ( mitre , mclean ) tony mcenery ( lancaster university ) ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) frederique segond ( ranx xerox , grenoble ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) keh - yih su ( national tsing hua university , taiwan ) yorick wilks ( university of sheffield )

aum shinri kyo,"content - length : 1513 what is aum ? the japanese police are currently investigating a religious sect called "" aum shinri kyo "" in relation to last week 's gas attack on the tokyo subway . aum shinri kyo has been translated as "" sublime truth "" in the press . with my limited knowledge of japanese , i know that shinri can be glossed as ' truth ' and kyo is a sino - japanese morpheme found at the end of the names of many if not most religions . aum , however , is a bit of a puzzler . japanese phonology only allows syllable-final [ m ] as an allophone of / n / before labial consonants , which is not the case here . does anyone know what this aum means , where it comes from , and if it is pronounced with a final [ m ] by speakers of japanese ? david p . baxter urbana , illinois dbaxter @ uxa . cso . uiuc . edu

re : 6 . 199 ipa,"why must this kind of stuff be decided by a vote ? since obviously ipa membership does not equal interest in the matter and never will , all that will be achieved if some of us join the ipa just to force this issue , is that it will be "" packed "" in some other way than the way it is now , but it will never be representative . why not let the invisible hand of the "" market "" of ideas operate freely instead ? as fewer and fewer people use ipa 's made-up symbols , either that organization will become completely irrelevant , or it will make up its own mind to respond to the "" market forces "" , or perhaps some other group will step in and by proposing a system that is manifestly better than anyone else 's , achieve standardization that way . i really think that if a few of the top names in phonetics got together with the editors of a few journals , they could probably come up with something . it could also simply come from anywhere else : if someone were to publish a truly superior system and people started using it . finally , in reality , it seems that certain trends are occurring anyway and that in particular the resistance to the hachek and the use of the corresponding ipa symbols are on the wane . if we can put up with the inconsistencies of american vs . canadian vs . british spelling , we can probably do just as well here . and if we are gonna worry about something , i would worry more about those cases where te same symbols have different commonly used meanings like ' j ' and ' y ' . alexis mr

re : your requested info,"thank you for your interest in our training course . success courses offers an extensive video tape training course in "" how to collect judicial judgments "" . if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a judicial judgment is and why processing judicial judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a judicial judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : "" its now up to you to collect on the judgment "" . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . "" in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . "" the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected judicial judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 4 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed in this profession . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing judicial judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of judicial judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today success courses and our associates have over 632 million dollars in judicial judgments that we are currently processing . of this 632 million , 36 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid judicial judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non-confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor does n't know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful judicial processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with judicial judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you do n't call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote 's from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future . there 's no stopping me now . as of february 3rd , 1995 , thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on . after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now .

"re : 6 . 1070 , disc : sex / lang , re : 1023","in the ongoing discussion of the "" epicene he "" , i think that perhaps we are making some headway on certain issues , but all kinds of new loose ends keep unraveling . what seems clearly established is that the 18th century grammarians of english did not invent this usage , since ( a ) it had existed in english for centuries , and ( b ) it seems to be a linguistic universal or something close to it , not a peculiarity of english however , i do not see why anyone should call me "" misandrist "" ( or "" mysandrist "" ) . if it is because my name could easily be taken to be a woman 's name ( although i happen to be a man ) , that would really be too bad . if it is because of my acceptance of the common view that almost all or perhaps all societies are in some important sense male-dominated , then that too would be inaccurate . i also believe that for several centuries of us and brazilian and so on history white people held black slaves and not vice versa , but that does not mean i hate white people . the whole issue of the sense in which it is true that men have dominated human societies is certainly in some respects a subtle one , and one could certainly argue that this dominance has done us little if any good , but i do not see how one can deny that it is a fact . however , for the purposes at hand , this is not germane . what is relevant is ( a ) the linguistic fact that languages that make any kind of gender or sex distinction in pronouns or verb forms or anything else , as a rule use the male or masculine forms as unmarked forms for persons of either or unknown gender in some constructions ( which may differ from language to language in detail ) , and ( b ) the anthropological fact that all or nearly all human societies make social distinctions based on sex which go beyond reproduction , breast-feeding , and the like , and ( c ) the further anthropological fact that the male roles / activities are routinely perceived as somehow superior , dominant , better , normative , whatever ( regardless of whether they really are , which is a completely different issue ) . so what it all boils down to , again , is that i maintain that it makes no sense whatever to discuss the origin of the epicene he phenomenon in the context of the story of english prescriptive grammar , but only in the context of the way in which perceptions of sex roles have informed the structure of language ( as of any other institution ) . alexis manaster ramer

and ' possess ' with aru . basque : * edun ( nowadays - du - ) is used for possession and as an auxiliary . in addition , in the south , the verb eduki ' hold ' has also to some extent been grammaticalized to denote ' possess ' and also ' perfect ' with transitive verbs , while intransitives form the perfect with izan ' be ' . this development seems to be following the lines of the development latin ) romance . hebrew : there is no verb ' possess ' in hebrew : possession is expressed periphrastically ( with the "" dative "" ) . interestingly , here also there is a connection between ' possess ' and ' compulsion ' and ' existence ' , which all apparently use this construction . aramaic : in many aramaic dialects , the earlier construction ' past participle + dative ( ' l ' ) + pronoun ' became the past tense . l is now predominantly used for a goal with verbs of motion , but is also used for possession . arabic : in cairene colloquial arabic , @ anda ' at / near / by ' is used for possession and is then negated like a verb , not like a preposition . tamil iru ' be ( located ) ' + dative is used for possession and for durative / continuous aspect , but not for perfect / perfective . kol ' hold ' , although not used for ' possess ' can be combined with iru and denotes that the action is one of the following : self-benefactive , reflexive , deliberate and / or accidental ( depending on what was expected ) . crow : ' exist ' / ' not-exist ' is not only used for existence but also ' possess ' and perfective aspect . finish : pitaa ' hold ' can also be used to express ' compulsion ' but interestingly , not ' possess ' . dakota : yuha ' hold ' may also be used to some extent for ' have ' , otherwise ' be with ' is used . chinese : yong3yiu3 , where yong3 denotes ' embrace ' , can also be used to express ' possess , own ' . to stress that one has total control , one may use zhung3yiu3 , where zhung3 denotes ' hold in one 's palm ' ( yiu3 is ' possess ' , ' existence ' and can also be used for ' perfect ' with questions and negative statements ) idg * ghebh ' give ' -

contrastive linguistics and translation,"- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - call for papers and participation symposium contrastive linguistics and translation studies empirical approaches universit catholique de louvain louvain - la - neuve , belgium 5 - 6 february , 1999 introduction over the last few years an important change has taken place in research into contrastive linguistics and translation studies . whereas previously both fields have drawn on largely introspective methodologies , most research is now conducted on large bodies of bilingual or multilingual data , a change which has had the important effect of providing the two disciplines with a much more solid empirical basis . many researchers are now working with computerised data , in many cases using specifically designed linguistic software tools to conduct automatic or semi-automatic analyses . bilingual concordancers are a case in point . research projects along these lines are becoming more widespread throughout the academic community and initial results are highly encouraging , revealing the enormous potential of computerised corpus analyses both for contrastive linguistics and translation studies . of course many researchers are still opting to use purely manual methods of analysis : indeed for many types of linguistic analysis ( semantic or discourse analysis for example ) , they will remain the only option for the foreseeable future . it is also notable that there are very few bilingual computer corpora available . for many therefore , the use of manual methods may not be a question of choice . this symposium is intended to bring together specialists in the fields of contrastive linguistics and translation studies conducting research on bilingual or multilingual corpora of any type . one important objective will be to demonstrate to what extent detailed corpus analysis can support , contradict or refine introspective contrastive analyses . another key aim is to examine the strengths and weaknesses of manual and automatic methods of data analysis . and lastly , the meeting will provide a valuable opportunity to exchange and share data , a step on the way to setting up an international multilingual databank available to everyone working in the field . symposium topics below is a non-exhaustive list of subject areas which we hope to address during the symposium : - contrastive lexicology ( in particular , contrastive phraseology ) - bilingual / multilingual lexicography - contrastive semantics - contrastive syntax - contrastive pragmatics - compiling and exploiting bilingual / multilingual computerised corpora - software tools for the analysis of bilingual corpora ( bilingual concordancing , automatic alignment , multilingual part-of - speech tagging , etc . ) - bilingual corpora and automatic / computer-aided translation languages english and french will be the two official symposium languages , with most papers given in english . symposium venue the symposium will take place in louvain - la - neuve , an entirely pedestrian university campus which , with its cafes , restaurants , shops , sports centre , cinema and theatre , offers all the advantages of a real town . 20 minutes away from brussels , it is easy to reach by car , train and plane , brussels national airport being within very easy reach . deadline for abstracts anyone wishing to present a paper at the symposium should send a one page abstract in electronic format ( preferably a word attachment ) to sylviane granger ( address below ) by 16 october 1998 at the latest . notification of acceptance will be given by 6 november 1998 . payment the cost of the symposium is as follows : - before 30 november 1998 : 2500 belgian francs - after 30 november 1998 : 3500 belgian francs this includes the symposium fee , the book of abstracts , coffee breaks and lunch on both days . accommodation two types of accommodation are on offer : - chambre la rsidence universitaire ( le relais , rue de la gare 6 , 1348 louvain - la - neuve ) : 1600 fb par nuit , petit djeuner inclus ;

on language and separatism,"on linguist vol-6 - 955 , jelly julia ( julia @ let . rug . nl ) says : "" basque and catalan separatism is not based on language . why do we never hear "" anything about galician separatism on the iberian peninsula ? galician is a "" language very different from spanish ( and not so different from portuguese ) . "" the name of the region is galicia and is part of spain . galician is a language "" much older than spanish itself : it was used for poetry and by the kings in "" ancient times . still , we do not hear a lot about galician separatism . neither "" do we hear anything about leonese separatism , aragonese separatism , andalusian "" separatism , simply because it does not exist . separatism on the peninsula has "" nothing to do with language . it has everything to do with historic rights of "" old kingdoms . galician separatism exists . it just simply does n't reach the news because galician separatists ( a minority ) have n't killed people , even though they ' ve tried to on a couple of occasions . on the contrary , galician separatists ( and federalists ) have been killed by the spanish army and police ( during franco 's uprising and regime ) . there are galician separatists in the jails of the spanish kingdom . the spiral of stret and institutional violence is benefitial to the western democratic states . separatism in the iberian peninsula , as elsewhere , has to do with the way peoples view ( or are led to view ) their own identity in opposition to other identities . language is most often , if not always , an issue . as for galiza , to the extent that the spanish state is able to keep the lid on the language issue by taming the language of galiza ( portuguese ) and turning it into a domestic "" galician "" , no problem - - galiza won't reach the news . galiza , as many other minorized cultures of the world , is caught between two states : spain and portugal . what the kingdom of spain and , particularly , its representatives in galiza ( the majority of the local political and intellectual elites ) can't cope with is the fact that another state 's language , portuguese , is spoken ( and written as such , by a small fraction of the elites ) within spanish territory . legislative , administrative , and judicial measures have been taken to silence some intellectuals , writers , and teachers who support , with rational arguments , the view that "" galician "" is just a set of regional and social varieties of portuguese , and therefore it should be written with the portuguese orthography . these acts of actual repression , discrimination and censorship by the mechanisms of the spanish state do n't reach the news either . the situation of the "" language question "" in galiza nowadays is the furthest one could imagine from a civilized , technical and political debate on how to articulate and reconcile galician identity / ies with galiza 's language . it is discouraging and worrisome to see how the term "" reintegrationist "" , which refers to those who seek the effective recognition of galician as a part of its natural linguistic domain , portuguese , is being thrown around as an insult in public and academic discourse . i should clarify that the separatist / reintegrationist lines intersect each other . that is , there are galician separatists or nationalists who are reintegrationists and use the portuguese orthography , and then there are other separatists and nationalists who are very happy with the institutionally-supported view of galician as a "" separate language "" to be written , however , with a spanish - based orthography . in the meantime , galician portuguese is being learned less and less as a first language . but that 's not the real issue . celso alvarez - caccamo lxalvarz @ udc . es

( i get a lot of requests for both of these types of fonts , and i see requests for information on the list , too . ) i am interested in ftp sites for obtaining public domain / shareware fonts , along with addresses , etc . of people or organizations that create fonts for sale ( the copyrighted fonts - - the ones you can ' t copy freely ) . i will compile a list of where to get the ftp fonts , and a separate section with a listing of who provides which copyrighted fonts , and how to obtain them . i will also download the fonts from ftp sites , and pass them on to whoever asks for them . one of the problems i encounter when i try to read the work of others , is the usage of different orthographies by different people . i would like to see a common ( within each language ) orthography for each of the languages we all study - - the smaller language groups quite often do n't have a common orthography . ( i do n't know if such a thing is even possible ; there may be too much disagreement on what a font for language _ _ _ _ _ should look like . we seem to disagree on just about every other topic , but that 's healthy , i think . ) if i could develop a repository for fonts , then , for example , i could write a paper about the cahuilla language and e-mail the paper anywhere in the world along with the font ( s ) necessary to read / print the paper . ( copyrighted fonts would have to be purchased from the source . ) others could do the same with "" their "" languages . often , when writing papers , and quoting the works of others , i need to write using a non-standard font , so i need to make it myself , then go back to my writing . i have n't counted them , but i have a bunch of partial fonts for many languages , both orthography and ipa . however , these partially completed fonts are based on books written as far back as the 1800s . i seriously doubt that they represent current writing systems . i do n't want to step on anybody 's toes , but i can develop a font for any language out there . i can do both truetype and postscript fonts for both the pc and macs . however , if somebody else has already done the work , it makes sense to use their fonts . why re-invent the wheel ? as far as naming the fonts i ' ve created , i ' ve been using the three-letter language codes from _ ethnologue : languages of the world _ , ed . barbara f . grimes , 12th ed . , 1992 . for example , my cahuilla orthography is c-chl . ttf ( truetype for pc ) , and my cahuilla ipa is c-chl - p . ttf . i recently responded to jan tent 's posting about yesterday , today , and tomorrow words . i sent her words in north american indian languages . she wrote back asking about some of the symbols i had used . if a common font set was available , i could have e-mailed her a font for her computer , and she could have read my reply with the native orthography and ipa pronunciations in the document i sent . to me , it seems that this would be useful to people . i 'd like to hear others ' opinions about such a project ( in addition to where to ftp or buy fonts ) . i would especially like to hear from the indigenous language speakers on this list , in addition to the linguists . so send me your information and opinions , even if the opinion is , "" chuck , you ' re an idiot . scrap the whole idea . "" i ' ll post a summary to the list if there 's enough interest , otherwise i ' ll respond personally . if you need a font for a language you ' re working on , let me know that , too . happy holidays , chuck coker work : ( 909 ) 882-2099 ( united states ) home : ( 909 ) 886-5035 ( united states ) e-mail : cjcoker @ csupomona . edu = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = there have been no dragons in my life , only small spiders and stepping in gum . i could have coped with the dragons . - - anonymous ( but wise )

re : 5 . 1370 can the comparative method be applied to syntax ?,"theoretically , there is no reason why the comparative method could not be applied to syntactic properties . however , there are two practical , very great , impediments : 1 . syntax dealing with word order , what is word order ? and further which word order in which environments ? e . g . : ich verstehe sie . ploetzlich verstehe ich sie . ( subordinating conjunction ) ich sie verstehe . un grand homme . un homme grand . ma chemise propre . ma propre chemise . 2 . how do we measure the difference ? how far is svo from sov ? from vso ? not only we do not know how to describe syntactic properties satisfactorily , but we do not know how to measure their differences , or , it boils down to the same , their similarities . now , you can validly argue that a binary scale ( same , different , and no shades of grey in between ) is good enough . remains that you do not reach valid comparisons on the basis of a single feature , but of many . if languages x and y have n identical features out of n , we are tempted to say that their syntactic similarity is n / n . but that is true if and only if each feature has the same weighting . on top of that , we do not even know what constitutes * one * feature . for instance , we may consider svo as consisting of two to three features : 1 . relative order of subject and verb 2 . relative order of verb and object 3 . relative order of subject and object where necessary to disambiguate . and further , how do we specify free sv order for instance ? via a ternary relation ( precede , follow , free ) , thus order = ( free , s , v ) or a binary relation ( precede , follow ) and a union , thus order = ( precede , s , v ) + ( follow , s , v ) ? too many questions unanswered , i fear even unaddressed . too many questions issuing from them . we cannot , i think , found a proper methodology on such shaky grounds . we 'd better be content with arguing futilely until we are blue in the keyboard . or else set about tackling those questions , a daunting task . j . guy @ trl . oz . au

5 per additional person in room . they are not as nice as the canyon inn rooms , and staying away from the workshop diminishes the coziness of the workshop experience , so we will not use them unless we run out of space at the canyon inn ( and this does not appear to be a problem at the moment ) . if you have to stay there , we will provide transportation to and from the conference site . if you want to stay in bloomington for a few days before or after the workshop , we have blocked some rooms in eigenmann hall , a graduate dormitory with single rooms , on-premises cafeteria , and within walking distance of our library . rooms cost about $ 28 / day ( food is not included ) , and may be paid for by credit card , cash , or checks . you should request these rooms through me in advance of the workshop , specifying arrival and departure dates . food the conference will provide the following meals at no charge to participants ( if you are accompanied by a spouse or children , they are welcome to join us but you must pay for their food ; email me for details ) . it is very important that i have an exact count before the conference , as i must provide this information to the canyon inn , so please keep me informed of your plans friday evening : outdoor picnic dinner ( barbecue chicken and ribs , various other dishes ; vegetarians can feast on salads etc . ; indoors if it rains ) saturday morning : coffee / juice / pastries / fruit at the conference room saturday lunch : buffet with sandwiches , salads , beverages , etc . sunday morning : same as saturday morning . saturday evening and sunday lunch are not provided for . i figure many people might want to go to a restaurant in bloomington , but there is a decent restaurant in the canyon inn as well , and one pleasant-looking hilltop restaurant in spenser as well . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * george fowler [ email ] gfowler @ indiana . edu dept . of slavic languages [ dept . tel . ] 1-812 -

"re : 5 . 1305 qs : canadian american , ipa - fonts for dos , genre analysis ,","it may be of general interest to note some differences between canadian and american accents , bearing in mind that both types of accents vary quite a bit , and that what is characteristic of some parts of canada may be characteristic of some parts of the us . for example , one of the most widespread characteristics of canadian english is the merger of short o and long open o , e . g . , hock vs . hawk . although this is also characteristic of certain areas of the us , they are generally not contiguous with the canadian areas of the merger . thus , most of the us border area with canada maintains a distinction . this , then , is a striking contrast , geographically , between canada and the adjacent us at most points . the stereotypical canadian feature , for canadians themselves , and for others who know ( including those who must have handed the canadians their self-stereotype ) is the pronunciation of / aw / as in "" out "" , "" house "" , etc . the nucleus is mid rather than low , so that it sounds something like long o as in "" oat "" as spoken by standard british or philadelphian speakers . commonalities between canada and the adjacent us , similar to the last mentioned feature , is the raising of the nucleus of / ay / as in "" right "" . this seems to keep getting discussed in the context of causing a vowel contrast between "" writer "" and "" rider "" . the canadian and upstate ny contrast has to do with height along the center of vowel space , rather than along the periphery ( central vs . back nucleus ) as in new york city . upstate ny at least , though , seems to be distinct in canada by the more extreme raising of the nucleus of / ay / , and it often sound fronted , as if like a more widespread american / ey / sound , as in "" eight "" . canada is more extreme than the adjacent us in its raising ( from low to mid ) of the / aw / nucleus - the stereotype i discussed above . i have not seen discussion elsewhere of how canadian english deals with short o before r in open syllables . more than most american dialects , it lengthens and raises them to merge with long o , so that "" sorry "" rhymes with "" story "" . this is rare for the words "" sorry "" , "" sorrow "" , "" borrow "" and a few others across us dialects , although it is general in r-ful areas for "" forest "" , "" orange "" and most such words . in this case , the adjacent us dialects , e . g . , northern wisconsin , agree with canada , so that there is a continuum , not the striking border distinction observed for the hock : hawk merger . that 's enough , although i welcome observations on other and more localised canadian and border us dialects . as for the british , when they have an american actor and do n't want to make anything out of the fact that he 's american in a film , they call him canadian - - in order to explain the accent . apparently they do n't hear the difference - - i guess they only hear flapped t 's , but think americans have to be stereotyped as characters , while canadians have more latitude .

the comparative method and syntactic reconstruction,"the ongoing discussion in the list about the comparative method has raised questions about its applicability to syntactic reconstruction . i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : "" most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . "" or "" of all the languages in family y , only language ( a ) has some particular syntactic property . therefore we can assume that this property of ( a ) is an innovation not present in proto - y . "" in other words , there is the tacit assumption that the comparative method can be applied to syntax . but can it ? could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? most of the modern germanic languages are svo . should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? standard introductions to historical linguistics ( e . g . anttila , jeffers & lehiste , etc . ) argue that the comparative method is inapplicable to syntactic reconstruction due to the fact that there is no analog in syntax to regular sound change . oversimplifying a bit , words are composed of phonemes ; the comparative method assumes that phonemic change in one word in a particular environment will be mirrored by like changes in other words in similar environments . but what are the syntactic analogues of words and phonemes ? and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . i would be interested in hearing the opinions of others on the question of syntactic reconstruction on the basis of comparing similarities and differences ; also , i wonder if there has been discussion in the literature that has led to a change in opinion from what i took to be the standard position that the comparative method is inapplicable . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu

journees de rochebrune 99,"2nd and last call for papers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - journes de rochebrune 1999 : rencontres interdisciplinaires sur les systemes complexes naturels et artificiels du 31 janvier 1999 au 6 fevrier 1999 . appel a communications theme des journes 1999 toutes indications disponibles : http : / / www . idiap . ch / ~ glotin / rb99 . html conflits des interpretations et interpretation des conflits le robert definit l ' interpretation comme l ' activite de donner une signification que ce soit aux signes en general ou aux phnomenes . la connaissance que nous avons de cette activite est relativement peu structure au contraire de l ' activite de modelisation qui est specifique quoique dominante dans la science occidentale contemporaine . l ' interpretation peut se comprendre a la fois comme un processus et comme son resultat . elle peut donc etre difficilement separe de sa dynamique d ' elaboration . c ' est pourquoi nous voulons explorer plus precisement le role des conflits et antagonismes dont heraclite disait qu ' ils sont les seuls moteurs d ' evolution . le conflit ne doit pas forcement etre compris dans le sens de la logique classique dans laquelle il est source d ' incoherence ; ni dans le sens etymologique de forces qui se heurtent ce qui rendrait le conflit source de destruction , mais au contraire comme dynamique creatrice une fois placee dans un mecanisme d ' equilibration , possiblement par interpretation du conflit lui-meme . nous souhaitons poser les questions ( non-exhaustives ) suivantes : * le vivant interprete-t - il son environnement et quel sens donner a cette assertion ? entre adn et organisation cellulaire , qu ' en est-il de l ' embryogenese comme hermeneutique du vivant ? * quelle diffrence y a-t - il entre l ' interpretation par le vivant , l ' homme et la machine ? quels modeles en avons-nous et sont-ils conflictuels ? que nous apprend l ' ordinateur comme machine universelle a traiter le signe ? * quel est le role des conflits et antagonismes dans la construction d ' interpretation ? pourquoi les eviter et comment les utiliser ? * comment une interpretation individuelle est-elle possible ou qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation collective et du role de la multiplicite des points de vue , qu ' ils soient methodologiques , contextuels ou de niveaux , et donc des conflits qui peuvent en resulter ? qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation comme resolution des conflits et donc moteur d ' evolution ? * si , comme dans la deuxieme definition du greimas ( voir notes ) , les signes sont toujours deja signifiants , comment peuvent-ils avoir ce statut ? qu ' est-ce qui les rend signifiants ? qu ' en est-il de la pensee symbolique des civilisations anciennes ou orientales et qui a ete cultivee chez nous jusqu ' au moyen - age ( g . durand ) ? comment cette forme d ' interpretation s ' articule-t - elle avec les signes decontextualises , jusqu ' a etre calculables et a la conception de l ' interpretation qui en decoule ? * de quels processus de legitimation des interpretations disposons-nous ? quelles relations l ' interpretation entretient-elle avec l ' action ou l ' argumentation que ce soit avant , par ou apres coup ? comment l ' interpretation s ' articule-t - elle a la controverse , la negociation , l ' ajustement ? * puisque la simulation joue un role de plus en plus grand dans l ' activite du modelisateur : comment s ' articulent la simulation et l ' interpretation ? ces questions sont au coeur de la plupart des sciences et plus particulirement la semiotique , l ' hermeneutique , les sciences cognitives et neurosciences , la philosophie , la psychologie , la linguistique et psycholinguistique , l ' intelligence artificielle , l ' anthropologie et la sociologie . elles sous-tendent galement l ' activit scientifique , tant dans la modelisation que dans l ' exprimentation . elles sont inseparables des activites des concepteurs - ingenieurs , informaticiens , architectes . . . - dont les productions proviennent de la resolution de conflits d ' interpretations du monde , et sont soumises des conflits d ' interpretation . notes : selon "" semiotique - dictionnaire raisonne de la theorie du langage "" de greimas et courts , on distingue au moins deux acceptions de l ' interpretation , l ' interpretation comme attribution de significations des signes qui en sont depourvus et l ' interpretation comme paraphrase ( au sens large ) de signes deja remplis de significations . cette deuxieme acception fait echo au "" dictionnaire de la psychanalyse "" de laplanche et pontalies qui definit l ' interpretation comme degagement , par l ' investigation analytique , de sens latent dans le dire et les conduites d ' un sujet ; faisant donc reference a la fois au sens deja la et , en plus , sa modalite d ' obtention . soumission des contributions les propositions de communication , de 4 12 pages , devront parvenir en trois exemplaires ou sous forme electronique ( word attache vivement souhaite ) a l ' adresse suivante : christophe parisse , inserm , laboratoire de neuropsychologie de l ' enfant , batiment pharmacie 3eme etage , hopital de la salpetriere , 47 bd de l ' hopital , 75651 paris cedex 13 , france e - mail : parisse @ ext . jussieu . fr dates importantes reception des manuscrits : 31 septembre 1998 notification d ' acceptation : 9 novembre 1998 remise des versions finales : 10 decembre 1998

comparative method,"just as morris halle once pointed out that any phonological system could be analyzed as having two phonemes , so too it seems clear that any two languages , related or not , could have a reconstruction done for them , involving both a set of correspondences among the words or morphemes and a comparative grammar . and just as in fact a phonology with only two phonemes would be just a formal excersise and not a real phonology , so too the "" reconstruction "" i am referring to would have no validity unless the languages really are related ( or in the case of mixed languages , unless the relevant parts were related ) . but the formal possibility is important to the following extent : it shows that we cannot assume that the ability to write a comparative grammar is either necessary or sufficient for showing that the languages in question are related . it is the ability to write a convincing comparative gramm ` r that is significant here , but by the same token language relatedness can be sjown by establishing a convincing set of correspodences between suitable sets of words or morphemes of the languages being compared . i will even conceded that it is harder , in general , to be convincing in the case of a comparative grammar than it is in the case of a set of correspondences ( since the former would seem to include the latter plus a lot more ) . but what no one has yet shown here or anywhere else is that the only way to establish language relatedness is by writing a complete comparative grammar , and even meillet conceded by 1925 that you cannot even demand a fragment of a grammar because there are perfectly well-established families where this either has not been or indeed cannot be done . it is another matter 9and ultimately a more interesting one ) that significant amount of grammatical comparison ( though not a whole grammar ) has been offered for nostratic ( a theory i find likely though perhaps not yet established ) as well as for amerind ( a theory which i find basically as unsupported as do karl and victor , for example ) . and it is perhaps not uninteresting that illich - svitych proposed to write a nostratic comparative grammar but never did , much as sapirpromised to write one for uto - aztecan but failed to ( though we should in all fairness note that sapir lived for another two decades , whereas illich - svitych died without even finishing the lexical and morphemic comparisons which are the bulk of the evidence that we have in the public domain for nostratic ) . this is no criticism of sapir , of course , if we agree that there was no need to write a comparatve grammar of uto - aztecan in order for everybody to be able to see that the uto - aztecan languages are related . just as there is no need for this in the case of nostratic 9and indeed given the age of proto - nostratic , if there was such a language , it seems unlkikely that we will ever have more than a very partial grammar

workshop on embodied conversational characters,"the first workshop on embodied conversational characters granlibakken resort & conference center at lake tahoe tahoe city ( north shore ) california , usa october 12-15 , 1998 with the support of aaai cooperation of acm / sigchi call for papers recent advances in several core software technologies have made possible a new type of human-computer interface : the conversational character . conversational characters are autonomous , anthropomorphic , animated figures that have the ability to communicate through multiple modalities , including spoken language , facial expressions , and gestures . unlike textual natural language interfaces , conversational characters have the ability to perceive and produce the verbal and non-verbal signals that identify discourse structure and regulate the flow of information between interlocutors . such signals include intonational patterns , gestures , back-channel feedback signals , and turn-taking protocols . these capabilities enable them to engage in complex interactions with human users via natural speech rather than complex command languages , menus or graphical manipulations . research on conversational characters has emerged from a number of disciplines , including , among others , artificial intelligence , computational linguistics , computer animation , computer vision , psychology , cognitive science , virtual reality , cscw , and hci . this diversity is naturally reflected in the broad range of active research areas in conversational character interfaces . the primary goal of this workshop is to advance the state of conversational character research and development by identifying novel approaches to the topics and issues listed below , and integrating them into a framework for embodied , conversational human-computer interaction . selected contributors will be invited to expand and refine their papers for inclusion in a book to be published by addison - wesley . the aims of this book will be to introduce , define , and advance the field ; to give a snapshot of current work in it ; and to suggest future challenges and opportunities . particular topics of interest include , but are not limited to : * multi - modal interaction * autonomy * recognition & perception of speech , * behavior / dialogue planning gesture , facial expressions , etc . * distribution of semantic information * reactivity and opportunism across multiple modalities * rendering techniques * representation * semantic representations for * character individuation non-verbal communication * dialogue planning * affect and personality * turn - taking and back-channel signals * user studies * spoken language processing * tools for character * discourse structure building / authoring * intonation * architectures & applications papers should address one or more of these topics . demonstrations and video presentations of working systems are strongly encouraged . format the two and a half-day workshop will include several paper sessions , organized around emerging themes , with follow-up panel discussions . in addition , there will be a demonstration session for authors to present working systems . attendance attendance will be limited to 35-40 people . preference will be given to authors whose papers have been selected for presentation at the workshop . submission requirements paper submissions are due on june 15 , 1998 , and should be no longer than 6 pages ( 10-12 point font ) . upon acceptance , authors will be given the opportunity to expand their papers to 8-10 pages . electronic submissions in postscript or microsoft word formats are preferred , and should be sent to prevost @ pal . xerox . com . otherwise , send four hardcopies to : scott prevost attn : embodied conversational characters workshop fx palo alto laboratory 3400 hillview avenue , bldg . 4 palo alto , ca 94304 voice : 650 / 813-7701 deadlines submissions due june 15th notification of acceptance august 17th final papers due september 14th workshop october 12th - 15th workshop organizers joseph w . sullivan , fx palo alto lab , usa ( sullivan @ pal . xerox . com ) justine cassell , mit media laboratory , usa ( justine @ media . mit . edu ) workshop program committee committee co - chairs : scott prevost , fx palo alto lab , usa ( prevost @ pal . xerox . com ) elizabeth churchill , fx palo alto lab , usa ( churchill @ pal . xerox . com ) committee members : elisabeth andre , dfki gmbh , germany ( elisabeth . andre @ dfki . de ) gene ball , microsoft research , usa ( geneb @ microsoft . com ) phil cohen , oregon graduate institute , usa ( pcohen @ cse . ogi . edu ) barbara hayes - roth , stanford univ . , usa ( hayes-roth @ cs . stanford . edu ) kenji mase , atr international , japan ( mase @ mic . atr . co . jp ) clifford nass , stanford university , usa ( nass @ leland . stanford . edu ) mark steedman , university of pennsylvania , usa ( steedman @ cis . upenn . edu ) kris thorisson , lego a / s , denmark ( kris @ digi . lego . com ) demos chair : timothy bickmore , isii inc . , usa ( bickmore @ pal . xerox . com ) additional information for more information , please consult the workshop web page : www . fxpal . com / wecc98 /

"" pronounced "" quotation marks with two clicking sounds , accompanied by the finger sign you mentioned . this will surely not be the origin , but i saw many people imitating him since then . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * "" dr . christian k . nelson "" ( cnelson @ vm . cc . purdue . edu ) i ' m not sure , but think that what you ' re interested in might overlap with the phenomenon of "" reported speech , "" which bakhtin and his circle dealt with . perhaps there is a better reference for their work , but the one i ' m familiar with is v . n . volosinov 's ( 1973 ) _ marxism and the philosophy of language _ ( cambridge , ma : harvard univ . press ; l . matejka & i . r titunik , trans . ) . i should note that some believe this book was actually authored by bahktin , but bears volosinov 's name for political reasons . anyway , part 3 seems pertinent to your interests . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * philippe mennecier ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr the same phenomena exist in french : on a coutume de penser que les vrais hommes ( entre guillemets ) ne montrent pas leurs e / motions .

"" for "" for example "" , "" a k a "" for "" also known as "" , and latin abbreviations are often pronounced as written , such as "" et al "" for "" and others "" . the french "" a la "" used in the sense of "" after the fashion of "" is so commonly spoken that i now see it written as a word "" ala "" . the most common rendering of the written quotation marks here is a sort of quickly spoken compound word "" quoteunquote "" , as in , "" he 's not a quoteunquote * real * man . "" ( the emphasis always follows . ) business offices are full of spoken acronyms spoken such as "" cya "" ( from "" cover your ass "" ) to mean a nearly superfluous blame prevention precaution or fact verification measure one takes when doing a particular job ( "" do it as a cya "" or "" this is just a cya measure "" ) . "" kma "" from "" kiss my ass "" , in ad agencies , designates a job people have to do free on their own time , e . g . , because it 's for their boss 's favorite charity ( "" this is just a kma so do n't hurry . "" or "" it 's a kma job , but you still have to rush it , i ' m really sorry . "" ) asap "" as soon as possible "" is pronounced as a word sounding nearly like "" ass at "" . i suppose the classic case of such a thing is the originally military word "" snafu "" , which stood for "" situation normal - - all fucked up "" . check this if it 's useful , but i swear i heard people in the czech republic colloquially using the letters of their abbreviation "" atd . "" instead of the full "" a tak dale "" to mean "" for example "" . closer to what you ' re asking for would be the growing use of the phrase "" question mark "" over here to mean simply something unknown : "" this event leaves a big question mark over the whole project . "" you know , this phenomenon is n't only confined to speech . here is a sentence from the letters column of the january 30 , 1995 u . s . edition of time magazine : "" those of us who have to use pcs at work but choose to have macs at home know that macs , while not problem free , are far and away superior to pc compatibles , period ! "" notice this use of "" period "" followed by an exclamation point . the word period in this usage has been reanalysed to such a degree that it 's not uncommon in the u . s . to hear emphatic statements like the following : "" i ' m not going period ! exclamation point ! "" "" period "" has thus come to mean something like "" in any case "" . americans also say "" slash "" to designate "" / "" : "" he 's kind of a carpenter slash bricklayer . "" "" it 's more or less like a cafe slash bookshop . "" "" if he slash she has a gender , * i * sure can't tell ! "" we also say "" hyphen "" in a similar way : "" he 's an actor hyphen tennis pro . "" also do n't forget the emergence over the last 20 years or so of the term "" bottom line "" , describing the sum of an arithmetic problem or an accounting ledger , and used to mean "" the summation "" or "" the point of the matter "" . in the 1970s i heard it mainly in two set forms , the question , "" what 's the bottom line ? "" ( i . e . , what 's the point ? ) and a main clause "" the bottom line is that . . . "" ( i . e . , what i ' m getting at is . . . ) . now it 's become sort of a complementizer as well , so you hear things like : "" he gave me this big runaround about how his wife was sick , and he had to do overtime at work , and he 's got an exam coming , and all this crap , bottom line he 's not gonna come . "" i ' ve also heard people , who want to end useless heated discussion of something and move on to another point , yell things like , "" wait a minute ! . . . . . new paragraph ! "" some of this stuff almost sounds like people are thinking in comic strip images : "" there 's a question mark hanging over him . "" ( i . e . , his fate is uncertain ) . this is similar to idioms that most certainly have such origins , such as , "" i just saw a light bulb over your head . what 's your idea ? "" the germans read the comma aloud in their decimals much as we here say "" point "" , so american 1 . 0 "" one point zero "" would be german 1 , 0 "" eins komma null "" .

foreign language in commercials,"content - length : 1937 greetings ! i ' m wondering if someone out there can identify the languages used in two recent ibm commercials . they have out a series of three ads with people in different countries talking about ibm equipment and services . one ad has two old gentlemen walking along what looks like the seine , speaking french . a second ad has two men sitting in what is apparently a middle eastern marketplace , and a third ad has nuns discussing ibm equipment on their way to mass . i assume the men are speaking arabic ( though i would be grateful to have that confirmed ) , but i have no idea what the nuns are speaking . anyone know ? i would also like to take this opportunity to thank all those who responded to my questions early last year about some french , italian and swedish expressions in some print ads . i meant to send individual thanks , but i lost the file in which i had the respondents ! please forgive me , and accept this general acknowledgment instead . if any of you who did respond would like to know more about what we did with your input , i would be glad to send you more information ( even the paper we wrote , if you want ) . thanks very much , mary ellen renryder @ idbsu . idbsu . edu

cognitive linguistics,"theme session call for papers 6th international cognitive linguistics association ( icla ) conference ( stockholm , july 1999 ) typological research on signed languages : cognition and discourse structure session coordinators : sherman wilcox and terry janzen several hundred signed languages are known to exist in the world , used within communities in which the signed language is the primary language . most grammatical description of these languages , however , is not extensive , and is confined to no more than a handful of these languages . there is speculation that signed languages may share a significant number of linguistic features even when such languages are genetically unrelated , due in part to their common use of the hands and body as articulators and the eyes , rather than ears , as perceptual organs . very little actual work , however , has been carried out with respect to which specific grammatical features are shared , and which may differ . many questions surrounding the relationship between cognition and signed language structure involve the cross-linguistic typology of structural and semantic categories . it is not yet clear , however , whether certain linguistic features of signed languages emerge cross-linguistically because users of these languages employ similar articulatory and perceptual systems , and how much variation between and within particular categories exists . the purpose of this session is to focus on information processing and discourse structure as typological features among signed languages . a cognitive approach to this topic assumes that signers will structure their discourse to best represent and convey what is cognitively salient , and that the grammar that emerges within a community of language users will reflect this cognitive motivation . we invite papers which focus on cognition and features of discourse structure in a variety of signed languages , with the intention of facilitating discussion among researchers regarding typological features . abstracts ( 700 to 1400 words ) are invited , and should be submitted by november 31 to each of the following : wilcox @ unm . edu tjanzen @ post . rrcc . mb . ca = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = sherman wilcox , ph . d . associate professor dept . of linguistics university of new mexico albuquerque , nm 87131 http : / / www . unm . edu / ~ wilcox

sum : v - initial languages,"several weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre ' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian : the proto - austronesian consonant system has undergone considerable attrition in the polynesian languages , which today exhibit between eight and twelve consonants apiece . in hawaiian , in which proto - polynesian * / h / and * / ? / have been categorically lost , v - initial words appear to be rather common . but i could not find any explicit discussion of this , and my impression of such hawaiian texts as i could find is that the proportion of v - initial words probably does not approach 40 % , though i am ready to be corrected on this . niger-congo : initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan : a rough estimate suggests that catalan words are about 32 % v - initial , rather more than one might expect in a language with 7 vowels and 22 consonants , and more , i suspect , than are typically found in romance languages . i know of no particular reason for this . arawan ( amazonia ) : many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber : masculine - gender nouns regularly take a prefix / a - / , while feminine nouns take / ta - / . muskogean : these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan : these seem to have undergone heavy reduction of initials , not entirely unlike the australian initial-dropping languages , but the results have been complex . siouxan languages particularly show the lenition of initial / p [ h ] / > / f / > / h / , and possibly also some cases of / t [ h ] / > / h / . germanic : the change / k [ h ] / > / x / > / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions : ( 1 ) languages in which 40 % or more of nouns are v - initial are not exceedingly rare , but they do not appear to be at all common . the majority of the examples come from niger - congo . ( 2 ) in niger - congo , the initial vowels derive chiefly from morphological sources , probably entirely so apart from the reduction of cv - prefixes to v - in some languages . fossilized noun-class prefixes appear to be the most widely accepted origin in most cases , and such prefixes appear to be certain in some cases , in which the semantic value of the prefixes is still recoverable . but other morphological processes may be responsible in some other cases . ( 3 ) outside of niger - congo , there appears to be little evidence of morphological origins for initial vowels , and loss of initial consonants is more usually invoked . the consonants invoked are , unsurprisingly , more likely to be glottals than oral obstruents . ( 4 ) except perhaps in siouxan , there is little or no evidence for the systematic loss of initial voiceless plosives . so what happened in basque ? i still do n't know . the american long-ranger john bengtson has for years been defending the "" fossilized noun-class prefix "" view of the basque initial vowels , for reasons of his own , but there seems to be no trace of any semantic correlations with the initial vowels , and in fact the frequency of each of the five basque vowels appears to be about the same initially as elsewhere : a > e > i > o > u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i ' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk

3 . 417 citations,"i can't resist putting in my tuppence worth on chomsky 's citation record . here are my very informal observations of how he is treated by non ( theoretical ) linguists . ( 1 ) mathematical theory of formal languages . chomsky still gets cited almost automatically for his pioneering work on hierarchies of languages . ( 2 ) philosophy of language . c gets cited a lot for his nativist claims : his arguments are usually rejected . fodor 's much more radical nativism gets even more attention and even more rejection . c also gets cited a lot in discussions of wittgenstein , usually as an example of the sort of narrow formalist , rule-based view a language that wittgenstein consistently argued against . ( 3 ) psychology . c has frequently claimed that what he is doing is scientific psychology , but this has failed to impress psychologists . the competence / performance distinction , the autonomous language faculty assumption and the concern with ug all put c 's theoretical constructs beyond the ken of most experimental or empirical psychologists . ( 4 ) biology . it would interesting to know if * any * evolutionary biologists have taken up c 's views or tried to explain how they could be investigated . again , his views often get mentioned in general introductions . . . but only to be rejected . ( 5 ) cognitive science . as gardner showed in "" the mind 's new science "" , c was a source of inspiration . consequently he is cited very frequently in cognitive science literature . again , however , it is his formal , comptuational approach - not his genuinely linguistic work - that are referred to . so , although c is viewed as a founder of cognitive science , his current theory of grammar has had no real impact on the field . in general , it seems that most people outside of linguistics know of chomsky as he appears in "" aspects "" and in the non-technical parts of "" knowledge of language "" . it 's surely a safe bet that almost no non-linguist followed him into "" government and binding "" . - philip swann

linguistic theory and computational linguistics,"bod , rens ( university of amsterdam ) ; beyond grammar : an experience-based theory of language ; isbn : 1-57586 - 150 - x ( paper ) , 1-57586 - 151 - 8 ( cloth ) ; 184 pp . csli publications 1998 : http : / / csli-www . stanford . edu / publications / email : pubs @ roslin . stanford . edu . during the last few years , a new approach to linguistic analysis has started to emerge . this approach , which has come to be known under various labels such as "" data-oriented parsing "" , "" corpus-based interpretation "" and "" treebank grammar "" , embodies the assumption that human language comprehension and production works with representations of concrete past language experiences rather than with abstract grammatical rules . the models that instantiate this approach operate by decomposing the given representations into fragments and recomposing those pieces to analyze ( infinitely many ) new utterances . a probability model is used to choose from the collection of different fragments those that make up the most appropriate representation of an utterance . this book shows how this general approach can apply to various kinds of linguistic representations , ranging from phrase-structure trees , compositional semantic representations , dialogue representations , and lexical-functional grammar representations . the resulting models are utilized for the automatic acquisition of language , for harnessing ambiguity and for processing of spoken dialogue . experiments with these models suggest that the productive units of natural language cannot be defined by a minimal set of rules or principles , but need to be defined by a large , redundant set of previously experienced structures . bod argues that this outcome has important consequences for linguistic theory , leading to an entirely new view of the nature of linguistic competence and the relationship between linguistic theory and models of performance . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * csli publications ventura hall stanford university stanford , ca 94305-4115 telephone ( 650 ) 723-1839 fax ( 650 ) 725-2166 http : / / csli-publications . stanford . edu /

run-on words ?,"could anyone tell me why we have compound , run-on words in english orthography , like 's omething ' , 's omeone ' , ' therefore ' , ' whereas ' , ' everyone ' and so on ? is there any real linguistic phenomenon being captured here by omitting the usual word boundary in the spelling ? i find myself doing it with words like ' realtime ' and ' harddisk ' and i do n't know why . the reason i ask is that i have been working on a program which does syllable counting . these run-on words with the silent-e in the middle of the word cause the program to differ from human performance . it is easy to discount english syllable counting for a final ' e ' on a word with at least one other vowel cluster , but the silent-e in the middle of a word can only be done with a lookup table - - and that is a real drag for otherwise elegant programming . how would i know if i got all the run-ons listed or not ? does it get applied every time there is an ' e ' in the middle of a word ? stan . stankuli @ uwf . bitnet = = = : : close your eyes , my darling , or three of them at least - - - - - old venusian lullaby

"comparative syntax : two languages , one grammar ?","i previously posted this text to another mailing list ; a participant on that list , who also reads linguist , urged me to post it here as well , as a contribution to the "" comparative syntax "" discussion . the text below , set off by "" # "" in the left margin , is drawn from ) man 's many voices : language in its cultural context ( , by robbins burling ( new york : holt rhinehart & winston , 1970 ; isbn 0-03 - 081001-09 ) . # john gumperz has examined the colloquial dialects of marathi and kannada # in a village along the maharastra - mysore boundary in central india where # these two languages come into direct contact . marathi is an indo - aryan # language , while kannada is dravidian . historically these two languages # go back to utterly different antecedents , but the indo - aryan and dravidian # languages have been in contact in india for several thousand years and have # long influenced one another . along the borders their mutual influence has # been profound . in the village studied by gumperz most speakers feel # themselves to be bilingual , but the two village dialects share such a # large part of their grammar that one can almost doubt whether they should # count as separate languages . consider , for example , the following sentence : # # kannada : hog - i w @ nd kudri turg mar - i aw t @ nd # tags : verb suff . adj . noun noun verb suff . pron . verb # marathi : ja - un ek ghora cori kar - un tew anla # english : go having one horse theft take having he brought # idiomatic english : having gone and having stolen a horse , # he brought it back . # # all of the morphemes of the kannada sentence are different from those of # the marathi sentence , but they are used according to identical grammatical # principles . the sentences have identical constituent structures and their # morphemes occur in the same order . the same kind of suffixes are attached # to the same kind of bases . these sentences seem by no means to be atypical # of village usage . in fact , one can plausibly suggest that these two # languages ( if indeed they ) are ( two languages ) have the same grammar and # differ only in the items filling the surface forms . one can translate from # one language to another simply by substituting one set of lexical items for # another in the surface structure . # # both the marathi and the kannada used in this village differ from the more # literary or educated styles of the same languages , but both can be shown to # be related to the more standard forms according to the usual criteria by # which linguists recognize genetic affiliation . yet the village dialects # have undergone such profound mutual grammatical influence as to almost # obscure the boundaries between the two languages . curiously , in this case , # it is the lexicon that maintains the separation , and after considering the # effect of marathi and kannada upon each other , one can hardly maintain that # lexicon is always the easiest component of language to borrow or that the # true genetic affiliation will necessarily be shown by the underlying grammar burling 's bibliography refers to the following article ( which i have not read ) : gumperz , john j .

antipassive and reflexive,"some time ago , i posted a question asking whether people knew of languages that had both a reflexive morpheme ( attached to v ) and an antipassive morpheme ( attached to v ) , where the two were different . i received three replies which are included below in abbreviated form . i thank those who responded for their help : angela terrill , mike darnell , and suzanne kemmer * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * there are thirteen or so australian languages which have antipassives ( all pama - nyungan ) . of these , most use the same morphology as their reflexives . some languages have antipassive verbal morphology but no reflexive morphology . but the languages which have separate explicit verbal morphology for reflexives and antipassives are , including sources : * dyirbal ( around cairns ) marks antipassive with - ngay - . reflexive is rriy ~ yirriy ~ marriy ~ ( m ) barriy . dixon ( 1972 ) the dyirbal language of north queensland ( cambridge : cup ) * warungu ( west of dyirbal , not closely related ) has antipassive - gali - and reflexive - li - . probably historically related . t . tsunoda ( 1974 ) ' a grammar of the warungu language ' monash university ma thesis * kalkatungu ( western queensland ) has antipassive - yi - and reflexive - ti - . maybe historically related . b . j . blake ( 1979 ) a kalkatungu grammar ( canberra : pacific linguistics ) the proto - pama - nyungan ( and maybe proto - australian ? ) reflexive form is something like * - dhi - rri - , where dh is a laminal stop , either lamino-palatal or lamino-dental . the overwhelming majority of reflexive ( and antipassive ) markers in pama - nyungan languages are reflexes of this . the warungu and kalkatungu antipassive forms given above are probably reflexes of this also , but the dyirbal form definitely is n't ( although , interestingly , it is cognate with an applicative form in nearby yidiny ( dixon 1977 ) . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * does this work for you ? lix-t - 0 - as ta sitn put . dowm-trans - 3sgo - 3sga art basket he / she put down the basket . lix-m - 0 t-ta sitn put . down-intrans - 3sgs oblique case-art basket he / she put down the basket . now admittedly there are some complexities to this situation . some salish anists ( the examples from squamish , british columbia ) dispute the antipassive analysis in the second example , but putting that aside payaq-t - sut prepare-trans - reflexive he / she prepared himself / herself . this seems to fit your requirements , but i have a question . could the morpheme in your example , and perhaps in the case of others that you mention in passing , be a middle voice marker rather than reflexive . again , from squamish suk ' w-um ( the - um here is identical to the - m above ) bathe-intrans he / she bathes ( only himself or herself , a transitive reading requires the - - t , you saw above ) whatever the case with the examples that you ' ve seen squamish seems to have a morpheme for antipassive and middle , with a separate one for reflexive . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * a number of philippine languages have an antipassive that consists in detransitivizing the verb with a prefix and stripping the object of its 'd eterminer ' ( which marks case ) and other modifiers . the reflexive marker , on the other hand , is a completely different morpheme . kapampangan is a language of this type . another case , i would suggest , is languages whose former reflexive marker now codes antipassive , but which in the meantime have innovated a new reflexive marker . russian uses the suffix ' - sja ' on the verb ' bite ' to mean ' the dog bites ' ( generically ) and similar cases . but - sja is not the reflexive marker in russian . sebja is the productive reflexive marker . - sja does occur on verbs like ' wash ' , but these are not reflexive verbs - - languages tend to mark them differently from reflexives . my book "" the middle voice "" draws the reflexive-middle distinction and documents it from many languages . jeff lidz university of delaware office : ( 302 ) 831-6489 department of linguistics home : ( 302 ) 656-1902 46 e . delaware ave . email : jlidz @ brahms . udel . edu newark , de 19716

ellipsis in conjunction,"call for papers , focus group , zas , berlin , oct . 2 - 3 , 1998 workshop on ellipsis in conjunction in view of the growing interest in conjunction ellipsis this workshop is an attempt to promote the communication and bridge the gaps between different approaches within the framework of generative syntax . the workshop will concentrate on the following issues : ( 1 ) the structure of a conjunction construction . is the base-generated structure of a coordinate construction a double-headed structure ( williams 1994 ) , or does it have the second conjunct right-adjoined to the first conjunct ( reinhart 1991 ) , or is it a projection of a conjunction word ( &p ) ( munn1987 ) , or something else ? ( 2 ) the possible categories to be conjoined . must a conjunct be a clause or an extended projection ( excluding smaller xp - types ) ? must a conjunct be an xp ( excluding head and x ' ) ? and how are ' asymmetrical coordinations ' analyzed if only ' like ' categories can be conjoined ? ( 3 ) the analyses of ellipsis and gapping constructions . the verb gapping construction , for instance , has been analyzed as rightward np movement followed by an identical constituent deletion ( jayaseelan 1990 ) , across - the - board verb movement ( johnson 1996 ) , and deletion licensed in lf ( wilder 1997 ) . in addition , it remains to be shown how to account for the relationships between vp ellipsis , pseudogapping and gapping . furthermore , a general study of sluicing is required to cover wh in-situ languages where slucing does not alternate with an overt movement to eliminate strong features of a wh question ( lasnik 1997 ) . ( 4 ) the analysis of similarities and differences among various types of reduction . how and why do coordinative , comparative , and exception conjunction ellipses share properties and differ from each other syntactically , and / or semantically ? are the properties of forwad deletion and backward deletion related to lf and pf respectively , as claimed by wilder ( 1997 ) ? ( 5 ) the constraints on the ellipsis constructions . what are the language-specific properties that might interact with the representations of conjunction ellipsis ? are there any ellipsis or gapping rules in ug ? ( 6 ) the connection between conjunction ellipsis and information structure . to what extent are such ellipses determined by information structural aspects like focus background structuring ? ( 7 ) studies of conjunction ellipsis of a greater variety of languages . invited speakers : danny fox tilman hoehle kyle johnson jason merchant alan munn craig thiersch chris wilder organizers : kerstin schwabe , niina zhang , horst - dieter gasde , and andre meinunger the deadline for receipt of abstracts is july 1 , 1998 . please send your abstract ( 1 a4 / letter - size max ) to : dr . niina zhang zas jaegerstr . 10-11 10117 berlin germany tel : 49-30 - 20192572 fax : 49-30 - 20192402 email : ellipsis @ zas . gwz-berlin . de we accept abstracts by fax , email , as well as regular mail . the selection of the abstracts for presentation will be finished by the end of august . zentrum fur allgemeine sprachwissenschaft ( zas ) http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de

language as metaphor & metaphors for language - - session at aaa 98,"i have volunteered to organize the following session for the next meeting of the society for linguistic anthropology at aaa 98 ( next winter in washington ) : language as metaphor and metaphors for language metaphor has been shown to be an integral component of the way we conceptualize experience and embody it in language . but metaphor can also be thought of as a specific tool that can be used in a variety of disciplines : a concrete image can summarize or illuminate the object of study , and sometimes even inform the direction of the discipline . new theories give rise to new metaphors , and the study of such metaphors can throw light on the development of theories . papers are invited from both linguists and non-linguists on two topics : 1 ) language used as metaphor : for a restricted communicative code used concurrently with language : e . g . the language of flowers ; but also for various characteristics of expressive or cognitive domains , e . g . the grammar / syntax / vocabulary of architecture , music , etc . ; what characteristics of language are used metaphorically ? to what do they correspond in other domains ? what is the usefulness of language metaphors for the domains in question ? 2 ) language as object of metaphor : what can language be compared to ? explicit ( e . g . neo-grammarian ' family tree ' ; saussure 's game of chess ; the city ) and implicit ( ? ) metaphors for language ; what do such metaphors reveal about language and how speakers view it ? how do metaphors for language relate to directions in linguistics ? please contact me : marie - lucie tarpent , mount st vincent u , halifax , n . s . b3m 2j6 canada ; 902-457 - 6172 ; marie-lucie . tarpent @ msvu . ca .

summary : basic order ( and remarks on typology ),"last week i asked for references to discussions of a problem that comes up in linguistic typology : when there are conflicting or ambiguous criteria for deciding whether a particular language is a particular ' type ' with respect to some feature ( word order , clause alignment , or whatever ) , how does one decide how to assign that language ? i would like to thank the following for their helpful replies : george huttar , yehuda falk , dan everett , larry trask , jon aske , mike maxwell , mark newson , bill croft , georgia green , ingo plag , randy harris , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy . i was quite surprised at the small amount of published attention that there is to this problem . i was pointed to short discussions ( no more than a couple pages ) in some of the major works devoted to typology : the seminal greenberg paper , comrie 's ' language universals and linguistic typology ' , croft 's ' typology and universals ' , and hawkins ' ' word order universals ' . it was also suggested that i look at doris payne 's ' the pragmatics of word order ' and to papers on yagua by payne and dan everett and on tzotzil by judith aissen . what prompted my query was a reading of johanna nichols ' linguistic diversity in space and time , which i found extremely impressive . but all through it i had an uneasy feeling caused by her pigeon-holeing languages as ' svo ' , ' head-marking ' , ' active-stative ' , or whatever . since so many languages are * not * transparently one particular ' type ' on the surface , i wondered what the basis for these type-characterizations was . there is no general answer given to this question for an obvious reason : neither nichols or anyone else could have profound first-hand knowledge of more than a small handful of the 174 languages in the data base . i suspect that in most cases nichols could not know what criteria were applied to type a language in the sources she consulted , because many sources are insufficiently explicit on that point or take as self-evident some categorization that another would take as controversial or simply wrong . ( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .

nominal expressions,"first announcement and call for papers ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ esslli-99 workshop on the generation of nominal expressions university of utrecht , the netherlands 9-13 august 1999 context : the workshop will take place in association with the 11th european summer school "" logic linguistics and information "" ( esslli ) , to be held in utrecht , the netherlands , from 9-20 august 1999 . the format of the workshop is 5 x 90 minutes on the 5 consecutive days of 9 to 13 august 1999 . the esslli summer school is organized under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . previous esslli summer schools have been highly successful , attracting around 500 students from europe and elsewhere . the school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . for more information see http : / / esslli . let . uu . nl . workshop description : if someone attempted to assess the ` state of the art ' of linguistic research on nominal expressions by looking at how present-day programs generate nominals , he or she would no doubt underestimate gravely the level of sophistication of theoretical work on nominals . it can be argued that this is because existing work on the computational generation of nominals has limited itself to relatively simple nominals , often focussing on simple ( singular ) definite descriptions and pronouns . alternatively , it might be contended that much of the theoretical work in this area is not mature enough to be appicable in generation . be this as it may , work on the generation of nominals has not profited much from theoretical research in formal semantics and psycholinguistics on the meaning , interpretation and production of nominal expressions . this workshop will try to bridge the gap between theory and practice in this area by focusing on the generation of nominal expressions of different linguistic types including , for example , indefinite and quantificational nps ( of different monotonicity types ) . the theme of the workshop is closely related to that of a number of ongoing research projects , including the gnome ( ` generation of nominal expressions ' ) project , in which the itri ( brighton ) and hcrc ( edinburgh / durham ) collaborate , and which is funded by the epsrc in the united kingdom . topics for which submissions are invited include : ( 1 ) the influence of discourse context on the appropriateness and interpretation of a nominal expression ( 2 ) descriptive issues concerning the treatment of plurality , bridging , aggregation , eventualities , reference to text , cross-modal reference , etc . ( 3 ) representational issues ( i . e . , what kind of meaning representations should form the input to the generation algorithm ? ) ( 4 ) reversibility of grammars ( 5 ) differences in textual style or ` genre ' ( 6 ) psycholinguistic research relevant to computational natural language generation ( nlg ) ( 7 ) corpus - based work leading to insights relevant for computational nlg ( 8 ) issues of system / algorithm evaluation . practical issues : we welcome short ( i . e . , roughly 1000-1500 words ) electronic submissions ( send email to rodger . kibble @ itri . brighton . ac . uk ) on the theme of the workshop . submissions should be in postscript or plain ascii . please include "" esslli99 "" in the subject line of your message to make things easy for us . in accordance with the description of the workshop description , we encourage submissions about theoretical ( e . g . , formal semantic or psycholinguistic ) , applied , or corpus-based work , as long as the work is clearly relevant for nlg programs . no matter what they consider the main focus of their work , we ask authors to * stress relevance for nlg * in their submission ( and , later , in their presentation ) . this will ensure that all contributions will contain a common ` core ' , notwithstanding their differences in perspective . it is esslli 's practice to make sure that workshops go ahead only if there turns out to be a sufficient level of interest , based on quantity and quality of submissions . workshop speakers are required to register for the summer school ; however , workshop speakers will be able to register at a reduced rate to be determined by the organizing committee . limited funds are available to contribute to speakers ' expenses in exceptional circumstances . important dates : - first call for papers : 22 october 1998 - deadline for submissions of abstracts : 1 march 1999 - notification of acceptance : 1 may 1999 - workshop to be held : august 9-13 for any questions , please contact the organizers or consult our web page at < http : / / www . itri . brighton . ac . uk / projects / gnome / esslli99 . html > which will shortly be available . rodger kibble & kees van deemter information technology research institute ( itri ) university of brighton lewes road , watts building brighton bn2 4gj united kingdom email : rodger . kibble @ itri . brighton . ac . uk kees . van . deemter @ itri . brighton . ac . uk fax : + 44 1273 642908",0

q : processing of japanese text / database ; word frequencies,"i am posting this on behalf of a colleague who is not on the list . she is going to perform psycholinguistic experiments on japanese morphology and needs a number of things for her preparatory work . first of all she needs to find dictionaries or ( preferred ) lexical databases which contain reliable and _ recent _ information on word frequencies ( her main emphasis will be on verb morphology ) ; we already know of one dictionary but this is at least forty years old . can anyone on the list point us to such dictionaries or databases ? - if not , is anyone aware of machine-redable corpora of japanese texts of everyday use ( papers , magazines ) from which she could extract the desired frequencies ? our next problem is to find windows ( truetype or atm ) - fonts of kanj and kana alphabets ( kana would be the more important ) , because these are input to the software that handles the experiments . we are aware of njstar for dos and "" jwp "" , a ' japanese word processor ' for windows , which would suffice as a word processor as such , but it uses an internal font format to which our onversion tool has no access . besides of that having truetype fonts would make building our own databases a lot easier , because we would be able to use windows standard-software , so far we have only been informed of a rather adventurous way of feeding the output of a dos database into njstar to print index cards in a library . by the way - i have heard of a japanese edition of aldus ' pagemaker - does it come with fonts ? we would be grateful for any hint and we promise to post a summary . thanks in advance christian * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * christian kissing dept . of linguistics universitaet duesseldorf home : universtaetsstrasse 1 neusser strasse 17 d-40225 duesseldorf 50670 koeln tel . : + 49 + 211 / 311-4797 0221 / 779061 fax . : + 49 + 211 / 311-5180 email : kissing @ ling . uni-duesseldorf . de * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"sycophants : fig "" show-ers "" ?","i do n't do much etymology , but : several readers have claimed that _ sicophant _ is derived from the greek words for ' fig ' ( sikos ) and 's how ' ( phaino : ) . the first part is surely correct , but the second seems problematic , since the relevant participle forms of _ phaino : _ would be present _ phainont - _ and aorist _ phanont - _ . without a greek grammar or dictionary at hand , i would suggest rather that we look at the athematic greek verb _ phe : mi _ ( doric _ pha : mi ) 's peak ' , which does have a participle _ phant - _ . so maybe the sicophant is the ' fig-talker ' rather than the ' fig-shower ' . the semantic connection , of course , would be that his words were sweet to the ear ; and certainly sicophants do more sweet-talking than fig-showing . what do you think ? has this etymology been proposed ? and if it has been proposed and rejected , why ? leo a . connolly foreign languages & literatures university of memphis connolly @ msuvax . memphis . edu formerly "" memphis state university ""

new books in psycholinguistics & neurolinguistics,"the ascent of babel : an exploration of language , mind , and understanding gerry t . m . altmann , university of york "" altmann has written a cross between a textbook for beginning psycholinguistic students and a popular science book for laypersons . . . . altmann explains in lay terms what psycholinguistics is and how its findings affect what we know of human experience . "" - - booklist language is one of the faculties that sets humans apart from animals , the crucial thing which makes our complex social interactions possible . it is a faculty which demands fantastically intricate mental and physical coordination , yet babies possess a remarkable ability to learn its complexities from a very early age . the ascent of babel explores the ways in which the mind produces and understands language : the ways in which the sounds of language evoke meaning , and the ways in which the desire to communicate causes us to produce those sounds to begin with . the "" ascent "" symbolises different things : the progression from sound to meaning , the ascent that we each undergo , from birth onwards , as we learn our mother tongue , and the quest to understand the mental processes which underlie our use of language . gerry altmann leads the reader on this ascent , which comprises a fascinating tour : from how babies learn language and how we discriminate between different sounds , through comprehension of the sounds and structures of language ( and the pitfalls along the way ) , to the production of spoken and written language , the effects of brain damage on language , and finally the ways in which computer simulations of interconnecting nerve cells can learn language . it is a journey of discovery , written in an engaging and witty style , at the end of which it becomes clear that babel 's summit - the secret of language - may actually lie at its foundations , where babies play and language is learned . december 1997 272 pp . ; 46 linecuts 0-19 - 852378 - 5 $ 27 . 50 oxford university press cognitive foundations of grammar bernd heine , university of cologne , germany the main function of language is to convey meaning . therefore , argues bernd heine in these pages , the question of why language is structured the way it is must first of all be answered with reference to this function . linguistic explanations offered in terms of other exponents of language structure ( for example , syntax ) are likely to highlight peripheral or epi-phenomenal - - rather than central - - characteristics of language structure . heine provides a solid introductory treatment of the ways in which language structure ( that is , grammar ) and language usage can be explained with reference to the processes underlying human conceptualization and communication . exploring an area of linguistics that has developed only recently and is rapidly expanding , cognitive foundations of grammar will appeal to students of linguistics , psychology , and anthropology , especially those interested in grammaticalization processess . november 1997 200 pp . ; 11 linecuts 0-19 - 510252 - 5 paper $ 19 . 95 0-19 - 510251 - 7 cloth $ 45 . 00 oxford university press narrative comprehension : a discourse perspective catherine emmott , university of glasgow there has so far been relatively little research by cognitive linguists on the comprehension of narrative texts . this book draws on insights from discourse analysis and artificial intelligence to explore how readers construct and maintain mental representations of fictional characters and contexts , and goes on to consider the implications of cognitive modelling for grammatical theory and a literary-linguistic model of narrative text-types . june 1997 336 pp . ; 5 text-figures 0-19 - 823649 - 2 $ 80 . 00 oxford university press the inheritance and innateness of grammars edited by myrna gopnik , mcgill university , canada ( vancouver studies in cognitive science 6 ) is language somehow innate in the structure of the human brain , or is it completely learned ? this debate is still at the heart of linguistics , especially as it intersects with psychology and cognitive science . in collecting papers which discuss the evidence and arguments regarding this difficult question , the inheritance and innateness of grammars considers cases ranging from infants who are just beginning to learn the properties of a native language to language-impaired adults who will never learn one . these studies show that , while precursors of language exist in other creatures , the abilities necessary for constructing full-fledged grammars are part of the biological endowment of human beings . the essays that comprise this volume test the range and specificity of that endowment , while also contributing to our understanding of the intricate and complex relationship between language and biology . june 1997 240 pp . ; 44 linecuts 0-19 - 511534 - 1 paper $ 29 . 95 0-19 - 511533 - 3 cloth $ 60 . 00 oxford university press for more information about linguistics titles from oxford university press : e-mail : linguistics @ oup-usa . org or visit the oxford university press usa web site : http : / / www . oup-usa . org oxford university press usa

postposed position is reserved for information that is ' new ' in one of a small number of distinct senses ; and argument-reversing constructions require that the information represented by the preverbal constituent be at least as familiar within the discourse as that represented by the postverbal constituent . within each of the three classes of constructions , individual constructions vary with respect to whether they are sensitive to familiarity within the discourse or ( assumed ) familiarity within the hearer 's knowledge store . thus , although the individual constructions in question are subject to distinct constraints , this work provides empirical evidence for the existence of strong correlations between sentence position and information status . the final chapter presents crosslinguistic data showing that these correlations are not limited to english . the structure of the lexicon in functional grammar hella olbertz , kees hengeveld & jesus sanchez garcia ( eds . ) ( university of amsterdam ) 1998 . xii , 312 pp . studies in language companion series , 43 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 929 5 price : usd 69 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3046 3 price : nlg 138 , - - the papers collected in this volume concern five different aspects of the role of the lexicon in the theory of functional grammar as developed by simon c . dik and his co-workers . the volume starts off with a practical introduction to the functional - lexematic model and model applications to english , german and spanish are presented . the second part of the volume deals with the derivation of action-nouns , pseudo-reflexive verbs and causative constructions , thus offering new perspectives on predicate formation within functional grammar . this is followed by a section that centers around an important problem related to valency : the question of how to account for the collocational properties of predicates . the fourth part of the book discusses ( non-prototypical ) transitive verbs and their relation to the typology of states of affairs . the final section focuses on the relationship between the lexicon and the underlying structure of the clause . check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /

sum : particle movement,"dear linguist listers , about a month ago i posted a query regarding literature on ' particle movement ' in english or , to be more precise , literature on factors contributing to the position of the particle in transitive phrasal-verb constructions such as ( 1 ) a . john brought back the book . b . john brought the book back . in the beginning , i 'd like to thank very much all of those who responded and shared their knowledge with me . apart from some very valuable hints i even received offers to send me unpublished papers or to share the up to now unpublished results of recent research concerning the topic in question . additionally , some answers were suggestions concerning methodological matters or exceptions from the rules generally cited . now that i have managed to mail my answers to all of them individually ( my sincere apologies to those who had had to wait unexpectedly long for their answers ) i want to post the summary of all those who contributed to my research followed by their suggestions or references ( in alphabetical order ) : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - aarts , bas ( b . aarts @ ucl . ak . uk ) : dear stefan gries , regarding your query on linguist , you may want to have a look at a paper of mine in the journal of linguistics , 25 . 2 , 1989 , 277-290 : ` verb - preposition constructions and small clauses in english ' ( and references cited there ) . this article also appears in modified form in my book _ small clauses in english : the nonverbal types _ . new york and berlin : mouton de gruyter . 1992 . hope this is helpful . bas aarts cameron , richard ( rcameron @ uic . edu ) for an article which investigates "" the factors contributing to the position of the particle "" , see : kroch , anthony and cathy small . 1978 . grammatical ideology and its effect on speech . in david sankoff ( ed . ) linguistic variation : models and methods . new york : academic press . pp . 45-55 . good luck . richard cameron durham . linguistics @ durham . ac . uk ( durham linguistics ) you might like to look at : johnson , k . 1991 . object positions . _ natural language and linguistic theory _ 9 : 577-636 . fischer , susan ( currently : fischer @ sal . tohoku . ac . jp ) i did my 1971 - 2 mit dissertation on the acquisition of verb-particle constructions as well as double-object constructions in english . i do not have a copy of my dissertation ( the acquisition of verb - particle and dative constructions ) with me here on sabbatical , but the main point of the structure chapter was that unstressed pronoun direct objects are cliticized to the verb - - so you must say "" i gave it up "" rather than "" i gave up it "" . however , if the pronoun has inherent or contrastive stress , the particle can intervene between the verb and the object : "" ok i gave up that a long time ago "" , "" i gave up him , he did n't give up me . "" good luck with your work . susan fischer foster , joseph f . ( joseph . foster @ uc . edu ) mr . gries , re your query on linguist re bring np back and structures of that ilk , i believe chomsky actually used this as one of his examples motivating transformations in syntactic structures . nelson francis also did in his structure of american english which was basically an immediate constituent analysis a la rulon wells . my chief reason for returning your signal however is to let you know if you do n't already ( as your signal suggests you may not ) that there is certainly a dialect of english in which the particle must always follow a pronoun direct object . thus your ( 2 ) b * * * john picked up him . is never grammatical in my english ( i speak natively ozark english but am fluent in standard southern american and pretty fair in midwestern . ) even if the him be contrastively stressed , it can never follow the particle . on the other hand , your 1 a and b are both ok . joe foster fraser , bruce ( bfraser @ bu . edu ) if you get any answers to your query , i would appreciate learning of the article . good luck . bruce fraser hagstrom ( hagstrom @ scf . usc . edu ) try hawkins ' "" performance theory of order and constituency "" cambridge university press 1994 for a processing approach to word order . cynthia hawkins , john ( hawkins @ almaak . usc . edu ) hi stefan : i saw your question on the linguist list re particle positioning . i have quite a bit of discussion on the ordering of verb , particle and np in my 1994 book a performance theory of order and constituency , cup , pp . 180-182 , and also some textual data . in the meantime i have collected a whole bunch more data , and have examined the constituent structure of v-np - part sequences in greater detail , and have found ordering evidence for two quite distinct structures here : one i analyze as a predication structure in which the part is semantically a predication ( e . g . lift the child up = the child is up ) ; one in which it is not and which i analyze as a discontinuous verb-particle structure ( look the number up does not equal the number is up ) . the proposed constituency difference predicts different orderings in conjunction with the basic ordering principle of my book ( early immediate constituents ) . i have n't got this stuff written up yet , but i ' ll be happy to share it with you when i have . best wishes , john hawkins kemmer , suzanne e . ( kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu ) i ' m happy to hear you ' re going to work on english particles . i do n't have any references to give you , only a suggestion : the generative work on particles was not very empirical , and never actually looked at the distribution of the verb adjacent vs . the postnominal particle . the distribution is highly lexically governed . ( for example , i have many times heard ' look over it ' instead of ' look it over ' , although all the generative literature assumes only ' look it over ' , because of the pronoun . the fact is , ' look over ' is coalescing into a single unit that overrides the pronoun-first preference . ) so , my suggestion is , get yourself a concordance program and actually look at large samples of english . it 's true , it will be written data ( unless you have a spoken corpus ) , and as such more conservative and somewhat less open to the innovations people actually make ; but some real generalizations will emerge . you can search on the various particles ( throwing out the prepositional uses ) and get an idea of which verbs like which particles . ( if you need suggestions on inexpensive concordance programs , let me know ) good luck , suzanne mills , carl ( carl . mills @ uc . edu ) at the 21st forum of the linguistic association of canada and the united states ( lacus ) , i presented a paper entitled "" ' obligatory particle movement ' in english , "" which is available on pp . 195-204 of the papers from the 21st lacus forum , ed . by mava jo powell . i wrote the paper because i had come across several examples in normal english conversation that violated your starred example : ( 2 ) a . john picked him up . b . * john picked up him . because these were examples that i overheard , some on national public radio , i knew that your stipulation "" ( 2b ) is starred unless ' him ' is contrastively stressed "" did not hold : the pronoun around which the particle was supposed to have been "" moved "" was not contrastively stressed . within a matter of days , i overheard three sentences : he wanted to help out them . he went in the house and put down something . can you ring up this ? i added 21 more sentences , some that i made up and some that had been starred in various linguistics publications , and conducted an acceptability judgment survey using a written questionnaire . statistically , the results indicated that speakers accept the sort of rule that underlies your starring of ( 2b ) above , but they do n't always obey the rule . there is more , but you can read the paper for that . good luck . carl mills nathan , geoff ( geoffn @ siu . edu ) dear stefan , a number of years ago we had a student work on this problem , and she wrote a thesis using an early version of cognitive grammar . she finished her thesis , and unfortunately dropped out of linguistics - - i do n't even know where she is now . but i could send you a copy of her thesis if that would be of use to you . best , geoff nathan nolan , brian ( bnolan @ iol . ie ) you may find what you need in the works of talmy , listed below . talmy explores the windowing of attention and the linguistic correlates which pertain to this phenonema . he explains how we can bring to attention , or focus , certain features in a dialogue and how these can manifest themselves linguistically via foregrounding and backgrounding , gapping etc . , etc . talmy 's ( 1996a ) , or his ( 1985 ) work is probably a good place to start talmy , leonard .

"" the book back "" would be a small clause , in your example ) and relates particle shift to heavy np shift ; the particle moves to the right when it is phonologically "" heavy "" . i adopted the small clause configuration from kayne but criticized the heavy np shift approach to the word order variation in a 1992 article , and proposed a technical syntactic solution for particle shift ( based on the particle "" incorporating "" into the verb ) . den dikken , in his 1992 dissertation ( later published as den dikken 1995 ) agreed with my rejection of kayne 's analysis but tendered some accurate criticism of my approach , and offered a different syntatic analysis , which also adopts the small clause structure but which in which shift is characterized as np movement across the particle for case reasons . in my 1994 dissertation , i accept den dikken 's criticism of my 1992 analysis but show some evidence that the base structure he assumes is incorrect . i propose another syntactic account based on two alternative movements ; either the particle moves or the np moves . in later work i have developed this approach and extended it to the scandinavian languages . i have one article published in 1996 in working papers in scandinavian syntax and a longer one that has n't been published anywhere ( yet ! ) . i also have a review of den dikken 's book published in the journal language . two additional recent references are johnson 's 1991 ( ? ) article in natural language and linguistic theory , in which the verb plus particle start out as a constituent , and the verb moves from the particle ( as in most analyses of german and dutch ) , and collins & thrainsson 's 1996 linguistic inquiry article , in which the particle first moves up to attach to the verb , as in my 1992 article , and then the verb moves away , as in johnson . all of the above works deal to some extent with the basic pattern of shift , which is that pronouns precede the particle and modified particles ( and particles with complements ) follow the noun phrase - - with greater or lesser degrees of success . for example , pronouns are often considered to have special properties with respect to case , and this has been exploited in several of the above works . in my dissertation , i speculate somewhat inconclusively that the special positioning of pronouns may be due to their prosodic lightness , and i expand on that possibility in the wpss article , where i show that destressed nps are best before the particle , while stressed nps are better after the particle , e . g . ( 1 ) how with the girls get here ? a . i ' ll pick the girls up b . * i ' ll pick up the girls c . i ' ll pick up the girls ( 2 ) who will you pick up ? a . i ' ll pick up the girls b . * i ' ll pick the girls up c . i ' ll pick the girls up in each case , the ( a ) example is best , because the natural right-edge pitch increase coincides with an element that is not old information . the ( b ) examples are bad because salient old information should not be stressed . the ( c ) examples are acceptable , because sentence stress does n't fall on the old information , but are less good than the ( a ) examples , because the stress has been shifted away from the right edge of the sentence . in the article i provide a technical formal account of this fact . the same kind of account might extend to the pronouns and modified particles , but some more work is needed , since examples with particle before pronoun or modified particle after np are worse than the ( c ) examples above , even with stress shift to the left . however , the fact that stress on a pronoun ( or coordination of pronouns , which also makes them phonologically heavy ) allow it to follow the particle suggests a prosodic account . i realize this has been rather breezy , but it 's because i do n't know how much of it really is of interest to you . if you me to expand on something , just ask . if you want more complete references , or if you would like me to send any of my own papers , i 'd be happy to oblige . best , peter svenonius - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - again , thanks very much to all of you stefan th . gries

see if this doesn ' t interest you . . . .,"read the 1st paragraph ! if you are convinced that this is not for you , then delete it . my bet is that you will be intrigued enough to finish reading it before you make your decision . financial success brochure dear fellow advertiser : my name is tim brody and i make a living selling a recipe for potato cheese pierogies . this is all i do , and i earn in excess of $ 100 , 000 each year . incredible you say ? now , i am revealing my secret to you . incredible , you say ? it is completely legal and , you too , can be well on your way to earning $ 100 , 000 per year by selling your product , plans , recipe or information through the mail . before i reveal my plan to you , let me tell you a little about myself . five years ago , i placed a classified ad in a food magazine to earn a little extra money . my response was 11 orders and 43 "" get rich quick "" schemes . now , please don t laugh , over the next three years i tried all of those "" get rich quick "" schemes . some actually met with success while many met with complete failure . with each try , i learned something new about marketing my product . finally , this plan came together and in the first 3 months , i made over $ 25 , 000 . after i tried it again , i earned $ 35 , 000 and it became clear to me that i was on my way to financial freedom . now please , this story is not merely to brag . i want you to realize the hard work , persistence and expense that went in to making this program a success . it is also my way of teaching others the problems of many marketing plans , and , hopefully , they will be able to avoid many of my own mistakes and expenses . this program is not for everyone . if you are planning to make a million dollars or to compete with your fellow participants , then this plan is not for you . however , if earning $ 100 , 000 a year in a stress-free program interests you , please read on , you are among the sincere people needed to make this program a success . maybe you have participated in some of those "" get rich quick "" programs before . you probably were dissatisfied with your response rate from the classifieds or mailings ? were you expecting to receive additional income but didn t even receive enough responses to pay for the ad or the stamps ? if you are like others , the answer is yes ! please do not give up hope just yet . there is a way to make money and have fun , as well as fine tune your culinary taste . join a network of buyers and sellers with similar goals for no additional costs . the process is called multi - level marketing and it is not illegal . ( see section 18 , title 1301 , 1302 & 1342 of the us postal and lottery code . ) it is a modified plan similar to that of companies such as tupperware and mary kay . best of all , it can earn advertisers like ourselves , thousands in a few months . what exactly is multi-level marketing ( mlm ) ? mlm requires that you send letters to fellow advertisers ( we will help you with the addresses ) asking that they buy your product with the understanding that once they do , they will be included as a member of your program . ( just as tupperware or avon requests salespeople to buy their products to "" show "" to their customers . ) the letter you send always has your name on it along with 2 - 8 advertisers . it is based on this premise : ( assuming a 3 member list and a 100 % response ) level # 1 - you send out 20 letters with your name in the # 1 position . 20 people reply . level # 2 - those 20 replies send out letters with your name in the # 2 position . 400 people reply level # 3 - those 400 replies send out letters with your name in the # 3 position . 8000 people reply . you receive a total of 8 , 420 replies and are unable to receive more , because once your name reaches the bottom of any list , it is eliminated and replaced by new members . if you asked for $ 10 for your product , you earn $ 84 , 000 . of course a 100 % response rate is unrealistic , instead expect between $ 35 , 000 and $ 60 , 000 . now , before you decide that this is the dumbest thing you have ever heard of and decide to throw this away , please look at the statistic : 91 % of all classified advertisers join one or more of these programs . why ? because they are sincere in wanting to make money ! otherwise , they would not have advertised in the beginning . knowing this fact , i know that you would like to read on . by now , you have received many letters of this type . this alone should prove that these programs are working . do me a favor , save this and all of the other letters . when you have the time , sit down and compare all the programs . your financial success depends on your making the best choice . if you are like most newcomers , your first instinct is to join the program that offers the most money or offers the cheapest price per product . before you do this , i ask that you think and answer the following questions about each program : 1 . how many participants are on the list ? the more names there are , the more responses you will need . an average 8 person list requires 1 , 500 , 000 responses before obtaining $ 100 , 000 for each participant . a 3 member list needs 3 , 500 responses . 2 . how much do i receive per product ? if you join a $ 2 . 00 plan , know beforehand that you will need 5 times the amount of replies as a $ 10 . 00 program . the $ 2 . 00 plan will also take 6 months longer for you to receive big money , obviously because you need more responses . 3 . do the words cheat-proof and monitored appear on the plan ? if the program is based on honesty and integrity alone , it will fail . face it , when it comes to money , very few people can be honest . cheat - proof means that there is a way to insure that every member gets paid . whereas monitored means that members are watching to make certain that the list never gets altered . this can be done ! also know that you are receiving many $ 2 . 00 plans , not because they are popular , but because the members must keep resending information to meet their goals . . . only 6 % of all advertisers join $ 2 . 00 programs . you probably have received only a few $ 5 and $ 10 programs . these plans work ! there is no need to send hundreds of letters and monitoring is effective . 4 . how much money do i want to earn , and how much is my initial investment ? if you want to earn $ 50 , 000 for example , know that you need 25 , 000 $ 2 . 00 responses . when you figure your investment , make sure it includes printing and stamps . if a plan will not accept checks , it is not legitimate . finally , narrow your choices and choose the best program to suit your needs . hopefully , you will see that , like 76 % of us , this one is the best choice . our program this is a cheat-proof 3 - level plan . we pay $ 10 for the product of each member on the list . you will only be required to send out 20 letters ( how to get names is supplied ) and your total investment is $ 40 ( including postage and printing ) . you only need 4 replies throughout the entire program and you ve lost nothing ! plus , we offer a bonus plan in which you can earn $ 20 , 000 more with no extra effort ! your earnings are based on the 3 - step plan outlined in the prior page . if we receive a 100 % response rate , we can all earn $ 84 , 000 ! of course , a 100 % participation again , is unrealistic . members are reporting $ 35 , 000 - $ 60 , 000 within 2 months ( without the bonus plan ) . how do i join ? on the bottom of this page , write your name , address and product , as you want it to appear on this mailer . please print clearly . make 3 copies of the following information that includes 1 ) other participants , 2 ) your name , address and product and 3 ) the control number . wrap a $ 10 check , money order or cash inside of each copy and send one to each of the following people with a self-addressed , stamped envelope . keep the original for your tax records ; it is a legitimate business expense . do not cheat by sending out only one payment . only 1 of the 3 has the required information you will need to proceed . within days , you will receive your products , instructions and this mailer with your name listed as one of the three participants . you will then send out 20 of these mailers to others . within a week , you will begin to receive your money , and within 4 weeks you will have earned over $ 25 , 000 ! it s that easy ! join today ! 1 . j . dolbow 2089 waterbury se kentwood , mi 49508 ( sweetish no - names ) 2 . l . shock 7438 sawmill rd . # 458 columbus , oh 43235 ( amy s famous chicken ) 3 . s . butler po box 770074 coral springs , fl 33077-0074 ( delicious potato salad ) your name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city , state , zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your product _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ control number 187329 * your total cost for this program is $ 40 . 00 ( $ 30 . 00 to members , $ 3 printing , $ 7 stamps ) . there are no other fees . * canadian residents ask that you please remember to use 2 first class stamps when mailing to them . believe me , the extra stamps are worth it . they are some of our best participants ! * if paying by check , please allow 7 additional days to allow the check to clear . important information to ensure that you keep this legal and honest , be sure to file schedule c profit or loss from business with your income tax return . report all income you receive and deduct all business related expenses . these tax deductible business expenses can include vehicle ownership ( in your company s name ) , expenses , travel and entertainment , business equipment , purchases for your business , supplies , telephone , postage , advertising costs , rent , wages ( other than your own ) , legal and professional services , and business taxes . these can be legally deducted if they are related to your business .

( to get a list of all the internet access providers in your local = calling area goto : http : / / thelist . com and click on your area code . ) the floodgate users guide will teach you , step by step , how to download = the right files , how to strip the addresses , and finally , how to cut and = paste the formatted addresses into your marketing letter . or , if you = have an internet account , how to create distribution lists . one you ' ve = done this a few times you won't even have to think . it 's that simple ! for the brave & daring : pushing technology to its limits as you may know , the practice of sending unsolicited email is usually = frowned upon , and most service providers have rules against it . but , = like jay-walking , there is little enforcement . it 's not illegal . if = someone tells you that it is , ask them to provide the citation ( and = do n't let them give you some nonsense about faxes - that 's not email ) . = they can't do it because it 's not there . sometimes , when a lot of people = complain , i get a warning letter . and that 's about it . about 1 in 200 will write back and tell me , "" take me off the list "" , = which i can do , thanks to floodgates remove list feature . many people = reply back thanking me for sending them my informative letter . that 's = always nice . most people though , just reply and say , "" send me more = info . "" in this way , it usually takes me two or three letters to close a = sale . the floodgate users guide will provide you with proven formats for = writing a successful marketing letter . you ' ll test and rewrite , test and = rewrite . then , once you ' ve got it , just push a few buttons , and open the = floodgates ! ! ! the floodgate bulk email loader currently supports 17 + file formats 1 . compuserve classifieds : send your marketing letter to everyone who is = running a classified ad . i ' ll teach you how to download all the = classifieds from any single ad category . this is one of the most = responsive list of buyers . they check their email every day and they ' re = already in business . 2 . america on -

summary of multimodal refs,"summary to my query of early january : ) dear linguists , ) ) does anyone know of work - - studies , analyses - - in multimodal reference : ) i . e . how words and picture interact and refer to each other in texts ? ) thanks to all who responsed , among them : susan meredith burt , robert dale , karen emmorey , sharon flank , lisa frumkes , sabine geldof , james a . mcgilvray , georgia green , marti hearst , richard hirsch , sally jacoby , pirjo karvonen , john lee , dick oehrle , toshio ohori , laurent romary , deborah d k ruuskanen , roberta trites , mats wiren . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the background to my query is that my group has worked for some time with multimodal input to computer systems , using combinations of text and direct manipulation : point and click gestures . just recently we extended our scope somewhat , and we have just completed a first running version of a speech interface to a 3 - d graphic virtual environment . i myself am looking at reference resolution in the interface . we are currently in the process of experimenting and fooling about with it . i was surprised myself at the strong effects of visual focus and interactivity on referent choice in situations which could be construed as ambiguous , and conversely , how in certain constructions , the textual effects completely override visual and gestural cues . just recently we completed the first stage of the project . i will be happy to mail anyone a copy of our first tentative report on how things turned out . this led me on to a side track : i am currently working on a statistical study of a tintin album ( l ' oreille cassee ) to see how the pictorial mode of the text affects the structure of referential expressions . jussi karlgren , ivan bretan , niklas frost , lars jonsson . 1995 . ` ` interaction models for speech interfaces to virtual environments ' ' , proceedings of second eurographics workshop on virtual environments - - realism and real time , monte carlo . darmstadt : fraunhofer igd . integrating speech and virtual reality technology is being done simultaneously by several research groups , and there are several publications from various sources in the works . naturally , multimodality in the human computer interface can be more than speech , vision , and gestures , and a fair amount of work has been put into investigating effects of adding text input or output to graphical displays or vice versa . there are several studies made on multimodal aspects of human-human discourse , both spoken and in text form , some with an eye on application on human-computer interaction , and some not . several responses encouraged me to look more at studies of children 's literature : the standard reference to that appears to be nodelman , in the following list . the following list only contains the complete references i have been sent so far . they keep arriving , so i may post a revised version if i receive enough more material . naturally , the field is diverse and large , and this list does in no way even approximate the breadth and depth of study in the area , but much of the work in it is new to me . i hope it is of some use !

apocryphal american structuralist assertions,"there are two common , apocryphal assertions identified with american structuralist linguistics , and i am wondering if either of these assertions was actually made by an american structuralist . they are : 1 . language structures vary in infinitely many ways . this statement has been associated with boas , but it 's not in the hail intro . this statement has also been associated with martin joos , who supposedly said something along those lines attributing this view to boas ( but not necessarily endorsing it himself ) . 2 . the distributional method , applied rigorously , would yield a distinct syntactic category for every word in a language . it is possible that z s harris made such an assertion , though i have n't seen mention of it in the secondary literature . i am particularly interested in some form of these assertions made by structuralists who believed it themselves ; but if such do not exist , i am interested in attribution of these two beliefs to structuralists by others . thanks , bill croft

workshop announcement articulatory databases,"workshop on articulatory databases munich thursday 25th and friday 26th may , 1995 we are currently starting the preparations for a two-day workshop on articulatory databases . this will be the third in the series of workshops organized by the accor working group ( a consortium of phonetic institutes financed by the european community 's esprit programme ) and and follows the electromagnetic articulography meeting in munich ( april , 1992 ) , and the tongue modelling meeting in barcelona ( december 1993 ) . a few words on the aims of a meeting devoted to such an apparently dry topic : the basic premise is that the free availability of articulatory data could provide benefits in several partly overlapping areas : in basic research it could allow investigators to test hypotheses formulated in articulatory terms on a much wider range of data than the individual worker would normally be able to acquire or access unaided . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for deriving articulatory representations from acoustic data - relevant both for basic understanding of speech production as well as in potential applications such as speech displays for training the speech impaired . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for speech synthesis / recognition using an articulatory level of representation . the aim of the workshop would be to generate an exchange of ideas among people active in these areas in order to identify , for example ( further suggestions welcome ) : 1 ) what articulatory data is in existence that it would be beneficial to make more freely available ( archival / retrospective approach ) ? 2 ) what standards should freely available data meet ? - specification of recording conditions - anatomical frames of reference - levels of accuracy / reliability - linguistic specification of the speech samples - preferred data structures for distribution . - any other issues relevant to the data being used without risk of misinterpretation by people not actually involved in the the details of acquisition articulatory data can come in many guises depending on the speech subsystem tapped into and the transduction technique used . thus , it is possible to monitor position ( 1 , 2 or 3 dimensions ) , force , emg , airpressure / flow with techniques that may be static or dynamic , may involve imaging or point-tracking etc . etc . we think that people directly involved in acquisition can also benefit from considering how techniques can be standardized to promote maximum comparability of recordings made at different sites and with different hardware . 3 ) in analogy to acoustic databases ( where unlabelled data is of only the most limited use ) , what segmentation and labelling information ( and tools for the exploitation thereof ) could / should be made available with the raw data to facilitate flexible access for different purposes ? 4 ) for future recordings , what categories of data and corpora would be potentially of most widespread use ? if you are interested in participating please contact phil hoole ( preferably by email ) at the address below as soon as possible . further information on registration and format for presentations will be distributed early in 1995 . please also draw this letter to the attention of any colleagues you think might be interested . phil hoole and hans tillmann institut fuer phonetik munich university schellingstr . 3 d - 80799 munich germany fax : + 49 89 2800362 email : hoole @ sun1 . phonetik . uni-muenchen . de

"rules , innateness , psychological reality","guido vanden wyngaerd ( vol-3 - 395 ) claims that the wh-island constraint is innate . if it is innate , there is really nothing to explain . to vindicate his claim , wyngaerd purports to show that cognitive principles such as analogy make false predictions about how the structure of yes-no questions is acquired : if it were acquired by analogy , one would expect a more or less random distribution over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) : ( 1 ) a is [ the man who is tall ] _ _ in the room ? b * is [ the man who _ _ tall ] is in the room ? as the reason for this distributional expectation wyngaerd gives this : > given that the main source of evidence on yes-no questions at the child 's > disposal will overwhelmingly consist of simple sentences of the form "" is > the man _ _ in the room "" , the child could make the generalisation either > in way : in terms of linear precedence ( "" front the first finite verb "" , > yielding ( 1b ) ) or in terms of hierarchical structure ( "" front the finite verb > which follows the subject "" , yielding ( 1a ) ) . the fact that children do not > make mistakes in this respect ( ie do not form ( 1b ) ) clearly shows that > the rule is not one learned by experience , the relevant experience not > being rich enough to determine the nature of the rule and not being > able to explain the absence of mistakes . the above passage proves nothing . it would be interesting , indeed , to hear psycholinguists ' opinions about this kind of conjectural psycholinguistics . meanwhile , let me continue conjecturing , for the sake of argument . that "" the relevant experience [ is not ] rich enough to determine the nature of the rule "" echoes the well-known ' poverty of stimulus ' argument , which has never been proven . in the case at hand , it is easy to conjecture what sort of data / experience is relevant for a child to infer that yes-no questions are formed in terms of hierarchical structure . consider where-questions : where is [ x ] ? [ x ] is in z . is [ x ] in z ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - where is [ x who is y ] ? [ x who is y ] is in z . is [ x who is y ] in z ? in principle , analogy works here quite well : the where-question displays the hierarchy which can be analogically extended to other cases . but i am not concerned with whether or not analogy works in this particular case . what i am concerned with is , objecting to wholesale innatism . notice that this does not make me a _ tabula _ rasa _ proselyte . certainly children possess innate cognitive principles and abilities , but from this it does not follow that human beings are necessarily endowed with a grammar as a mental organ ; nor does it follow that the cognitive principles are linguistic or grammatical in nature . it should be clear from my earlier postings that i do not hold that "" children only produce what they hear "" . so , i concur with wyngaerd 's view that > children do not hear > forms like "" buyed "" , "" eated "" , or "" goed "" , yet they all go through a stage > where they produce these forms . this can only be because they make > generalizations ( rules , if you like ) , which go beyond what they hear . i expect wyngaerd to concur with me that forms like "" buyed "" , "" eated "" , or "" goed "" are due to analogy . > as far as the rest of nyman 's remarks is concerned , i still fail to > see how and why they motivate a distinction between grules and lrules : in his _ knowledge _ of _ grammar _ ( 1986 ) , chomsky speaks of rules as follws : "" it might be appropriate to describe the way a sheep dog collects the flock , or the way a spider spins a web , or the way a cockroach walks in terms of rule following , with reference to underlying "" competence "" consisting of rules of some sort . . . "" ( 239 ) . if you think this is analogical to linguistic behavior , you won't need recognize the conceptual distinction between social norms-of - language ( l - rules as objects of common knowledge ) and theoretical generalizations as formulated by a linguist ( g - rules ) . g ( rammatical ) rules need not be psychologically real , but if they are supposed to be psychologically valid , this means that g - rules are supposed to describe what the internalized rule must consist in ; no one knows how "" brain rules "" are represented ( mentalese ? ) . martti nyman department of linguistics , university of helsinki , finland

disc : the parameter of aspect,""" on the parameter of aspect "" this posting continues the fruitful exchange subsequent to the initial book review of c . smith 's 1991 "" the parameter of aspect "" . in a follow-up to that review , i noted an alternative to smith 's proposal involving a simpler binary parameter for aspect that was in part the basis for my 1995 dissertation on the biblical hebrew verbal system ( u of toronto ) . smith 's reply pointed out the apparent empirical disconfirmation by mandarin and navajo ( treated in her work among others ) ; and this is where we pick up the thread . i do not grant the traditional analysis of navajo and especially mandarin chinese that is the basis of the objection ; nor do i grant the traditional analysis of the "" oriental "" languages including burmese , japanese , and above all , biblical hebrew representing the classical semitic systems . the earliest layer of the quasi-consensus on tense , mood and aspect ( tma ) , flowing from comrie 1976 , 1985 to present , is the early 19th century "" orientalist "" framework that posits ( a ) "" tenseless "" languages or "" inflectional aspect "" systems , and ( b ) a definition of "" perfectivity "" based on the ambiguity inherent in the concept of "" completion "" ( global view as well as relative past tense ) ; on "" oriental "" and "" orientalism "" , see e . g . , e . said 's "" orientalism "" 1978 . i reject the orientalist framework and the analysis of semitic systems which was extended to other "" oriental "" systems , which was extended worldwide to at least half of the world 's systems ; i indirectly reject the traditional analysis of mandarin and navajo . to clarify and make the discussion more concrete , i offer an analysis of english in the orientalist framework ( * please * do not take this seriously as an analysis of english ) . english , as all reputable authorities agree , is "" tenseless "" : it encodes only "" aspect "" ( cf . slavic systems ) . not only do we find arrested development , but actual regression from the robust classical aryan tma systems . english has but one distinction : - ed vs - s / - 0 , respectively perfective and imperfective . the perfective signals "" completion "" vs the non-completion of the imperfective . the severely impoverished system of english signals the regression of the anglo - american mind ( witness reagan and thatcher , etc . , etc . ) . we note several key elements that underlie all traditional analyses of so-called "" tenseless "" languages . 1 ) tma is encoded morphologically on the greek model or not at all : the "" morphocentric fallacy . "" 2 ) the perfective is defined as relative past tense ( bypassing the revolution in aspectology in the second half of the 1800s ) : the "" aorist fallacy . "" 3 ) the relative hierarchy of languages , with greek and sanskrit on top , semitic near the bottom , and now the creoles on the bottom , related to the relative development of "" mind "" and tied to a particular pre - darwinian interpretation of evolutionary theory . english is not tenseless , nor is biblical hebrew or quranic arabic , nor is japanese , nor burmese , nor turkish , nor indeed mohawk or haitian creole . they do differ from the standard european systems : they systematically differ with respect to aspect in mirror-image fashion . this difference is insightfully captured by cowper 's strong claim for a simple binary parameter for aspect : a system default 's for an aspectual interpretation of its simple tense system , either perfective or non-perfective . the aspect not "" defaulted for "" is separately encoded ( cross-linguistically in a limited number of ways ) . european "" tense "" systems default for the non-perfective ( apparently the minority or marked option ) ; non - european "" tenseless "" systems default for the perfective as does english . i simply extrapolate to a strong claim for universal grammar : all systems encode tense ( past vs non-past ; i do not grant a "" future tense "" ) , and at least irrealis / realis ; and in addition the basic system is configured by the binary parameter for aspect . virtually all systems outside of the european sphere default for the perfective according to my studies ; and i assume that is the unmarked setting for ug . the major diagnostic among many is the ( non - ) obligatory expression of the progressive : the perfective default must separately encode the progressive . e . g . , mandarin must express the progressive by the zai v construction ( lit . "" at v "" ) : it defaults for the perfective . navajo and apparently the athabaskan family as a whole default for the non-perfective ( with algonquian systems , the only real pocket of european - like non-perfective defaulters ) . this work is summarized in my "" tenseless languages in light of an aspectual parameter for universal grammar : a preliminary cross - linguistic survey "" , forthcoming fall 1995 , toronto working papers in linguistics . this does not mean that individual lexica cannot increase the complexity of the system , nor that the many interactions between tma and lexical classes are not also parameterized . i ' m only talking about the basic configuration of the tma system for ug . smith is right to point to great complexity inherent in the systems she described in her last posting . re mandarin . the difficulty is what counts as "" inflection "" , and whether "" inflection "" is not infl of standard theorizing . i recognize mandarin - le as inflection ; but not - guo , - zhe ( smith does not mention v - ( yi - ) v , nor does she include v1-v2 compounds ) . the literature i use is divided on the morphosyntactic status of - guo . but - zhe , i think , does not in any way behave as "" inflection "" : see among many sources , li , thompson , "" the meaning and structure of complex sentences with - zhe in mandarin chinese "" jaos 96 . 4 ( 1976 ) . it certainly is not a "" progressive "" ; but is perhaps some sort of "" adjectivalization "" . re navajo . i think the jury is still out on these systems . but rice 's work on slave indicates the lexical nature of several classes of morphemes in the athabaskan verb complex . there is indeed a great deal of complexity here . and since athabaskan is really the only system that does not fall out naturally from my proposal , it deserves great attention . either the whole project falls through , or we learn something interesting about athabaskan systems , or the proposal gets modified in an interesting way : who knows . we learn nothing without strong claims . in summary : i reject any analysis that is "" tenseless "" ; and / or defines perfectivity in terms of relative past tense ( with comrie 1976 ) . these views embedded in the current consensus on tma can be easily traced to the early 1800s and the work on hebrew and arabic . i reject that early framework ( and the not-so - pretty cultural baggage that goes with it ) . in its place i place cowper 's binary aspectual parameter default , and extend the proposal not only to the other "" oriental "" systems but to a strong claim for ug 's tma system . according to my surveys , the only real problem is what to do with athabaskan systems : a project for the near future ( i hope ) . i note that many proposals under other approaches would benefit from the reduction and simplification of terms , concepts , etc . e . g . , bybee et al 's system can be streamlined ; and symmetries emerge that appear amenable to explanation . descriptive / typological work is put on a better footing as well . respectfully , vincent decaen c / o near eastern studies dept 4 bancroft ave . , 3d floor university of toronto toronto on m5s 1a1 canada or decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca

review of ostertag,"ostertag , gary ( ed ) ( 1998 ) definite descriptions : a reader , cambridge , ma : mit press , xii + 411pp , $ 30 . 00 . the collection begins with a substantive introductory essay by the editor . this is followed by fifteen papers , the majority of which were originally published in journals or in other anthologies , although some were originally chapters or parts of chapters of books . the collection ends with a useful bibliography , with readings arranged by topic . the first of the fifteen papers in ostertag 's anthology is russell 's 1905 paper ' on denoting ' , and the remaining papers are arranged in more or less chronological order , ending with a 1995 paper of stephen schiffer 's titled ' descriptions , indexicals , and belief reports : some dilemmas ( but not the ones you expect ) ' . the one deviation from the chronological sequence is stephen neale 's 1993 paper ' grammatical form , logical form , and incomplete symbols ' , which is placed in the sequence just after several papers authored or co-authored by russell . presumably the reason for placing neale 's paper out of chronological order is that it illuminates some of the more technical background notions whose grasp is essential to an understanding of the debate represented in the ensuing papers . neale discusses the distinction between grammatical and logical form , raises questions about the appropriate way to represent ordinary language quantifiers in semantic theory , discusses russell 's claim that definite descriptions are incomplete symbols , and discusses the implications of this for an attempt to give a compositional semantics for sentences containing descriptions . the other papers in the collection are the classic ones by strawson , donnellan and kripke , as well as more recently influential papers by such authors as peacocke , wettstein , soames and neale . ostertag regrets that he could n't have included more papers in his volume . he regrets for instance not including some of the work by marga reimer or by nathan salmon . ostertag compensates for this gap in a small way by spending some time in his introductory essay on reimer 's arguments against treating ' the f ' as a quantifier , and on salmon 's arguments against wettstein 's anti - russellian views . ostertag 's introductory chapter breaks the mold for this sort of essay , in the sense that it does n't contain a summary of the central arguments of the collected papers . possibly ostertag felt that since the majority of the papers in his collection are classics in the field , or at least frequently referred to by others in the field , it was unnecessary to encapsulate their central arguments in this way . presumably most instructors using this as a textbook in a philosophy of language course will be very familiar with the arguments contained in these papers . instead , ostertag 's essay presents a ( by his own admission partial ) view of some of the twists and turns the debate has taken . ostertag begins with a brief historical account of russell 's reasons for moving away from the extreme realist view which , under the influence of meinong , he had earlier accepted , to the position defended in ' on denoting ' . ostertag then lays out the treatment that russell gave to definite descriptions in principia mathematica , noting some of the contortions that russell had to go through to represent scope differences in his notation . ostertag ends this section by explaining the method of representing natural language quantifiers ( the method of restricted quantification ) that is favored by contemporary russellians , such as neale . this is followed by an interesting section in which ostertag argues that the contemporary significance of russell 's work is rather different from the significance it had when russell first published ' on denoting ' , partly due to the fact that russell 's treatment of descriptions as devices of quantification has been so readily incorporated into contemporary grammatical theory . ostertag turns next to a discussion of the referential / attributive distinction . ostertag 's conclusion is that referential uses of descriptions are adequately accounted for by a gricean strategy . that is , in cases in which a description is used referentially , we must distinguish what is meant from what is said . the referential understanding is retrieved via gricean mechanisms as an implicature from what is said . ostertag does n't explicitly discuss some of the neo - gricean and relevance theoretical alternatives that have appeared recently in the literature that challenge this gricean solution . however , ostertag 's footnotes do point readers to some of these alternative accounts . ostertag concludes with a discussion of the problem of incomplete descriptions ( e . g . descriptions such as ' the table is covered with books ' , which strawson first drew attention to ) , and with a discussion of various challenges by marga reimer and others to russell 's assimilation of descriptions to quantifiers . ostertag seems more pessimistic that russellians can deal adequately with these problems , and concludes his discussion with the claim that once we accept the context-sensitivity of descriptions , which it seems we must , then "" we are no longer in possession of an account of how the meaning of the quantifier phrase "" the f "" is determined by the meanings of its constituents . "" ( p . 28 ) . overall , ostertag 's essay is very interesting . however , there is one very small printing error , which leads to some difficulties in following the thread of ostertag 's argument . on p . 24 the references should be not to the sentences numbered ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , but to the sentences numbered ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . in his preface , ostertag remarks that it is somewhat surprising that no free standing collection of essays on descriptions has yet appeared . issues having to do with definite descriptions form one of the core topics in the philosophy of language and all the major textbooks in the philosophy of language contain a section devoted to these issues . free standing collections of essays on other topics central to the philosophy of language have appeared over the years . for instance , yourgrau ( 1990 ) and salmon & soames ( 1988 ) . so there does seem to be a need for a collection such as the present one , which could be useful for an upper level undergraduate or graduate seminar devoted to the topic of descriptions . the only philosophy of language textbook which comes close to having as much coverage of this topic is ludlow ( 1997 ) , which contains seven essays under the heading of definite and indefinite descriptions . the topic of indefinite descriptions is not addressed in ostertag 's collection , which is one of the disappointments about this volume , and is related to one of the major shortcomings of this volume . all the papers in ostertag 's collection are by philosophers . the classic philosophical debate has tended to focus on a narrow range of issues , with the alleged distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions being the dominant one . linguists who have worked on the topic of descriptions generally are interested in a much broader set of issues . some of the best current work by philosophers on descriptions ( such as that by stephen neale ) is cross-fertilized by the work of linguists . hence it would have been good to include work by linguists , not only to open up the philosophical discussion to a wider range of issues , but also to guard against the chance that students will come away with the impression that work on the topic by other professionals is of only marginal relevance to the philosophical debate . there is important recent work by linguists on the topic of the referential / attributive distinction ; on the comparison between definite and indefinite descriptions ; on the so-called generic , specific and predicative uses of descriptions ; on the claim ( found in work as early as strawson 's classic response to russell ) that the definite / indefinite distinction is related to the given / new distinction for information in a conversational context ; and on the semantics / pragmatics distinction as it applies to descriptions . some representative authors are : irene heim ( 1989 ) , ruth kempson , ( 1986 ) and villy rouchota , ( 1992 ) and ( 1994 ) . in addition , there is more technical work in linguistics which explores the extent to which definiteness is a semantic property of expressions , and hence the extent to which it is possible to offer a linguistically universal characterization of ( in ) definiteness . such work is represented in a recent collection of papers edited by eric reuland and alice ter meulen . see reuland & ter meulen ( 1987 ) . peter ludlow , in his preface to the philosophy of language textbook mentioned above , remarks that "" the philosophy of language , or at least a core part of it , has matured to the point where it is now being spun off into linguistic theory . "" ludlow , ( 1997 ) p . xiii . ludlow takes this to mean that certain core problems in philosophy of language are being "" naturalized "" via their incorporation into linguistics , and he uses this claim to justify the inclusion of the work of linguists in his collection , alongside the classics of the philosophy of language . i am not sure that i would go as far as ludlow in claiming that core parts of the philosophy of language are now a part of linguistics . but given that natural languages , as well as the speakers of such languages , are objects of study for the cognitive sciences , it makes sense for philosophers of language to pay attention to what other cognitive scientists are saying about such things . this means paying attention to linguistic research , but it also means paying attention to work on language by psychologists , anthropologists , computer scientists and others . to give just one example of where such cross-fertilization might occur : developmental psychologists have long been interested in how it is that children master the distinction between definite and indefinite referring expressions . see for instance karmiloff - smith ( 1979 ) and emslie & stevenson ( 1981 ) . charting the development of children 's semantic and pragmatic skills could potentially help clarify issues having to do with the correct semantic representation of ( in ) definites , as well as help in the resolution of questions concerning the boundary between the semantic and the pragmatic . this said , it should be stressed that as a text for use in a mainstream philosophy of language class , whose principle aim is to introduce students to the debate about definite descriptions as it has unfolded over the last 90 years , this volume is unsurpassed . the editor has clearly given a lot of thought to picking papers which are representative of this mainstream debate . it would be unreasonable to demand that all the tributaries , as well as the new offshoots , to this debate be represented in a single , manageably compact volume . perhaps the editor and / or his publishers will consider in the future bringing out a companion volume in which papers representing this wider debate are brought together ? bibliography : emslie , h . & stevenson , r .

computational linguistics / general and thematic sessions,"acl ' 99 call for papers 37th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics 20 - - 26 june , 1999 university of maryland [ you may find it easier to read this information on the web at http : / / www . mri . mq . edu . au / conf / acl99 ] 1 . paper sessions 1 . 1 topics of interest in a break with tradition , at this year 's acl conference we are experimenting with a new format . the technical sessions of the conference will be of two kinds . there will be general sessions of the kind that have formed the conference programme in the past ; however , there will also be a number of special thematic sessions , somewhat like a special issue of a journal , organised around themes proposed by members of the computational linguistics community . our aim is to incorporate some of the intensity and excitement of the traditional post-conference workshops , without replacing those workshops . the conference structure will mean that the thematic sessions will run as parallel sessions , resulting in smaller and more focussed audiences . when you submit a paper to the conference , you will need to consider whether you want to present the paper in the general sessions or in one of the thematic sessions , which are listed below . for the general sessions , papers are invited on substantial , original , and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics , including , but not limited to : pragmatics , discourse , semantics , syntax and the lexicon ; phonetics , phonology and morphology ; interpreting and generating spoken and written language ; linguistic , mathematical and psychological models of language ; language-oriented information retrieval and information extraction ; corpus-based language modeling ; machine translation and translation aids ; natural language interfaces and dialogue systems ; approaches to coordinating the linguistic with other modalities in multi-media systems ; message and narrative understanding systems . papers submitted to the thematic sessions are more narrowly targeted at specific topics . the complete list of thematic sessions is as follows ; further information about each can be found at the indicated url . d1 : dialogue management in interactive spoken dialogue systems chairs : diane litman and marilyn walker motivation : the advent of real-time interactive spoken dialogue systems poses special challenges for dialogue management . topics : evaluation , dialogue strategies , repair , system integration , learning / optimizing system behavior , corpus analysis , robust processing , and the requirements dialogue places on generation , speech recognition and synthesis . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ diane / acl99 - theme . html d2 : discourse tagging : uses , results and applications chairs : marilyn walker , julia hirschberg and owen rambow motivation : empirical approaches to discourse processing often rely on tagging texts or dialogues with discourse tags from a wide range of tag sets . topics : discourse tagging for training or testing models of discourse structure , reference , translation , speech acts , topic identification , and speech recognition . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ walker / dtag-acl 99 . html d3 : corpus - based approaches to discourse and dialogue chair : nancy ide this theme treats corpus-based work on any aspect of discourse and dialogue analysis , including co-reference , segmentation , discourse structure , parsing , generation , etc . , especially in the light of relevance to practical applications . http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / calls / acl99 - discourse . html d4 : lexicon and discourse : connections through structure and semantics chairs : laurence danlos , alistair knott , and bonnie webber motivation : with the lexicon becoming a central resource for computing properties of the sentence , one may consider similar gains for computing properties of discourse . topics : lexical semantics of discourse connectives and focus particles , discourse and lexical interpretation , lexicalized grammars for discourse . http : / / www . cogsci . ed . ac . uk / ~ alik / acltheme . html i1 : nlp techniques for cross - language information retrieval chair : douglas oard motivation : systems that use queries or examples in one natural language to find text or speech in another are becoming increasingly important . topics : nlp techniques for query translation , cognate matching and interlingual matching techniques , cross-language gisting using summarization or gloss translation . http : / / www . clis . umd . edu / conferences / acl99clir / i2 : exploring the limits of shallow parsing chair : gregory grefenstette shallow parsing techniques provide a partial analysis of the syntactic structures . theme covers research into : quantifying identifiable linguistic phenomena in a corpus ;

""" sycopahnt "" and "" sign of the fig ""","the responses to my recent enquiry about the word "" sycophant "" and the "" sign of the fig "" were very interesting and varied . in view of this , instead of summarizing the responses i am forwarding them with minor editing : figs were first introduced in greece as expensive ( and therefore prestigious status symbols ) so that to own a fig tree was a big deal and waiting for the tree to come to fruit-bearing age and pick the fruit itself an even bigger deal . security was often low ( no electric street lights ) and so often non fig owners indulged in stealing figs ( it was probably a daredevil act too ) . so , it was decreed that anyone caught stealing figs was a crime and rewards were given to those who revealed ( phanein ) the fig ( syko ) thieves . of course , since the pilferers were probably less happy about being finked on than the fig owners , the term ' fig revealer / shower ' took on very negative connotation . it 's one thing to be steal badly and get caught ( 'd eservedly ' for botching up ) but quite another to be told on : and so goes on the lore about how sycophant came to be ( still used in modern greek , as it is in english ) but i cannot swear on its authenticity . at least that 's what we were taught in primary ( athens ) . jenny dalalakis , mcgill university , linguistics , e-mail bgbi @ musicb . mcgill . ca * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the sign of the fig is a highly insulting hand gesture used , so far as i know , in italy ( perhaps in other places , too . ) it is made by making a fist , with the thumb inserted between the index and middle fingers . the gesture represents th e female genitalia . a photograph of someone making the sign of the fig appears in the book gestures , a book of some ten to fifteen years ago illustrating and explaining various gestures , not just insulting ones , from a number of cul - tures . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in dante 's inferno , the sign of the fig is a sign of disrespect , in this case aimed at god ( presumably because of the forbidden apple / fig thing . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * . . . by the sign of the fig you mean a gesture , quite common in many european cultures , where you put your thumb between the first 2 fingers . originally this was symbol for sexual intercourse and therefore an obscene sign . ( "" fig "" is one of the euphemisms for the female genital . ) i know from a viennese dialect dictionary that the sign used to be current hereabouts , but it is not widely used now , whereas in italy and esp . in russia ( as to greece , i forget ) it is very current now . in russian it has lost its original obscene meaning and means simply something like "" not at all "" or "" you are pretending to work while you are not "" or "" the hell you do "" . though not indecent . . still indecent . according to barbara monahan , ( a dictionary of russian gestures ) , "" this is one of the most widely used gestures in the soviet union . . . . it is not at all indecent or vulgar . it is really the nonverbal equivalent of a very strong "" no "" . ( p . 86 ) ( among adults it can be insulting . ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the etymology of sycophant is sukon ' fig ' and phainen ' to show ' . the story is that at one time it was supposedly against the law to export figs from athens and sukophantes often turned in violators of the unpopular law for their own personal gain , these toadies being widely despised . in a word , sycophants were originally informers on fig exporters . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the sign of the fig , also known by its latin name , "" manus ficus "" , was and apparently still is a mediterranean equivalent of the north american "" giving the finger "" insult . it is formed by placing the thumb between the index and middle fingers of the closed , fist . interestingly , in the american manual alphabet , it is the handshape representing the letter "" t "" , but is avoided in the manual alphabets of many countries and replaced by other similar but less offensive handshapes . according to _ the hand book _ ( linda lee and james charlton , prentice - hall , 1980 ) , "" the / fica / or fig sign is an ancient copulatory gesture . here the thumb is thrust between the forefinger and the middle finger of the same hand , simulating the penis thrust through a woman 's labia . ( . . . ) it is called the / fica / or fig because the inserted thumb is about the size and shape of the fig , which , being an ancient symbol of abundance , carried with it a sense of virility and fecundity to the / mano in fica / . ( . . . ) "" ( page 70 ) . i do n't know anything about the semantic evolution of the word , but informally , i can see how the present meaning of sycophant would apply to the kind of person who would hang around on the sidelines of the action at a trial , making rude gestures at an accused , deriving the right to do so by associating him / herself with the people in power who were judging the case . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i seem to vaguely remember from my high school days that a sycophant was someone who kept an eye on the fig trees to make sure that no one stole the fruit . now , when someone was taken to court , because allegedly they had stolen figs , the sycophant would provide evidence against them by pushing aside the fig leaves and showing that some figs had been removed ! unfortunately , i cannot remember why it was a crime to cut the fruit of the fig trees ! were they intended to be offered to gods ? that could be a possible reason why they were so precious . i cann ' t remember really . . . incidentally , sycophantis in modern greek means the ' one who presents in court or in public unfounded accusations against someone ' . this probably relates to the fear of ancient athenians that someone might ' throw ' at them accusations that they would n't have been able to cope with , since a sycophant 's testimony was not to be questioned in any way . phantis in greek is an agent ; it does not mean the sign , but the person who presents something or makes something known . for example , ierophantis means someone who unravels the sacred signs of gods , i . e . a seer or prophet . modern greek has got both a verb sycopha ' nto and an abstract noun sycopha ' ntia . one last bit of ethnographic detail : it is or at least used to be common practice in greece to cut figs from trees without considering issues of who the tree / farm belongs to ! it is believed that fig trees just grow on their own without any special care and therefore do not belong to anybody . thanks for the opportunity to switch back to my mother tongue for a while ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * sykophantes ist ein verbales rektionskompositum aus "" phaino : to sukon "" ( to point at the figs ) , das zum erstenmal bei aristophanes acharner 559 ( 425 v . chr . ) auftritt . sein urspruenglicher sinn ist schon in der antike umstritten , vgl . lidell - scott , s . v . : sykophantes ist ein verbales rektionskompositum aus "" phaino : to su : kon "" ( to point at the figs ) , das zum erstenmal bei aristophanes , ach . 559 ( 425 v . chr . ) auftritt . sein urspruenglicher sinn ist schon in der antike umstritten , vgl . lidell - scott , s . v . : "" orig . used of denouncers of the attempted export of figs from athens acc . to . . . plu . solon 24 , 2 . 523b ; . . . of citizens entrusted with the collection of figs as a part of public revenues etc . . . . these and modern explanations are mere guesses .

- but how can we perceive those regularities ? - and how do we reason on the basis of that knowledge if there are no observable constraints on infererring ? - but if there are , where do they come from and how are they actually implemented mentally ? - and finally : how do we come to act rationally , that is , in accordance with what we have perceived , processed and inferred . we are interested in all ways of defining rules and in all aspects of rule following , from the definition of law , rule , regularity , similarity and analogy to logical consequence , argumentational and other inferences , statistical and linguistic rules , practical and strategic reasoning , pragmatic and praxeological activities . we expect contribution from the following research fields : game-theory , action theory , argumentation theory , cognitive science , linguistics , philosophy of language , epistemology , pragmatics , psychology and semiotics . we would be happy to include some contributions from natural sciences such as neuro-biology , physiology or brain sciences . the conference is organized in three major sections : philosophy , psychology and linguistics with six keynote lectures . then contributions of 30 minutes ( 20 for paper and 10 for discussion ) will follow . we also plan to organize a workshop at the end of each section abstracts : abstracts should be one-page ( maximum 23 lines ) specifying area of contribution and the particular aspect of rule-following to be addressed . abstracts should be sent by e-mail to : tarnay @ btk . jpte . hu or bocz @ btk . jpte . hu . hard copies of abstracts may be sent to : laszlo tarnay department of philosophy janus pannonius university , ifjusag utja 6 , h-7624 pecs , hungary important dates : deadline for submission : march 15 , 1998 notification of acceptance : march 25 , 1998 conference : april 30 - may 1 - 2 , 1998 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * for those concerned there is a follow-up philosophical colloquium : john mcdowell : mind and world - kant in analytic philosophy which discusses mcdowell 's recent book : mind and world . among would-be participants are barry allen , michael williams and robert brandon . if interested , contact prof . janos boros , dept . of philosophy , janus pannonius university . e-mail : boros @ btk . jpte . hu

- - - - - - - - the prolamat conference is an internationally well known event for demonstrating and evaluating activities and progress in the field of discrete manufacturing . sponsored by the international federation for information processing ( ifip ) , the prolamat is traditionally held every three years and it includes the whole area of advanced software technology for design and manufacturing in discrete manufacturing . past conferences have explored : - manufacturing technology , - advances in cad / cam , - software for discrete manufacturing , - software for manufacturing . the eight international prolamat focused on the theme of man in cim . the 1995 prolamat featured the theme of life cycle modelling for innovative products and processes . the 1998 conference in italy will be organized by the university of trento , school of engineeering and department of computer and managemet sciences , jointly with istituto trentino di cultura , under the auspices of the wg2 for "" computer - aided design "" and wg3 for "" computer - aided manufacturing "" of the technical committee 5 for "" computer applications in technology "" . this conference will be the last prolamat before the next century , and it provides an opportunity to investigate and imagine what the digital communications revolution going on all around us will mean for manufacturing . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conference subjects -

- - - - - - representations , reuse people , not machines , design new products and make manufacturing systems work . increasingly , groups of people are required to design new products and bring them to market . requirements for agility and the suitability of specific manufacturing processes must be matched with the culture and knowledge base of the work force . world - class processes have floundered when this was not done . information and communication systems can either amplify or reduce the magnitude of differences across culture or engineering discipline . researchers specializing in knowledge representation , modelling , communications , standardization , and reuse will be invited to share their experiences and research perspectives . - enterprise data sharing across engineering , cultural , and supply chain boundaries , - distributed manufacturing and supply chain management - early stage product development which dynamically incorporates supplier constraints - standard models for component information representation , product and process interchange , - technologies for knowledge sharing , collaboration , and across the product lifecycle , - adaptive systems for organizational management , knowledge sharing , education , and training - organizational and manufacturing process simulation - organizing and representing design and manufacturing process for dissemination and reuse - the interface between human and machine for information sharing , training , education , -

"re : 6 . 775 , syldavian tutorial","there is one ( at least ) translation of the oldest syldavian text , which our first tutorial ommitted . ihave waited to long to refer interested readers to my sources , but it is an inevitable work for those interested as much in syldavian as in bordurian . it comes from frederic soumois ' dossier tintin : sources , versions , themes , structures , jacques antoine , 1987 . it shows how much herge used brussels french and flemish roots in every language he "" devised "" in his works . for example , pace guy who adopted herge 's own suggestion of translation of "" eih bennek , eih blavek "" by "" qui s ' y frotte s ' y pique "" ( roughly , "" whoever rubs himself against it will get stung by it "" ) , it looks more like dutch "" hier ben ik , hier blijf ik "" , meaning "" here i am , here i stay "" . the translation soumois proposes for the xivth century manuscript goes approximately like this ( i won't bother to go into the etymological details , and i won [ t try to reproduce the original text : "" father ottokar , thou art then king of [ the city / poland ? ] , then the trone is for me "" . that one says to the other : "" come get the sceptre "" . and the king stroke staszrvich with the sceptre , and the nanny-goat [ ? ] fell on the floor / was left on the field . "" i also recommend , as an example of l2 morphology , the excellent passage in borduria that one can find in the french version of "" the calculus affair "" ( l ' affaire tournesol ) , unfortunately absent in the english version , and hopefully to be found again in the german version , if i can get it ( and probably not in the chinese version ) . there are also short passages of linguistic interest in destination moon and explorers on the moon , and , for arumbaya , in tintin and the broken ear . any useful or absolutely useless information welcome . richard desrochers

info,"dear ion , i am very happy to have found you . i had no idea so many people also = share this interest in figurative language . i find this very exciting = because it 's the language i work in . the operational language of = computers is binary . the operational language of the human mind is = pictures . i use psychotherapy called metaphor therapy that takes all = figurative statements and treats them literally . if you take an = interest in figurative speech , i thought you might like to know more = about this . it 's an approach that looks for the figures in figurative = speech and uses them to heal or dissolve persistent uncomfortable = feelings . the figures of speech that salt out language reflect the inner figures = of the subconscious mind . so , for example , if someone says there 's a = cloud over his or her head , in the subconscious mind there is a cloud . = the cloud feels real internally because the subconscious mind accepts = what it sees as real ( that 's why dreams appear real when the conscious = mind is turned off during sleep ) . = 20 this is important because it 's the key to the inner mind . treating the = figures ( pictures ) as real opens up the subconscious mind because it = accepted the images as real to begin with . these figures and images = reflect our inner world and bring fascinating information to the = surface . working within the realm of a person 's own symbolic = representation of their problem or issue facilitates profound change . = using words that go to the core of our thinking and feelings helps to = change behavior , decisions and choices . = 20 there is a strong connection between figurative language and healing . = that understanding has produced a new verbal technology for entering the = control center of the mind and healing the psyche . it uses the figures = in language to go to the root of the psyche , where thoughts , feelings = and decisions originate . affecting change from this vantagepoint = produces greater satisfaction in personal life and professional = performance . productivity is , above all , a state of mind ; so we can never = underestimate the power of the mind in affecting all realms of health = and happiness . to best gain an improved control of life , we go to the = control center where thoughts and feelings begin . thoughts and feelings = come to conscious awareness without any effort on our part and they come = directly from the conscious mind . the language of the subconscious is = neither english nor japanese , but pictures and images . metaphor therapy is a unique , innovate approach that speaks the same = operational language as the inner mind . the subconscious mind is not = only the very foundation of our ego , thinking and emotions ; it is also = where most depression , anxiety , eating and compulsive disorders , = phobias , obsessive thoughts , urges and unwanted behavior originate . = while this was already known , what 's new is the understanding that = behind each of these symptoms are persistent uncomfortable feelings . what is also new is the ability to speak a therapeutic picture-language = that goes to the inner mind where obstacles begin , and use these = uncomfortable feelings as a trail that leads to the root of almost any = problem . change occurring at the root is always more dynamic than = change at the surface and leads to outward changes , as well . inner = healing promotes outward change , more control and a stronger mind . going directly into the control center of the mind has an added benefit = of recapturing the wholeness and innate strength we were born with . it = is natural that in the course of growing up we lose parts of self as we = adjust to the demands of the world . as children , we may be subject to = abuse , neglect or trauma . our spirit may be broken or bruised along the = way , but we conform and put our feelings aside . as adults , if we ' re = caught in a life threatening situation where death appears imminent , it = takes even more out of us if the ego dissociates just prior to the = event . shutting down as a way of avoiding the event or the feelings = that go with it , the ego goes somewhere else as a way of not letting it = happen . when qualities and characteristics of self are lost , it leaves = a vague , lingering feeling that something is missing . recovering the missing fragments of self and restoring them is not = esoteric nonsense . it is a concrete discipline based on recent = advancements that permit direct access to our inner mind . speaking the = language of the inner mind affords the best opportunity for healing to = occur . restoration of self dissolves a great many negative feelings , and = makes the mind clearer and the will stronger . metaphor therapy = unleashes the strong , innate power within by using the mind 's ability to heal itself , and creates a base of = self-confidence that is genuine and lasting . = 20 i want to get the word out about metaphor therapy . since this may be = some real hope for some people , please share this letter with others . = as for my part , i would be happy to give you any specific information = about the approach or answer any questions you may have . also , if you 'd = like some examples of healings that were accomplished with the use of = figurative language , please let me know . my best , = 20 = 20 drs www . angelfire . com / ak / drsiegel

16 - m clean e - mail addresses,"16 million clean e - mail addresses we took a total of over 92 million e-mail addresses from many of the touted cd 's that are out there ( bought them all - some were $ 300 + ) ! we added the millions we had in storage to those . when we combined them all , we had in excess of 100 + million addresses in one huge file . we then ran a super "" sort / de-dupe "" program against this huge list . it cut the file down to less than 25 million ! ! can you believe that ! ? it seems that most people that are selling cd 's are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many "" program generated "" e-mail addresses like compuserve , mci , anon 's , etc . . . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash . etc . . . we then ran a program that contained 150 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . . . also we eliminated all . edu , . mil . , org . , gov . , etc . . . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 16 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and a lot less time ! we also purchased cyber promo 's ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 million that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber 's e-mail addresses from top to bottom . we did not clean these , but we did create 3 separate files named cyber1 . txt , cyber2 . txt , and cyber3 . txt of 100 , 000 addresses each . this will give all people that use the list an opportunity to send mail to the list before deciding if their cd is all it 's hyped up to be . we also included a 2 + million "" remove / flamer "" file broke into separate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes . "" you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best . here 's what you get when you order today : * 16 million e - mail addresses * one line in simple text format * all on cd-rom * files are in lots of 100 , 000 ( no codes to open files ) * all files are separated by domain name for your convenience ! * plus you receive a tremendous remove list ! * plus a sampling of cyberpromo 's hot list now only $ 149 . 00 ! this price is effective for the next seven days , thereafter the price will be $ 199 . 00 so order now ! all lists are completely free of any duplicates . we also on a continual basis , add new names and remove undeliverables and remove requests . the result is the cleanest e - mail addresses available anywhere to use over and over again . all for a fraction of the cost that other companies charge . typical rates for acquiring e-mail lists are from "" information highway "" robbery ! do n't even hesitate on this one or you will miss out on the most effective way to market anywhere . . . period ! http : / / www . gaura . com / software / sys . htm http : / / www . gaura . com / software to order : to order , simple print out the ez order form below and fax it to our office today . we accept visa or mastercard . or checks by fax fax completed form to : ( 425 ) 379-9722 _ _ _ _ _ e - mail pro . . . . . $ 350 . 00 _ _ _ _ stealth mass mailer . . . $ 395 . 00 _ _ _ _ 16 million clean e - mail addresses on cd-rom . . . . $ 149 . 00 _ _ _ _ check deposit system . . . . . $ 99 . 00 _ _ _ _ submit spider standard version . . . . $ 49 . 95 _ _ _ _ submit spider professional version . . . . $ 99 . 90 _ _ _ _ send software on cd-rom . . . . $ 10 . 00 name : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ country : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ country code or zip code : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ phone : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ fax : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ e - mail : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ type of credit card : _ _ _ _ visa _ _ _ _ mastercard account number : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ expiration date : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ name on card : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total amount : $ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i understand that all sales are final . signature : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ date : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ check by fax : if you would like to fax a check , paste your check below and fax it to ( 425 ) 379-9722 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * please paste your check here and fax it to us at : ( 425 ) 379-9722 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * if you fax a check , there is no need for you to send the original check . we will draft up a new check , with the exact information from your original check . all checks will be held for bank clearance .

kornfilt : turkish,"jaklin kornfilt ( 1997 ) , turkish . london and new york : routledge . xxxi + 575 pp . 110 , us $ 180 . reviewed by steve seegmiller , montclair state university . jaklin kornfilt 's grammar of turkish ( hereafter referred to as turkish ) is the first new , comprehensive grammar of this language to be published in english in more than two decades . as such , its appearance is a significant event , especially since its author is a well known and respected authority on turkish . this is the latest title in the descriptive grammars series , edited by bernard comrie and published by routledge . the goals of the works in this series are different from those of most grammars : the descriptive grammars are intended for linguists rather than general users . all of the grammars in the series address the same issues in a uniform format so that a given feature may be easily compared across languages , and they contain information of a sort that is often absent from more traditional grammars . toward the end of the review i will comment briefly on the potential utility of this grammar for non-linguists , but for the most part i will focus on usefulness of the grammar for linguists . the descriptive grammars series now includes nearly 30 titles . according to the editorial preface , the series gives preference to languages for which comprehensive descriptions are not presently available ( iv ) . the aim of the series is to provide information to linguists who are interested in language typology , language universals , and comparative grammar , employing a terminology and a notation that will make the information accessible to linguists regardless of their particular specialization or orientation . authors of the grammars in the series are expected to organize their descriptions as answers to a series of questions ( originally published in lingua vol . 42 , no . 1 , 1977 ) . turkish contains over 600 pages , including the prefatory material , the table of contents , and the bibliography . the grammatical description alone amounts to just over 550 pages . it is thus roughly twice as long as lewis ( 1967 ) and about 100 pages longer than underhill ( 1976 ) . the book contains five chapters of widely varying lengths . chapter 1 ( syntax ) contains 211 pages , chapter 2 ( morphology ) 270 pages , chapter 3 ( phonology ) 32 pages , chapter 4 ideophones and interjections ) just 3 pages , and chapter 5 ( lexicon ) 16 pages . thus approximately 90 per cent of the book is devoted to morphology and syntax . furthermore , a good deal of the information in the morphology chapter deals with syntactic matters , giving the book an especially heavy bias toward syntax . . this distribution of information no doubt reflects both the interests of the author and the current emphasis of typological research . the chapters on phonology and the lexicon are both very well done and very useful ( more on this below ) , but they do not address all of the issues that might be of interest to a phonologist or a lexical semanticist . a notable feature of the book is the extensive and detailed table of contents . it is eleven pages long and , used in conjunction with the fourteen-page index , provides easy access to the an extensive body of information about turkish . how well does turkish accomplish its goals ? i think it handles syntax and morphology marvelously well , phonology and the lexicon adequately , and ideophones and interjections in a cursory fashion . the chapters on syntax and morphology provide the best , most detailed descriptions of these parts of the language available . the analyses are up to date and insightful , and kornfilt has done a superb job of bringing clarity to some of the most difficult parts of the language . in concept and terminology , the description straddles the line between generative and traditional or non-generative approaches . for instance , kornfilt uses the terms ' possessive adjective ' ( 105 ) and 'd emonstrative adjective ( 106 ) rather than the more usual ' possessive ' and 'd emonstrative . ' similarly , the descriptions are stated in terms of surface phenomena and grammatical constructions and not in any recognizable theoretical framework . this is probably the right choice , given the diverse backgrounds of the probable users of the grammar . the range of coverage is broad and thorough . kornfilt deals with sentence types , both simple and complex ; with negation and questions ; with grammatical categories and phrase types ; and with most of the other grammatical phenomena that might interest linguists . the morphology chapter contains information not just on inflection and derivation , but also on the uses of the various morphological forms . cross - referencing is extensive , making it easy for the reader to find all of the relevant information on a topic even if it is not found in the same section of the book . this approach of interrelating syntax and morphology is very useful and allows kornfilt to clarify some of the cloudy areas of turkish grammar . perhaps most notable are her treatments of the participial and nominal systems and their relation to subordination ( pp . 323-413 and at various places in chapter 1 ) . finite subordination is rare in turkish . a far more frequent pattern of subordination involves the use of a participial or nominalized verbal stem . the complexity of the system is mind-boggling to students of the language , but kornfilt 's description makes it coherent and intelligible . her treatment of other aspects of turkish morphology and syntax are equally well done . a very useful feature of turkish is the inclusion of information about what does * not * occur in the language . this is often essential information for linguists ( whether studying typology , syntax , or morphology ) and is rarely included in more traditional grammars . thus we find on page 104 the statement that postpostitions govern only one case ( with the lone exception of ' kadar ' ) . in lewis ( 1967 ) , this information can be inferred from the discussion of cases on pages 85-95 , but it is not so easy to find and not so categorically stated . there are many similar examples , especially in the syntax chapter . the chapter on phonology is short , clear , and precise , but it does not contain the amount of detail found in the syntax and morphology chapters . while the information presented will be adequate for many purposes , phonologists will no doubt wish for more elaborate discussions of issues like vowel harmony , stress assignment , and phonological ( or morphophonemic ) alternations . i found one omission in this chapter . on page 491 , the final devoicing rule is described as applying to syllable-final plosives and affricates , yet on page 487 there are examples of final devoicing of liquids as well , described as being standard but not universal . a cross-reference would have been useful here . for the most part , transcriptions in the phonology chapter follow the ipa norms . one exception , though , is the transcription of palatalized consonants by means of a comma rather than a raised j . ' while this may have been done for typographical reasons , it might confuse a casual user . chapter 4 , ideophones and interjections , is only 3 pages long and provides only the briefest commentary on these phenomena . while many linguists ( myself included ) will not mind the short shrift given to these topics , some will no doubt be disappointed that the list of ideophones occupies less than a page and a half . chapter 5 , lexicon , is a short but interesting sample of the lexicon of turkish . the chapter contains lists of words organized by semantic field . these include kinship terminology , color terms , body parts , and cooking terminology . also included is a list of just over 200 items of "" basic vocabulary , "" which seems to correspond to the so-called swadesh list . linguists interested in historical linguistics and language classification will be grateful to find this set of words conveniently collected together . setting aside some minor qualifications , as a reference work on turkish for linguists , turkish has no equal . it is more comprehensive , more up to date , and more effectively organized than any other description of the language . the method of organization , as well as the detailed table of contents and the index , make a wealth of information available almost instantaneously . it is , simply put , an admirable reference work on turkish for linguists . the same can not be said about the utility of turkish for non-linguists . there are two main reasons why the book will not be accessible to non-linguistic audiences . first , kornfilt assumes familiarity with linguistic terminology . in the very first paragraph on page 1 , for example , she uses the terms ' nominalized clause ' and ' constituent clause , ' neither of which is likely to be familiar to non-linguists . second , turkish presupposes an interest in and a knowledge of certain linguistic questions . kornfilt has little to say , for example , about questions of stylistic variation , formal versus colloquial speech , or any of a range of topics that the typical student or scholar of turkish might be interested in . this is not really a criticism , since the descriptive grammar series has a well defined audience that excludes non-linguists . nevertheless , it is unfortunate that the grammar will not be useful to a wider audience . it will supplement but will not replace lewis ( 1976 ) and underhill ( 1976 ) . i have just two complaints about turkish . first , there is a relatively large number of errors and inconsistencies . most are minor and consist of missing ' - s 's on verbs , using ' of ' for ' or , ' etc . , but some will cause confusion . on page 27 , for example , turkish is described as a 's ubject-verb - object language . ' ( it is actually s - o - v . ) a sentence on page 30 , which addresses the of question whether pied-piping of postpositions is obligatory , leaves the reader unsure of the answer . there are also some contradictions . on page 142 , the claim is made that the reflexive can never occur in subject position , but on page 305 we learn that the reflexive can occur as an honorific subject and on page 542 three references are given to works that discuss reflexive subjects in subordinate clauses . other inconsistencies are found in the bibliography , where some turkish titles are translated into english and others are not . the author is aware of some of the errors and has prepared an addendum which contains a short list of errata , but many of the errors that i found are not included . the addendum is available free of charge from the author or the publisher . my other complaint concerns the cost of turkish . at us $ 180 , the grammar is unlikely to find its way into many private libraries . this is unfortunate ; since the book is so useful , linguists interested in turkish will want to have it close at hand . references lewis , g . l .

logic and natural language semantics,"esslli-99 workshop : foundations of intensional logic and natural language semantics call for papers the main focus of the european summer schools in logic , language and information is the interface between linguistics , logic and computation . it is organized under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . foundational , introductory and advanced courses together with workshops cover a wide variety of topics within six areas of interest : logic , computation , language , logic and computation , computation and language , language and logic . previous summer schools have been highly successful , attracting around 500 students from europe and elsewhere . the school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . esslli-99 will take place at the university of utrecht , the netherlands , august 9-20 . in its first week it will feature a worskshop on foundations of intensional logic and natural language semantics . its aim is to provide a forum for advanced ph . d . students and other researchers to present and discuss their work on the following issues . intensional logic lies at the heart of a montague - style natural language semantics . it involves a representation of properties , relations and propositions ( prps ) . in traditional montague grammar , prps are characterized in terms of possible worlds , and the logico-semantic paradoxes are avoided by using a russellian hierarchy of types . the problems with this traditional approach ( e . g . , logical omniscience and expressive limitations ) have led to the flourishing of more fine - grained notions of prp , and to type-free solutions to the paradoxes ( gupta and belnap , barwise and etchemendy , cocchiarella , bealer , asher and kamp , chierchia and turner , etc . ) . the new approaches have problems of their own and no new framework has become standard . this workshop thus will explore and compare well - known or newly proposed foundational approaches for an intensional logic that can serve the purposes of natural language semantics . if you are interested in presenting your research , please send a two page abstract to : francesco orilia orilia @ unimc . it dipartimento di filosofia e scienze umane ph . + 39 ( 0733 ) 258 305 universit = e0 di macerata fax + 39 ( 0733 ) 235 339 62100 macerata italy the submission deadline is : march 15 , 1999 . workshop speakers will pay a reduced essli-99 registration fee , which will entitle them to attend all other courses and workshops . it may be possible to allocate a sum of about 100 ecu to partially cover the expenses of each workshop speaker . there will soon be an esslli ' 99 web page at : http : / / esslli . let . uu . nl / .

sociolinguistics,"mediated discourse as social interaction : a study of news discourse ron scollon , professor in the department of english , city university of hong kong . paper 0 582 32725 3 hardback 0 582 32726 1 336 pages 1998 language in social life series ' mediated discourse as social interaction ' makes an explicit link between media studies and social interactionalist discursive research where previously the two fields of study have been treated as separate disciplines . this text presents an integrated theory illustrated by ample concrete examples , bringing together the latest research in these two fields . it offers a critique to the sender-receiver model implicit in media studies , and argues for an analysis of media discourse as social interaction , on the one hand among journalists and newsmakers as a community of practice , and among readers and viewers as a spectating community of practice on the other . the book also argues for a coherent and interdiscursive methodology for the ethnographic study of the role of the news media in the social construction of identity and is based on a considerable body of ethnographic and textual analysis of both print and television news media . the theory of mediated discourse presented in this volume will be of great interest to advanced undergraduates and postgraduates studying media studies , sociology of language , discourse analysis , interactional sociolinguistics , ethnography of communication and applied linguistics . it will also be welcomed by scholars and professionals involved in research in these areas . further information on the books published in this series , and the table of contents for this title can be viewed at the longman linguistics on-line catalogue at : http : / / www . awl-he . com / linguistics for a complete listing of our world-wide offices , please click below : http : / / www . awl-he . com / offices

improvements in wound care !,"hello , my name is kevin elphick and i am the managing director of nursing innovations which have been manufacturing and supplying a range of innovative wound dressing protectors named ' keep - dri dressings ' to australian hospitals for a period in excess of 8 years . these internationally award winning products are now extensively used in over 70 % of western australian hospitals ( references available upon request ) and we are now looking at supplying to hospitals internationally . however , we have found from experience it is difficult to initially introduce the product to hospitals . once a hospital starts using keep - dri dressings they have always continued to use them . our success is related to the fact that they are quick and easy to apply ( saving staff time ) and they really work . the result is lower infection risk , reduced patient trauma and lower cost for the hospital . for your free sample contact me at my web site http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone here you will find a full product description , uses and advantages and a link to my email address . i would appreciate any suggestions you might have to help introduce this excellent product into hospitals in your area or comments you have on our product . many thanks in advance . kevin elphick nursing innovations 23 yulema street mullaloo , perth , western australia 6027 618-9487 - 1807 http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * k

sum : ' because ' versus 's ince / as ' ( 6 . 1043 ),"i would like to thank the following persons very much for their judgements , comments and various hints concerning my query : marie egan , duncan macgregor , richard ingham , james kirchner , kevin lemoine , david powers , karen ward , yael ziv and especially karen stanley , who took a poll about my claims among her colleagues ( a big thank-you to them too ) . > from the mail i have received by now , the following picture emerges : including the people interviewed by k . stanley , 7 do not agree with my distinction and 5 do agree more or less . some informants suggest other distinctions between the conjunctions : for one , 's ince ' and ' as ' are more formal than ' because ' ( a view which is also presented in some dictionaries and grammars ) , for another , ' as ' is more formal than ' because ' but 's ince ' is "" only suitable for informal conversation but nor for writing "" . the latter judgement seems to be in conformity with a prescriptivist view according to which 's ince ' as a causal conjunction is not to be used at all . ( i want to note that i have identified 209 ( = 13 % ) causal since-clauses among 1576 causal as - , because - , for - and since-clauses in the machine readable british - english lob - corpus ( written texts from 1961 ) . most of these since-clauses are to be found in the category called ' learned and scientific writing ' . ) another informant , for whom my example sentence ( 1 ) is essentially synonymous with either conjunction , has the impression that the speaker of ( 1 ) using ' because ' "" feels john 's admission more noteworthy , or more important to the narrative , than he or she would if 's ince ' or ' as ' were used . "" into the same direction , i assume , goes another judgement according to which ' because ' is "" stronger and more explicit and more exceptional . "" ( i have found a similar view in the literature and have interpreted it as a consequence of my differentiation : entailment on the basis of a rule or norm is intrinsically less noteworthy , less exceptional than ' real ' causation . ) some people have pointed out the relevance of the position of the causal clause . as a tendency , my rule / norm interpretation is considered to be more in accordance with the causal clause ( be it 's ince / as ' or ' because ' ) preceding its main / matrix clause . however , one informant feels "" more comfortable with since clauses preceding , and because clauses following , the main clause . "" ( this impression is somehow in conformity with the statistical situation in the above mentioned lob - corpus : only about 9 % of the because-clauses are preposed , whereas 41 % of the since-clauses and 43 % of the as-clauses are preposed there . ) one informant pointed out constraints which may affect the acceptability of 's ince ' as a causal conjunction : "" 's ince ' seems to have a much more limited application . for me there is a tense / aspect / ? ? ? constraint between the clauses ( consistent with the temporal meaning it also has ? ? ) , otherwise it sounds forced or stilted . i do n't really like your sentence ( 1 ) with 's ince ' . reversing the clauses makes it more acceptable to me , as does changing ' was ' to ' is ' ( strange ! ) . conversely , changing ' has been ' to ' was ' makes the 's ince ' version even less acceptable to me . "" ( probably , the last point in this quotation is caused by the fact that replacement of ' was ' by ' has been ' makes the sentence grammatically acceptable with a temporal interpretation of the since-clause . ) do i have to conclude from the ' empirical ' outcome of my query that my differentiation is not tenable ? for various reasons ( which i hope to develop convincingly in a doctoral dissertation to be submitted soon ) , i do not think so . are there , perhaps , some more people ' out there ' who agree with my claims , but who refrain from simply stating ' i agree ' ? of course , this would not make my query statistically more valid , but it would suggest that there is some plausibility to my non-empirical reasons . carsten breul e-mail : carsten . breul @ rz . ruhr-uni - bochum . de

""" syntax and the comparative method","concerning syntax and the comparative method : if i understand it correctly , amr @ ares . cs . wayne . edu ( no name ) apparently believes that under certain circumstances one can indeed use syntax as part of the comparative method and cites among other things , the case of a neuter plural in classical greek and old iranian used with a verb in the singular and its possible implications for a similar structure in the proto - language . while i do in theory believe that a particular construction can indeed survive the ravages of time and give us clues to the syntax of earlier levels , this must always be the last criterium we apply and can almost never be used as a sort of proof - unless of course , ( i believe scott de lancey mentioned it , but i ' m not sure ) we can show that , for example , all ergative case endings ( i believe the example was tibeto - burman ) can be traced back to a common form and the morphology , when reconstructed from the 'd aughter ' languages , conclusively points , in this case , to an ergative ' mother ' language . otherwise , john cowan seems to have summed it up best , citing robbin burling 's book : man 's many voices . . . just as every language at one point or another borrows lexemes from another langauge , there are literally thousands of examples of langauges borrowing syntactic constructions from other languages , whether substrats or not - even english has a good share of these borrowings . we cannot forget that an extremely large portion of the world 's population is by necessity bi - or tri-lingual , many of whom cannot even read their own native language , not to mention the other ( s ) or have any kind of linguistic training or sensiti - vity and would therefore pay much attention as to what language a particular construction comes from . there are also the famous ' sprachbunds ' , such as the balkan area and to a certain extent south asia , where through everyday necessity , a large part of the population speaks at least two langauges , as was shown in the case of the village along the maharastra - mysore boundary , ( mentioned by john cowan above ) where one can translate word-for - word from one language into another , although the languages are not - strictly speaking - related . in this case , though , it does n't even seem to make sense to speak of language families . in my opinion , the only possible connection is that of language contact or sprachbund . maybe that is part of the problem - what are ' related ' languages , anyway ? we must also remember that this process has undoubtedly been going on ever since people could speak . it would n't be difficult to propose , going back to our starting point , a theoretical language contact area for greek and iranian . for example , georgian , at least the modern language , only uses the plural verb for humans . although objects can appear in the plural , the verb appears in the singular . as there have always been greek ' colonies ' throughout the region , one could just as well assume a kind of sprachbund for the whole region at that time , which would be even easier as we know so little about the pre-historic era in that region , making it difficult to disprove . even today , there are certain ' areal ' characteristics such as evidential perfects , and many languages are , or have been at one point , split ergative in the region stretching from nepal to the caucusus , etc . seen in this light , then , we can't really speak of the ' oddity ' of the construction with a neutral plural taking a verb in the singular , which , by the way , in my opinion at least , does have a certain semantic justification and is by no means ' odd ' . concerning indo - aryan , the comparative method applied to syntax would certainly give us the ( wrong ) conclusion that vedic sanskrit was a split-ergative language , as all modern indo - aryan languages except standard oriya and begali ( and assamese ? ) are either ergative or split - ergative languages , and many dialects of these three langauges are also split-ergative languages . as there are several hundred ia ' langauges ' , would n't we be forced to assume that this goes back to the parent language ? but there is also a problem here with the traditional method . we have ( to a large extent ) cognate endings for the ergative case . so why is n't vedic a split-ergative language ? because we have gone back too far . split ergativity is part of the ' parent ' language , but this is presumably to be found in middle indic . for a language family about which we know next to nothing , then , this would certainly lead to tremendous errors . so , it seems to me that , although there are indeed useful insights to be gained by looking at the syntax , it should , as i stated earlier , always be the last criterium , if used at all , in arguing for a kind of genetic relationship . when we have no written history of the peoples of the area , very little in the way of documented sound changes , etc . , we simply cannot say anything yet about the syntactic structure of the proto-language . that will undoubtedly come about in the course of time , but it is just one of many features , none of which alone can ' prove ' anything , except perhaps contact . if there are enough of the ' unlikely ' correspondences ( i . e .

icla call for papers,"4th international cognitive linguistics conference july 17 - july 21 , 1995 , albuquerque , new mexico * aims and scope the international cognitive linguistics conference offers a forum for research within the perspective of cognitive linguistics . this perspective subsumes a number of concerns and broadly compatible theoretical approaches that share a common basis : the idea that language is an integral part of cognition which reflects the interaction of cultural , psychological , communicative , and functional considerations , and which can only be understood in the context of a realistic view of conceptualization and mental processing . topics of interest for cognitive linguistics include the structural characteristics of natural language categorization ( such as prototypicality , metaphor , mental imagery , and cognitive models ) , the functional principles of linguistic organization ( such as iconicity and naturalness ) , the conceptual interface between syntax and semantics , the experiential and pragmatic background of language-in - use , and the relationship between language and thought . in addition , topics of special interest for the 1995 conference include cross-linguistic studies and cognitive linguistic approaches to signed language research . * conference site the 1995 conference will take place on the campus of the university of new mexico ( unm ) in albuquerque . albuquerque lies between the foothills of the sandia mountains ( with peaks of more than 10 , 000 feet ) and the west mesa ( which is dotted with the cinder cones of long-extinct volcanoes ) ; dividing the city is the winding rio grande valley , famous for its bosque nature preserve . at an altitude of roughly 5000 feet , the university campus enjoys warm summer days and cool nights . excursions to nearby pueblos , santa fe , and the sandia mountains are being planned . also taking place at unm during the summer of 1995 is the linguistic society of america 's biennial linguistic institute . under the direction of joan bybee , li-95 will run for six weeks from late june to early august and will include over 50 courses taught by visiting faculty as well as special lectures . the conceptual structure for li-95 applies cross-linguistic comparison and a functional orientation to the major areas of linguistics and the language emphases of the university of new mexico program : signed languages , spanish , and native american languages . several other conferences are planned to precede and follow the 1995 icla conference . * submission of abstracts authors are requested to submit four copies of a one-page abstract in hardcopy format to the address below . abstracts must be received before november 30 , 1994 . authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by february 1 , 1995 . sherman wilcox / icla95 department of linguistics university of new mexico albuquerque , nm 87131

language and species,"a few posts on the subject have pleased me : i am perhaps not alone in having eccentric beliefs about non-human languages . it had started when i was hoping , after finishing my phd , to work on dolphins ' language ; it had continued when i read , somewhere , that the deaf 's sign language was not a language ( how did those people whom i saw meeting regularly in the pub down the road communicate , then , if they did not have a language ? i often envied them being stone deaf - - cursed with hearing as i am , i dislike noisy pubs and restaurants ) . a that stage , it got me thinking that "" proper "" human language dealt with encoding an n-dimensional conceptual universe into one-dimensional strings ( perhaps with a degenerate dimension extra , if you pay attention to prosodic features ) . that , sign language , on the other hand , encoded it into definitely two dimensions or more - - even though i could not figure out how many , let alone which , having found so little in the literature ( just as anyone doing linguistics should know at least a few foreign languages , perhaps , perhaps they should know at least some sign language , and have practiced it . when i say "" perhaps "" i mean "" definitely "" , of course . "" perhaps "" is a euphemism , a weak excuse for not having taken the time to learn and practice sign language ) . later , about dolphins ' languages , no * cetacean * in this case , i read , somewhere , the circumstances under which orcs had learnt to avoid boats equipped with harpoon guns , which seemed to mean that they must have been "" told "" how to recognize them by the first to meet those boats for the first time . this seemed too efficient . you just try to explain to someone how to recognize a contraption never encountered before . no paper and pencil , just words . misunderstandings galore . that got me thinking about another possible form of communication . cetaceans "" see "" by sonar , like bats . they communicate , we read , by sound , in a very wide range ( a few hertz to 100khz or more if memory serves ) . what if they actually communicated by * projecting * sonar images then ? paintings as it were , along with stylized representations . animated too , that 's quite possible . later again , i tied that in with what some will tell you about the intelligence of birds , how some mynah birds seem to understand a few words and use them in the proper context . the complexity of bird songs . the hopelessness of some schemes dreamt up to find out if animals communicated through language strikes me now . putting birds , or whatever , in different cages or pens , training one set to push the third lever from the left to get food ; see if they communicate their discovery to the those in the other pen . if they communicate by projected sonar image we are looking for the needle in the haystack . by song modulation , ditto . there would be , at any rate , dozens , nay , hundreds of ways of explaining "" push the third lever "" . how would * you * say "" lever "" if you had never had anything like it in your environment ? "" third "" ? "" from the left "" ? so even if they jabbered in a human-like language , one phoneme after the other , we would have a very hard time of spotting their exchange . you know the story about how they said "" piano "" in beach - la - mar : "" big fella box , he got black and white teeth , missus belong white master he fight ' im belong him , box he cry now "" . there 's more than one way to say "" piano "" that way ! i have , then , come to this notion that , when we meet non-human , sentient beings , we probably won't recognize the fact . that those definitions ( and redefinitions ) of language as human language with these and those features , and if it has n't got it then it is n't language , are utterly uninteresting . they would be at best entirely useless , only vacuous tautologies ( is n't that self-referencing ! ) . but in fact they can only be obnoxious , leading to methods incapable of recognizing and analyzing "" non-human "" languages . such as asl ( insert a sarcastic smiley here ) . to conclude on a related theme . i keep reading how the reconstructed vocal tract of neanderthals shows that they could not have a full language , because . . . blah blah ( i really am loath to repeat the argument ) . how about the vocal tract of a parrot , reconstructed from its skeleton ? j . guy @ trl . oz . au

comparative method,"the recent discussion of limitations on the comparative method contained several assertions that such limitations had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of remote relationships , including amerind and nostratic . to my knowledge this is absolutely false . in every instance that i am aware of in which perceived temporal limitations on the comparative method have been mentioned , it is by way of explaining why it is there are no relationships beyond a certain degree of remoteness on which there is consensus , or by way of making predictions as to what historical linguistics will ultimately be able to achieve . i do not know of a single instance in which someone has argued : such and such a proposed relationship is associated with a time-depth of x years . this exceeds the temporal limits of the comparative method . therefore the proposal must be wrong . if anyone can provide evidence of such an argument being made i would be most interested . in the particular case of amerind , the objections have been two-fold : ( a ) the data is riddled with errors ; ( b ) the argument is not of a sort that most historical linguists consider probative . since greenberg and ruhlen do not apply the comparative method disbelief in their claims could not rationally be based on perceived limitations of the comparative method , nor has it been . ironically , even if greenberg and ruhlen did attempt to apply the comparative method , amerind would not provide a very good instance of the above hypothetical argument . since even conservative estimates of the time-depth possible with the comparative method range from 6-10ky , cand since greenberg and ruhlen adhere to the low chronology for the peopling of the americas that places it at roughly 12ky bp , their date for amerind does not radically exceed the perceived limits of the comparative method . in sum , whatever the validity of proposed temporal limits on the comparative method , and i agree that such limits are far from exact , the view that this has anything to do with reactions to greenberg 's work on amerind and similar work is a red-herring . to evaluate such proposals , look at the data and look at the methodology , not at the alleged ( and generally unknowable ) motivations of the critics . you 'd think that the irrelevance of ad hominem arguments except in matters of credibility of witnesses would not need to be repeated constantly . bill poser bill poser , first nations studies , university of northern british columbia , 3333 university way , prince george , british columbia , v2n 4z9 , canada 604-960 - 6692

dick armey 's slip,"so dave wharton , having determined that the delay between richard armey 's "" barney fag "" remark and its correction lasted less than a second , is confident that it must have been "" a slip and not a slur "" ( presumably blameless ) , all the more since armey has a ph . d . and a wealth of political savvy and "" would not think it to his advantage to make such an utterance . "" a victim , then , of linguists with ulterior agendas . how in the in the world is one to respond to such a statement ? if wharton had made the suggestion 75 years ago you might repeat the observation that freud offered in the introductory lectures to the effect that the merely somatic or phonetic concommitents of slips can't explain why they occur when they do - - as he put it , it 's like telling a policeman that the darkness of the night and the isolation of the street have caused your purse to be snatched . what might have possessed armey , then ? the new republic has pointed out that he was one of only forty-seven members ( gingrich was not among them ) who voted against george bush 's hate crime statistics act , which allowed the government to record violence against homosexuals ; that he voted to exclude people with aids from the americans with disabilities act ; that he voted to deny government funds to groups that boycotted the boy scouts of america on the grounds of that organization 's anti-gay policies ; and that he refused to sign a voluntary statement saying that his own office did n't discriminate against homosexuals . of course the remark was n't "" intentional , "" but the evidence is pretty thick that armey harbors just the sorts of inner demons who would have been lying in wait for any breach in conscious attention . most inhabitants of the late 20th century will acknowlege some acquaintance with pesky creatures like these , and you would think that it would be only by an act of willful repression that someone could deny their existence entirely . but maybe we should give wharton the benefit of the doubt ; maybe his is a genuine victorian innocence . only , just think of it ! all those theorists arguing that we are living the twilight of modernist era , when there are still people ( with an "" edu "" in their address , yet ) on whom it has not even begun to dawn .

language policy,"admittedly , i ' m coming in on the middle of this discussion , having missed the earlier messages . however , i was struck by m . hale 's disturbing feelings about "" references to such ( non-linguistic ) issues as "" citizenship "" and "" ethnicity "" "" . how can you manage a language planning project without taking into consideration such non-linguistic factors , in addition to a study of language attitudes , government policies past and present , language of education and social mobility , etc . etc . ? and something else to think about perhaps . . . while the language planner ( s ) might not favor legal restrictions outright , the legal promotion of a language or languages , which seems like the opposite course , could actually lead to unofficial restrictions of the other language ( s ) . someone mentioned the case of spanish and english in the us . last week i heard a radio ( npr ? ) news report that some monolingual english speakers can't find work in the miami area because they do n't speak spanish ( the report was in reference to a politician 's support of making english the official language of the us ) . at a national / federal level , one could argue that spanish is a minority language ; at a local / city level , one could argue that it is not . do we have here a case of the promotion of spanish leading to unofficial restrictions on english - speakers , at least at a city level , in terms of employment opportunities ? my point is that the definition of "" minority language "" is going to depend on the specific situation . i am currently involved in a small-scale language planning project ( in the capacity of director ) and the toughest decisions i come across have to do with the "" non-linguistic "" factors : the people , the emotions , the feelings and the ideas they have towards the other people who do n't speak their language . even a small project is extremely complex . deborah du bartell , ph . d . linguistics program edinboro university of pennsylvania edinboro , pa 16444 usa 814-732 - 2736

qs : ideal reference grammars,"content - length : 15848 dear fellow linguist , if you are a user of reference grammars and are willing to invest some seven or ten minutes , you can contribute to shaping the format of an electronic framework for reference grammars we are about to develop . we are eager to have your opinion on what a good reference grammar should look like . for that purpose we have formulated a set of multiple choice questions plus some open questions , divided into four major groups : quantity , quality , organisation , ergonomy of reference grammar . if you have more than ten minutes , we would be happy to have your reactions also to the starred questions at the end of each group . the linear order of the questions does not correspond to a degree of relevance for us or the project . at the end of the questionnaire we ask you for your opinion on the relative importance of the different factors . to answer the multiple choice questions , please type an ' x ' between the appropriate pair of brackets . square brackets ' [ ] ' indicate that you should choose only one of the answers to the given question , parentheses ' ( ) ' indicate that you may choose several answers . subquestions are marked by inden - tation : if you have checked the superordinate question , please answer the subquestions as well . we will post a summary as soon as your answers have been evaluated . please send the completed questionnaire to the following address : pichler @ informatik . uni-muenchen . de thank you very much for your cooperation , the munich avg team roman pichler christian stroemsdoerfer vladimir tourovsky dietmar zaefferer = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 1 quantity = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 1 . 1 what do you expect a good reference grammar to contain ?

pardon the intrusion but you may want to read the following,"/ / pardon the intrusion , but you may want to read the following : / / hello ! my name is karen liddell ; i ' m a 35 - year-old mom , wife , and part-time accountant . as a rule , i delete all unsolicited "" junk "" e-mail and use my account primarily for business . i received what i assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time . about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , "" ok , i give in , i ' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash . "" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as we did . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to thebank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment and the income return is tremendous ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ you are about to make at least $ 50 , 000 in less than 90 days ! please read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the "" internet "" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now !

amta workshop on embedded mt systems - cfp,"workshop announcement - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - workshop on embedded mt systems call for papers design , construction , and evaluation of systems with an mt component wednesday , october 28 , 1998 ( preceding the amta 98 conference ) sheraton bucks county hotel , langhorne , pennsylvania introduction as the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation ( mt ) engines have become better understood and accepted , there has been a marked increase in the development of computer systems with anembedded mt component . one consequence of this shift to "" embedded mt "" is that researchers , developers , as well as users have begun pushing the limits on the input that such systems will accept for translation . in so doing , a new class of problems has surfaced : any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines andon statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of theworkshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems aretreated in different embedded mt systems and ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

re : 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism,"with regard to hoberman 's comment , it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . , "" forensic "" applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( = "" imperialism "" ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of "" pre-linguistic "" explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the "" barbarian "" languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are "" natural "" or "" conventional "" / are there "" correct "" words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures "" explain "" language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own sake . i do n't think that could logically be possible - - but what do i know ? in any case , this might give us some insights into the "" prehistory of linguistics "" , and also into the still present motivations of some linguists to attach themselves to this aspect of our culture . benji

on line versions of newspapers,"dear readers of the linguist list , as we are planning a research project which is going to address itself to the phenomenon of on line versions of newspapers and magazines ( from a linguistic , semiotic and media-studies point of view , but also from a psychological and information-technological perspective ) , we would like to know whether there are any colleagues out there who deal with a similar subject . we are in the know about some people and some projects , but we suspect there must be more people who share an interest in this highly topical issue , however do n't know of one another 's existence and engagement in the matter . we would be only too pleased to make contact with those people , i . e . with . . . you ! prof . dr . martin stegu chair of applied linguistics technical university of chemnitz d-09107 chemnitz germany e-mail : martin . stegu @ phil . tu-chemnitz . de

new service for linguist subscribers,"dear subscribers : the linguist list has just instituted a new service , which we ' re calling "" the notice board . "" the notice board can be found at : http : / / linguistlist . org / ~ notice / it is intended to help linguists make professional contacts and find practical information - - the kind of information that facilitates our professional activities but is not directly related to linguistic research . for example , you might post a notice on the notice board if : - you ' re spending your sabbatical in another city and want to find a house to rent - you need crash space or a roommate for a linguistics conference . - you want information about living conditions in a region where you ' ll be doing fieldwork . this is the kind of information-gathering that used to be one of the great advantages of email distribution lists . and , having benefited from it ourselves in the past , we have often regretted that the size of linguist 's subscriber list ( now over 9000 ) makes it impossible to post such inquiries in linguist issues . we hope that this "" linguist notice board "" on the world wide web will partly take the place of such postings . we will , of course , continue to post queries having to do with linguistic research and announcements of general interest ( jobs , fellowships , conferences , etc . ) on linguist . so you should continue to send these to the list . the notice board is designed for more personal requests and announcements ( but not "" lonely linguist seeks attractive , adventurous informant . . . "" the notice board won't be quite that personal . . . . ) please let us know if you have suggestions for its improvement . helen , anthony , daniel linguist moderators reminders : 1 ) linguist dissertation abstracts are now searchable . if you have n't yet entered your dissetation abstract , please do so at : http : / / linguistlist . org / dissop . html ( if you do n't have web access , send us an email message and we will be happy to enter your information for you . ) 2 ) linguist is in the process of creating a searchable directory of linguists . if you have n't done so , please enter informaion about yourself at : http : / / linguistlist . org / persop . html thanks !

"k . polgardi , vowel harmony","vowel harmony . an account in terms of governement and optimality by krisztina polgardi vowel harmony deals with some theoretical problems concerning the phenomenon of vowel harmony , in a framework combining insights from government phonology , optimality theory and lexical phonology . the study introduces and motivates the general framework and examines three issues . the first concerns the typology of vowel harmony systems and how an element-based feature theory , comprised of the three elements i , a and u and supplemented by the property of headedness , can account for all the different types of harmony . the second concerns the domain of harmony and the question of how to handle disharmonicity in the proposed model . the third involves the so-called neutral vowels , i . e . those vowels in a system that do not have a harmonic counterpart . it is claimed that the behaviour of neutral vowels can be predicted from their segmental make-up and from particular properties of the vowel systems involved . polgrdi argues that the theory of government phonology ( a principles-and - parameters approach ) needs to be supplemented by constraint ranking , because certain types of phenomena cannot be accounted for otherwise . since ranking is shown to be necessary , language variation can now be exclusively expressed by this device , and the notion of param - eters can be abandoned . polgrdi also argues that a non-derivational version of the strict cycle condition also needs to be incorporated into the theory to account for so-called derived environment effects ( of which disharmonicity is shown to be an example ) . 1998 . xii + 200 pp . isbn 90-5569 - 046 - 5 . paperback . lot interna - tional series 3 . hil / leiden university dissertation . price for individuals ordering directly from the publisher : nlg 36 , 90 , excl . vat and p&p . holland academic graphics , the hague < http : / / www . hag . nl > rint sybesma holland academic graphics po box 53292 2505 ag the hague the netherlands fax : + 31 70 448 0177",0
