basic word order,"this is a somewhat delayed reaction to frederick newmeyer 's posting on basic word order . i was prepared to let someone else comment on the underlying logic of newmeyer 's message . this did not happen , however , so here comes . newmeyer observes that data from a given language seldom exhibits an unambiguous ' basic word order ' , and there seem to be no generally agreed-upon criteria to resolve this ambiguity . he further notes that this fact reveals a weakness in functionalist linguistics ( or , in more polite terms , ' presents a challenge to it ' ) . he adds , on two occasions , that generative linguistics is increasingly coming to share the same weakness . by ` increasingly ' he must mean the fact that some applications of the principles-and - parameters approach are taking both language-particular and cross-linguistic data into account more seriously than used to be the case . before these developments , generative linguistics decreed that every ( configurational ) language has some sort of basic word order , as specified by the phrase structure ( or x - bar ) component of its grammar . newmeyer seems to suggest that this type of basic word order did not share the weakness that is ' increasingly ' becoming a characteristic of generative linguistics . the difference between earlier generative linguistics and current generative linguistics , and between their respective conceptions of basic word order , resides in the fact that the former did not , whereas the latter does , pay systematic attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data . newmeyer 's formulation then seems to suggest that not paying attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data is a strength of the theory . esa itkonen

sex bias and epicenes,"h . stephen straight is right to mention the importance of the essentially psychological evidence in favor of the idea that epicene he biases perceptions in favor male interpretations . there are considerable number of studies of this effect and a few attempts at interpretation as to how it comes about . essentially , the studies take two tacks . one model involves an interpretation task of some kind in which subjects are induced to provide some form of evidence of male or female interpretation of the referent of some generic epicene . the independent variable was the pronoun coreferent to epicene antecedents in invented sentences presented to subjects . subjects give names to characters , draw pictures , or say directly whether a character is male or female , etc . this type began back in 1970 , with an almost impossible to locate study by kidd . the most famous version was probably martyna 's ( 1978 , 1980 ) work and the latest version i am aware of was an experiment by gastil in 1990 . also , there were experiments by kosrohshahi in 1989 , moulton , robins , & elias in 1978 , and switzer in 1990 . the other type involves production tasks in which subjects selected a coreferential pronoun to complete sentences with antecedents refering generic epicene referents . here the independent variable was the degree of sex-stereotypicality of the generic referent ( e . g . marine vs . teenager vs . nurse ) . this type of study was inaugurated by martyna ( 1978 , 1980 ) . it was also used by gastil . in almost all studies uses of he strongly correlat with male interpretations of the referent . my own naturalistic data shows the same result with referents like ' lumberjack ' and ' particpants in congressional sex scandal ' used more with he than say ' child , ' or ' teacher . ' there are others along both lines , which will be supplied upon request . as for explanations , the most interesting ones for someone ( like me ) who tends to be skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on other aspects of cognition ( please let 's not start that one again ) are by mcconnell - ginet in a number of articles ( e . g . 1988 ) and moulton back in 1977 . moulton eschews notions of markedness and instead compares it to the kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinate category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical . so kleenex are most prototypical paper tissues , sanka is the prototypical decaf coffee ( in the us ) , and so on . note that this involves cognitive interaction with lexical semantics ; there is nothing morphosyntactic going on here . refs : ( i ' ll put full names whenever i remember ; i do n't want to look up all the arts . ) gastil , john ( 1990 ) "" generic pronouns and sexist language sex roles , 23 629-643 kidd , v .

comparative syntax,"while i really like most of what scott delancey had to say about syntactic reconstruction usually being based on clues buried in the morphology ( or morphophonology ) , i do n't think this is always the case . there is a rather famous example involving a rule of ancient greek and one variety of old iranian ( the languages of the gatha 's , i seem to recall ) , whereby a neuter pl . subject triggers sg . agreement on a verb , a pattern which is often reconstructed for the proto-language because , as i understand it , of its apparent oddity . this reconstruction is not logically dependent , i do n't believe , on the identity of the actual morphemes marking gender , number , and person in these languages . i would think that there are many such quirks of syntax which could be the basis of a reconstruction . e . g . , polish and several other indo - european languages show traces of a pattern whereby an np referring to a group composed of males and females is grammatically neuter . i have been playing around with the idea of trying to reconstruct this as an old pattern which would be quite independent of the particular number morphemes involved ( b . t . w . , if anyone knows of any literature on this phenomenon , i would be grateful for any references and will post them in summary form ) . another example ( which is not so interesting , because we happen to know the history ) : russian does various complicated things with the case / number endings of the nouns and adjectives when combined with numerals . thus , in the nominative case , ' these adj n ' and ' two adj n ' show different adj and noun forms in russian , where in the presence of a numeral from 2 to 4 the adj has to be in what looks the gen . pl . form ( unless it is feminine , when either the gen . pl . or the gen . sg . is possible ) and the noun in what looks like the gen . sg . form ( except for one or two nouns which seem to take a special form differing in stress placement from the gen . sg . ) . closely related polish , on the other hand , does nothing special in this case ( though both languages do other weird things with numerals above 4 , which need not concern us ) . i wonder if we would not be able to conclude from such behavior that the ancestor of these languages had a distinct paucal number ( 2 - 4 being paucal ) category , which then merged with the plural in polish , but stayed distinct in russian ( with the further hypothesis that some of the paucal endings must have looked like the genitive sg . ones ) . and an even further hypothesis might be that the paucal was originally dual , since paucal is a very unusual category to have . of course , we know that this is what happened , but i wonder if we could not have reconstructed it even if had not known . so , provided the syntactic patterns are distinctive ( e . g . , weird ) enough , purely syntactic comparative reconstruction should be possible ( and i bet that we could even find some more examples of it in the literature besides the greek - iranian one cited above ) . the problem only seems impossible when we consider patterns which are quite prosaic ( and where the number of possibilities is small ) , like the so-called basic word order that has been talked about so much in this discussion . even there , i think , that if we looked at the detailed facts of word order ( not just ov , vo , and the like ) in a group of languages , we might be able to reconstruct the proto - system of word order with some degree of confidence . and even the basic order might be reconstructable enough if we have enough languages with enough diversity and ( geographical ) dispersion between them . the fact that classical latin was often verb-final , while all the romance languages are verb-middle or verb-initial , does not seem to be a very important counterexample , because ( a ) vernacular latin may well have been much more verb - middle than the literary and it is only the former that is relevant , ( b ) the romance languages do not exhibit very much diversity or dispersion . for ex . , does it not seem clear that we can reconstruct ov for proto - turkic and proto - mongolic ? and vo for proto - polynesian ?

closure of famous department of linguistics,"we have just heard that the department of linguistics of the school of oriental and african studies in london is threatened with closure . members of the department heard of it this week ; there has been no previous consultation . the school has had its funds cut and decided to cut down on all its publications programme and on its linguistics activities . the department threatened has an illustrious history ; the first ever chair of linguistics in britain was held in soas by firth . at present the members of the department include dr david bennett , prof . theodora bynon , dr wynn chao , dr monik charette , dr katrina haywood , dr dick haywood fba , dr hewitt , dr bruce ingham , prof . jonathan kaye , prof ruth kempson fba , prof . emeritus r . h . robins fba . it is useless to stress how distinguished the department is and how much a school which has primary responsibility for the study of oriental and african languages needs to have a department of linguistics and phonetics . letters of protest should be addressed to the director , school of oriental and african studies , thornhaugh street , russell square , london wc1 , england . it would be useful to send copies to the chairman of the department ( dr d . bennett ) at the same address and to the vice - chancellor of the university of london , senate house , malet street , london wc1 , england . the fax number of soas is44 - 71-436 - 3844 . anna morpurgo davies

lrec workshop announcement,"adapting lexical and corpus resources to sublanguages and applications a workshop to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 the workshop will provide a forum for those researchers involved in the development of methods to integrate corpora and mrds , with the aim of adding adaptive capabilities to existing linguistic resources . organisers : roberto basili ( university of roma "" tor vergata "" ) , roberta catizone ( university of sheffield ) , maria teresa pazienza ( university of roma "" tor vergata "" ) , paola velardi ( university of roma "" la sapienza ) , yorick wilks ( university of sheffield ) workshop scope and aims lexicons , i . e . , those components of a nlp system that contain "" computable "" information about words , cannot be considered as static objects . words may behave very differently in different domains , and there are language phenomena that do not generalize across sublanguages . lexicons are a snapshot of a given stage of development of a language , normally provided without support for adaptation changes , whether caused by language creativity and development or the shift to such a previously unencountered domain . the divergence of corpus usages from lexical norms has been studied computationally at least since the late sixties , but only recently has the availability of large on-line corpora made it possible to establish methods to cope systematically with this problem . an emerging branch of research is now involved in studies and experiments on corpus-driven linguistics , with the aim of complementing and extending earlier work on lexicon acquisition based on machine readable dictionaries ( mrd ) : data are extracted from texts , as embodiments of language in use , so as to capture lexical regularities and to code them into operational forms . the purpose of this workshop will be to provide an updated snapshot of current work in the area , and promote discussion of how to make progress . central topics will be ( though this list is in no way exclusive ) : * corpus-driven tuning of mrds to optimize domain-specific inferences , * terminology and jargon acquisition , * sense extensions , * acquisition of preference or subcategorization information from corpora * taxonomy adaptation , * statistical weighting of senses etc . to domains * use of mrds to provide explanations of linguistic phenomena in corpora * what is the scope of "" lexical tuning "" * the evaluation of lexical tuning as a separate task , or as part of a more generic task industrial panel * * * new * * * * automatic adaptation of lexicons to new domains through the use of application corpora makes nlp applications more adaptable and portable . the program commettee is organizing a joint panel to discuss this ( and other ) issues concerning next generation information extraction systems . the panel intends to bring industrial representatives to confront expectations in ie from their viewpoint and degree of maturity of the offering . the following ( and other ) issues will be discussed : - is there a market for ie ? - what is the demand in domains such as new services for the citizens , telecommunications , management support , etc ? - what are the technical requirements ? is the technology near to the market ? program committee yorick wilks university of sheffield roberta catizone university of sheffield paola velardi university of roma "" la sapienza "" maria teresa pazienza university of roma "" tor vergata "" roberto basili university of roma "" tor vergata "" bran boguraev brandeis university sergei nirenburg new mexico state university james pustejowsky brandeis university ralph grishman new york university christiane fellbaum princeton university paper submission formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 00198 roma italy electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or word per mac or rtf . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to paola velardi ( velardi @ dsi . uniroma1 . it ) even important dates * * * * * ( please note extended deadline ) * * * * * * paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) march 10 paper notification april 1 camera - ready papers due april 20 l&ct workshop may 26 prof . paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 universita ' "" la sapienza "" 00198 roma ph . + 39 - ( 0 ) 6-49918356 fax + 39 - ( 0 ) 6-8541842 8841964

silverman book review,"silverman , daniel . ( 1997 ) . phasing and recoverability . outstanding dissertations in linguistics series . new york : garland publishing . 242 pages . reviewed by stefan frisch , university of michigan . this book is a revised version of the author 's 1995 ucla dissertation . the primary thesis defended by silverman is that auditory salience plays an important role in explaining the typology of phonological segment inventories . the relative phasing of laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures is examined as a case study . silverman demonstrates there is a typological preference for phasing patterns in which the gestures are optimally recoverable . further , he proposes that sub-optimal patterns are only found in inventories where the optimal patterns are also present . ( note that silverman does not crucially adopt the segment as a phonological primitive . he is concerned primarily with gestures and their realization in a system of syntagmatic contrasts . the terms 's egment ' and 's egment inventory ' are used only for expository convenience . ) synopsis : chapter 1 . introduction this chapter introduces the primary thesis : cross - linguistically , laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures are phased to make their values maximally auditorily salient . silverman argues that parallel production of contrastive gestures is informationally optimal , but only if those gestures are auditorily recoverable . in cases where parallel production would make contrastive values unrecoverable , gestures are serially sequenced . for example , in aspirated stops , laryngeal abduction is sequences to follow the stop closure , resulting in broadband noise . if laryngeal abduction and stop closure were simultaneous , the state of the larynx would not be recoverable from the resulting acoustic signal ( silence ) . silverman also introduces the ' gestural score ' notation of articulatory phonology ( browman & goldstein , 1986 ) used in the description of the gestural patterns . each gestural score is accompanied by a set of temporally aligned descriptions of acoustic cues which highlight the importance of the recoverability of the gestures . the resulting segmental percept is also given , to highlight whether all of the contrastive segmental information has been effectively transmitted . using this notation , he exemplifies the four logically possible phasing patterns : parallel , sequenced , expanded , or truncated . in the parallel phasing pattern , two gestures are phased to be fully simultaneous . in the sequenced pattern , two gestures are serially ordered . in the expanded pattern , one gesture both begins before and ends after another . in the truncated pattern , one gesture is phased to be simultaneous with a portion ( beginning or end ) of another gesture . chapter 2 . previous work in this chapter , silverman reviews previous research on articulatory timing , auditory response to acoustic signals , and the relevance of auditory contrastiveness to segmental inventories . two results are of particular importance . first , a combination of auditory factors favor patterns where low intensity signals are followed by high intensity signals . second , languages employ contrasts which are maximally auditorily distinct . chapter 3 . obstruents and laryngeal gestures this chapter contains typological evidence to support silverman 's thesis . cross - linguistically , laryngeal gestures of abduction or constriction are overwhelmingly phased to follow supralaryngeal constriction , which maximizes the recoverability of both gestures . the sub-optimal pattern , where the laryngeal gesture precedes the stop release is found only when the optimal pattern is also present . for obstruents , which have a minimum of acoustic energy to work with , these are the only two phasing patterns . chapter 4 . sonorants and laryngeal gestures sonorants have a greater amount of acoustic energy , and so laryngeal gestures can overlap with supralaryngeal gestures . the most attested pattern , for languages which do have a laryngeal contrast for sonorants , is for the laryngeal gesture to be truncated to the beginning portion of the supralaryngeal gesture . parallel to the obstruent case , this phasing pattern puts the low-energy breathy or glottalized portion of the sonorant before the high-energy modally-voiced portion , maximizing auditory salience . again , the less optimal pattern truncates the laryngeal gesture to the latter portion of the supralaryngeal gesture . ordinarily , the laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures are not completely overlapped , as contrastive supralaryngeal gestures ( such as nasal place of articulation , for example ) would be rendered non - recoverable . however , an interesting special case is found in laterals . due to the formant structure of laterals , languages generally do not have contrasts in their place of articulation . thus , in some cases ( e . g . zulu ) , contrastive laryngeal gestures are realized fully parallel with the supralaryngeal gesture . a similar pattern is found for coda nasals in comaltapec chinantec , where the place of articulation is contextually determined . in contrast to onset nasals , which have contrastive place of articulation , laryngeal abduction is realized in parallel with the supralaryngeal gesture in coda nasals and no contrasts are lost . chapter 5 . vowels and laryngeal gestures in this chapter , vowels with contrastive laryngeal gestures are discussed . silverman claims that , since vowels have an abundance of acoustic energy , laryngeal gestures can be implemented in parallel with supralaryngeal gestures without loss of auditory contrast . however , this pattern is auditorily the least optimal . like the sonorant case , the optimal pattern is for the laryngeal gesture to be truncated to the beginning portion of the vowel , resulting in ? v or hv sequences . less optimal is the opposite phasing pattern , resulting in v ? or vh . typologically hv is indeed much more prevalent than voiceless vowels or vh ( and similarly for laryngeal constriction ) . the bulk of the chapter ( and the book ) is devoted to ' laryngeally complex ' vowels in the otomanguean languages . the term larygeally complex is used for vowels which realize both contrastive phonation ( breathy or creaky ) and tone . one example , comaltapec chinantec , has eight vowel qualities with five tonal qualities and two voice qualities . in addition , this language has nasalization and a length contrast which leads to 320 possible realizations of the nucleus . not surprisingly , words in this language are generally monosyllabic , and nucleus quality is used to differentiate many of the lexical contrasts . silverman argues that simultaneous realization of breathiness / creakiness and tone would render the tone contrasts unrecoverable . the cross-linguistically prevalent pattern is for the laryngeal contrast to be truncated to the beginning of the vowel , which is auditorily optimal . the tone is then saliently realized during modal phonation in the latter portion of the vowel . the opposite sequencing , with the laryngeal after the tonal contrast ( and modal phonation ) is also attested . silverman finds only two cases where tonal and laryngeal contrasts are executed simultaneously ( the tibeto - burman languages mpi and tamang ) . in one of those cases , there are only two tones , so tonal contrasts may not be in as much danger , as the tones would be more distinct than in the case of comaltapec chinantec , with eight tones . critical evaluation : overall , this is an inspirational volume demonstrating the importance of auditory / phonetic explanation for phonological patterning . it is one of the first of a series of ucla dissertations on this topic , which together address a wide range of phonological phenomena . silverman 's analysis bridges the phonetics / phonology gap in a number of ways . for example , an arbitrary number of phasing differences , which might be dismissed as ' phonetic implementation ' , are shown to be reducible to a small set that can be phonologically contrastive . this reduction , via the more abstract temporal relationships of simultaneity and precedence , nicely complements work in speech perception on the cross-linguistic ( and cross-species ) robustness of the categorical perception of voice onset time continua ( kuhl & miller , 1975 ; pisoni , 1977 ) . to its credit , this book contains over a dozen reasonably detailed case studies on the realization of laryngeal contrasts in different languages . in many cases , recordings were available so the presence of the phasing relationships were verified , and spectrograms of appropriate examples are given . these case studies often address potential counterexamples to silverman 's typological claims . for example , the mon - khmer language chong possesses coda stops with contrastive creakiness , but creakiness is realized only in the non-optimal way as a pre-glottalized stop . in the chong case , however , other aspects of the morphophonology require the non-optimal realization to avoid loss of contrast . in particular , coda stops are obligatorily unreleased , and the language is non-suffixing . due to these additional constraints , post-glottalized phasing would not saliently encode the larygneal contrast . this type of constraint interaction is quite compatible with the general approach of optimality theory ( prince & smolensky , 1993 ) , and in fact the original version of this dissertation presented constraint tableau in such cases . the proposed constraints are quite broad and were informally described , so the optimality theoretic analysis did not add to the exposition , and the book reads more easily without it . despite the lack of a formalist analysis , this book raises a number of issues which are relevant to current formal concerns . in the otomanguean language copala trique there are different phasing relationships between vocalic and laryngeal gestures . the laryngeal gestures ( breathiness and creakiness ) can be truncated to the first portion of the vowel , the second portion of the vowel , or can ' interrupt ' the vowel , appearing in the middle . these three locations for a laryngeal gesture support lexical contrasts , and there is clear evidence that the interrupted vowels are monosyllabic . encoding these three configurations using more abstract representations than articulatory phonology is no trivial task . in addition , the correspondence theory approach to faithfulness considers segmentally aligned and ordered input and output ( mccarthy & prince , 1995 ) . the presence of relatively small but contrastive differences in phasing require subsegmental correspondence relations between the input and output . another missing aspect of an optimality theoretic analysis would be a factorial typology of constraint interactions . while silverman 's coverage is quite extensive , i would be interested in seeing a discussion of the pros and cons for each logical possibility in phasing between laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures . such a discussion will eventually be needed in order to determine whether the silverman 's proposal is is truly predictive , or just informally defined to the extent that any observed pattern could be explained . in a few instances , silverman makes use of the upsid database of segmental inventories ( maddieson , 1986 ) to demonstrate that the typological predictions are satisfied . unfortunately , quantitative differences are not reported in most cases . while sufficient data may not be available , a quantitative analysis is desirable in order to address a current question in work on phonetic explanation for phonological patterns : are non-optimal patterns avoided to the degree that they are non-optimal ? in other words , is the hypothesized functional force of auditory recoverability transparently reflected in the patterns within and across languages , or is it ' phonologized ' in some way by the language learner such that there is no quantitative relationship ? the answer to this question has implications for the architecture of the phonetically grounded grammar , as quantitative constraints or quantitative constraint rankings would be required . this book touches on a number of other very important issues that should be topics of ongoing research . the central role of the recoverability of contrasts leads inevitably to the question : what is a contrast ? assuming the psychological reality of the segment provides a simple answer , but one which is not entirely correct . the three contrastive phasing relationships in copala trique are not amenable to a segmental analysis . in chong , a combination of coda unrelease and lack of suffixation is claimed to lead to pre-glottalized stops . this case is contrasted with korean , where there is some suffixation , and post-glottalized stops are maintained in that environment but neutralized elsewhere . i wonder how frequent the neutralizing environment must be before a non-optimal pattern becomes necessary or the contrast is lost ? why is n't the laryngeal gesture phased before the stop closure in the neutralizing environment , but after in the non-neutralizing environment ? perhaps some other constraint is involved here . in many of the case studies given , the simple syllable structure and monosyllabic tendencies of the languages are mentioned as reasons why complex and non-optimal phasing relations are found at all ( in most cases , the optimal recoverability of supralaryngeal gestures is found if contrastive laryngeal gestures are not used at all ) . this suggests that there is some minimal set of contrasts required to create a sufficient number of open class items for a language to be a useful communication system , and that differences in syllable structure , word length , and segmental inventory size interact in some fashion to this end . the answers to these deeper questions appear to be closer to our understanding when the phonological system is conceptualized as implied in this book , as a combinatorial system of articulatory / acoustic contrasts highly constrained by a variety of functional factors . references :

( birgitta englund dimitrova mentions that this article has ever since been widely quoted in research on translation . ) the context is the division of labor between lexical and grammatical means , which may vary considerably from language to language , and the problems this poses for translation : "" if some grammatical category is absent in a given language , its meaning may be translated into this language by lexical means . . . . it is more difficult to remain faithful to the original when we translate into a language provided with a certain grammatical category from a language devoid of such a category . . . . as boas neatly observed , the grammatical pattern of a language ( as opposed to its lexical stock ) determines those aspects of each experience that must be expressed in the given language . . . . in order to translate accurately the english sentence "" i hired a worker , "" a russian needs supplementary information , whether this action was completed or not and whether the worker was a man or a woman . . . ) languages differ essentially in what they _ must _ convey and not in what they ) > _ may _ convey . each verb of a given language imperatively raises a set of specific yes-no - questions . . . "" b . the second quotation is : jakobson , roman ( 1959 ) ' boas ' view of grammatical meaning ' in w . goldschmidt ( ed . ) , the anthropology of franz boas , memoirs of the american anthropological association 89 . 139-45 . reprinted in jakobson , roman ( 1971 ) selected writings vol . ii , the hague : mouton . 489-496 . the quoted sentence is on p . 492 . here the context is boas ' obligatoriness criterion for the distinction between grammatical and lexical meaning . jakobson quotes from boas : "" . . . ' a paucity of obligatory aspects does not by any means imply obscurity of speech . when necessary , clarity can be obtained by adding explanatory words . ' to denote time or plurality , those languages which have no tense or grammatical number resort to lexical means . ) thus the true difference between languages is not in what may or may not be ) > expressed but in what must or must not be conveyed by the speakers . "" ( am i right as a non-native speaker of english in suspecting that my fellow non-native speaker has possibly confounded ' must not ' with ' need not ' ? ) 3 . motivation for the query = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = i am using the ( first ) quote in a typological context , as motto for a paper where i discuss some of the consequences the obligatoriness of definiteness and number marking has for those cases of use where the speaker wants to evade these constraints . i argue there that languages with a high degree of explicitness ( many obligatory choices ) also provide for standard weakening strategies . if any typologist out there wants to engage in a discussion about the explicitness parameter , i would be happy to hear from him . to trigger the appropriate keywords , let me just mention that james huang 's ' temperature ' parameter ( the metaphor goes back , via haj ross , to marshall mcluhan ) is just a special case of the explicitness parameter . according to huang ( li 15 , 1984 , pp . 531-574 ) , languages with a high degree of obligatoriness in the expression of anaphoric elements are ' hot ' ( little audience participation required ) , whereas languages with a preference for zero anaphora are ' cool ' ( more audience participation required ) . let me conclude with another quote from the first paper of rj : "" equivalence in difference is the cardinal problem of language and the pivotal concern of linguistics .

date formats,"hello , this is a query about the different ways in which dates can be expressed in different languages , and whether there are constraints that apply in relation to register ( eg formal , informal , etc ) , genre ( magazine , newspaper , personal vs business letter , etc ) , historical , instrumental ( format of calendars ) , nationality , etc . my initial impressions are the following . as far the english speaking world goes , in britain there is a variety of ways in which dates can be expressed in writing , including day month year ; day-ordinal month year ; month day , year ; month day-ordinal , year . interestingly , this variety is not found in numerical form , in which ` day / month / year ' is expected . note that the separators vary , the most common being the slash ( / ) , others being the dash ( - ) , the period ( . ) and the blank space ( ) . in the other formats in which words are used , only the ` month ' slot can be spelled out , with days and years being expressed in numbers . variations include the use of ` the ' preceding ordinal day numbers . sometimes one can find different formats being used in different parts of the same publication , eg the header and the report in a newspaper . this seems to be in contrast with the usa where ` month day , year ' seems to predominate whatever the situation , even when expressed numerically as in 1 / 7 / 95 which is normally read by americans as the seventh day of the month of january , whereas the british would take it to mean the first day of the month of july , which is a 6 - month difference . apparently , the americans are the only ones to adopt month / day / year . someone once told me this is an old format which came into being as a result of the fact that , in looking for today 's date , one would look in a calendar first of all for the current month , with the year being taken for granted . any ideas ? what 's the norm in other languages / dialects , etc ? thanks in advance , tony - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tony berber sardinha | tony1 @ liverpool . ac . uk aelsu | fax 44-51 - 794-2739 university of liverpool | po box 147 | http : / / www . liv . ac . uk / liverpool l69 3bx | ~ tony1 / homepage . html uk | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

summary of ' bubbler ',"a few months ago i posted an inquiry on the linguist listing on the distribution of the word "" bubbler "" as a synonym for drinking fountain . thanks to all who responded , which are too many to list . the dictionary of american regional english has also extensively investigated this word and it was my goal to gain more specific information than that supplied by dare ( for example , the regional distribution within wisconsin . ) here is a summary of my findings : in wisconsin , bubbler is used throughout the eastern half of the state , particularly along the coast of lake michigan and becomes less prominent the further west one travels . the "" stronghold "" of bubbler appears to be in milwaukee and its suburbs . milwaukee is also thought to be the geographic origin of bubbler , coined by the kohler company in the early 1900 's . my university ( uw - whitewater ) appears to be in conflict over what to call drinking fountains . in one of our residence halls there is a sign asking residents to not use the drinking fountain as a garbage disposal . the word 'd rinking ' is crossed out , and ' water ' is put in its place . then ' water ' and ' fountain ' are crossed out , and ' bubbler ' is put in their place . it goes to show you that people can be very loyal to their colloquialisms ! my research provided no evidence for the term 's use in minnesota or illinois , but i did find the word in use along the western part of michigan 's upper peninsula ( which borders wisconsin 's bubbler-using region . ) if bubbler is used anywhere else in the midwest , its existence escaped my research . in fact , i found no evidence of the word 's use within the u . s . west of the mississippi or south of the ohio river . the other region that uses the term includes the state of rhode island ( where it is used exclusively by many speakers ) , far eastern connecticut , and southeastern massachusetts - including the boston area . i had people from this region respond with amusement because they did n't know the word was used anywhere outside of their area . lastly , and much to my surprise , bubbler is used in southeastern australia - predominately in new south wales ( including sydney and canberra ) and in portions of the provinces bordering new south wales . the information on australia is only based on a few responses , but there were some , especially in sydney , who used bubbler exclusively while growing up . there were some from parts of australia who had never heard the term before , so it does appear that it is also regionally distributed in australia . there were some who distinguished bubblers from drinking fountains . some only called outside fountains , bubblers , while others vice versa . one only called non-refridgerating fountains , bubblers . drinking fountain seems to be the generic term that everyone is familiar with , whether they use it or not . other synonymns are : water fountain , water cooler , fountain , and water bubbler . for what its worth , the only accounts i had of the term ' water bubbler ' were among african americans from milwaukee ( but this only included three people . ) just plain ' fountain ' seemed to be the word of choice in northwestern wisconsin , while drinking fountain and water fountain were used pretty interchangeably everywhere else . as for its use in literature , the only printed documentation of bubbler i could find ( under the given definition ) was a 1985 milwaukee journal article which was about the word 's usage in milwaukee . i realize that some of my findings are inconsistent with dare - i believe this is because my research was not nearly as thorough as dare , and did n't take into account historical usage , only current usage . thanks again to those who responded . your avid bubbler user , sean christensen internet : seanc @ iclnet93 . iclnet . org university of wisconsin - whitewater

"fracas project ( computational semantics ) - deliverables , www home page","we would like to announce the world wide web page of the fracas project , at url : http : / / www . cogsci . ed . ac . uk / ~ fracas / fracas - a framework for computational semantics - is a two-year , lre - funded project studying theories of semantic interpretation and their application in natural language processing . the participants in the project are cwi amsterdam , sri cambridge , and the universities of edinburgh , saarbruecken , and stuttgart . the deliverables produced in the first year of the project are available : from our www site ; by ftp at ftp . cogsci . ed . ac . uk , directory pub / fracas ; or by sending mail to fracas @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk .

sintassi comparata dell ' accordo participiale ramanzo,"michele loporcaro sintassi comparata dell ' accordo participiale romanzo rosenberg & sellier , torino , 1998 isbn 88-7011 - 719 - 7 , 272 pages , lit . 65 . 000 address of the publisher : via andrea doria 14 , i-10123 torino grosenb @ tin . it ( credit cards accepted ) this book offers a comprehensive account of romance past participle ( pp ) agreement in verbal periphrastics , a much-debated topic in romance linguistics as well as in theoretical syntax . its main bulk consists of a systematic inventory of agreement systems throughout romance ( chs . 3 - 4 ) , which is unprecedented as to both empirical coverage and level of detail . beside the standard languages , dialects ( especially , but by no means exclusively , italo - romance ones ) are considered thoroughly , based in part on first-hand data . one of the basic points of this work is that no sensible account of pp agreement can be arrived at without in-depth consideration of dialect variation . more than sixty different systems are taken into account : for virtually all of them the discussion is not limited to selected syntactic constructions , but rather encompasses the whole set of verbal periphrastics ( both perfective and passive ) consisting of auxiliary + pp . among the agreement systems analyzed here several have not been previously described . the presentation of romance syntactic variation in chapters 3 and 4 is preceded by two introductory chapters and followed by three more theoretically oriented ones . ch . 1 deals with traditional accounts of pp agreement in romance linguistics and shows why a fresh look at the phenomena at issue is needed . ch . 2 introduces the aims and method of the present monograph , which is cast in the framework of relational grammar . after the assessment of dialect variation in pp agreement ( chs . 3 - 4 ) , ch . 5 shows that the analysis developed to account for it naturally projects onto diachrony . the steps through which pp agreement has evolved over time from latin to romance are shown to closely match the parametric options evidenced by synchronic geographic variation . ch . 6 compares the achievements of the present study with competing approaches to pp agreement developed within the principles and parameters approach ( or earlier versions of generative grammar ) . one of the main results of this comparison is the recognition of the fact that proposals put forward by generative grammarians - in spite of seeming differences , due to the theoretical machinery used - are very much in keeping with the descriptive tradition discussed ( and criticized ) in ch . 1 . ch . 6 also contains a discussion of pp agreement in the acquisition of italian as a first language . this domain of empirical data can be naturally unified with dialectal and diachronic variation under the approach developed here . ch . 7 finally synthesizes the results and elaborates on the internal articulation of the parametric conditions involved in pp agreement throughout romance varieties . the concluding table ( 29 ) displays in half a page all the syntactically relevant information that is both necessary and sufficient to exhaustively characterize pp agreement through space and time across romance . finally , a list of keywords for this book would have to include a number of related issues that must be dealt with in connection with pp agreement and which are in fact repeatedly touched upon in the seven chapters . among these , auxiliary selection and the contrast between agreement of pps and of adjectival predicates figure most prominently . other topics discussed range from the syntactic nature of clitics to the representation of reflexives , impersonal constructions , and existentials , to mention just a few . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

query on spanish and binding,"this is a request for help , in the form of references , suggestions , etc . , on a syntactic problem ( or maybe only an apparent problem ) . i have recently stumbled upon some interesting spanish data which seem to violate binding principles . in particular , my informants have provided examples like juan hablo a pedro de / sobre el and insist that el can can have as its antecedent at least juan , and perhaps also pedro . if the facts are what they seem , binding principle 2 is clearly violated , since we have a pronoun which is not free in the local domain . there are also cases , although not so clear , in which an anaphor seems not to be bound in the local domain . any thoughts on such examples will be greatly appreciated . if there is interest , i will post a summary of responses received . thanks . steve seegmiller seegmiller @ apollo . montclair . edu

discussion : english only,"one point that jack aubert made in his recent posting is dead on : quite apart from any putative intention on the part of policy makers , in the u . s . today "" bilingualism "" rarely means the ability to speak two languages fluently . i ' m thinking particularly about so - - called bilingual classes in our public schools , where many people get their first notion of what this word refers to . i have enrolled my children in these classes whenever possible , but with this decision comes the responsibility to attempt to convince administrators that native speakers of english must be required to learn some spanish in these classes . ( the bilingual classes at my children 's schools are always spanish - - english . ) it has never been expected in any of the bilingual classes my kids have been in that they should be studying two languages too ! these classes are run as a one-way street - - - and everyone knows it . as one little girl ( required to enroll ) in my daughter 's class told me , "" bilingual means you ' re dumb . "" hmmmmmmmmmm what people say the word ` bilingual ' means in your standard want ad is probably too hot an issue to handle . ( is this a new ` ` urban myth ' ' that such ads are actually seeking people of certain ethnicity ? ) i suspect that the term is coming to mean something quite different than its traditional denotation , and sometime soon we ' ll find that the word ` ` bilingual ' ' activates a number of presuppositions about both mastery of english and ethnic identity , not unlike what happened to the term ` ` illegal immigrant ' ' , as was demonstrated in various reports which were released at the time of the debate on prop 187 . this sort of change in the use of the word ` bilingual ' will not help anyone whose goal is to encourage the study and use of more than one language in the u . s . because non - - experts , if they do not control language policy , are certainly involved in that policy making . i suggest that the way to combat it is very local action : take the time to talk to the principal ( s ) of your local public elementary school ( s ) . robin schafer rschafer @ ucsd . edu

how are sign languages understood in real time ( specifically , what mechanisms are required to interpret co-reference conveyed spatially ? what are the effects of late language acquisition on language processing ? how does experience with a signed language impact non-linguistic visual-spatial cognition ( specifically , face processing , memory , and imagery ) ? what is the nature of working memory for sign language ? what is the neural organization for signed and spoken language ? specifically , what brain areas are involved in the comprehension and production of spatial language ( i . e . , describing space with classifiers or prepositions ) ? dr . emmorey 's keynote address will focus on only a small subset of these questions . she will address the consequences of using signing space to describe physical space for language and cognitive processing . dr . carol padden dr . padden received her bachelor of science degree in linguistics from georgetown university , and her ph . d . , also in linguistics , from the university of california at san diego . her current work is in the area of reading ability in signing deaf children , and areas of interest include : culture and language , representational systems in sign languages ( for example , fingerspelling ) , and reading development in young deaf children . the topic of her keynote presentation will be : reading research with signers : a new research direction . dr . lars wallin dr . wallin is a faculty member at the university of stockholm , in stockholm , sweden , in the department of sign language . he was born deaf and attended a deaf school growing up . he got his phd in sign language , 1994 , at stockholm university , writing his thesis on polysynthetic signs in swedish sign language . his phd was the first phd in sign language in the world ( others took phd in linguistics or other subjects , but not in sign language . ) he was also the first deaf person in sweden to get his phd . his current work is researching and training in sign language linguistics at stockholm university . his current research is on : the use of classifier signs as free forms in noun phrases in narrative discourse in swedish sign language ; the use of handshapes and movements as bound morphemes in signs describing shape and size of the entities in swedish sign language . pre-conference workshop thursday , november 12 , 2 : 00 - 5 : 00 p . m . we are offering a workshop for those who are not familiar with theoretical linguistic issues . we will define phonology , morphology , syntax , language acquisition , and sociolinguistics , and discuss what each discipline is all about . this will give participants an opportunity to catch up with current , hot issues that conference presenters will be discussing . we will also briefly describe the presenters works , views and arguments and compare how each presenter s works are similar or different from others . the workshop will take place before the conference begins . it is designed to help you gain confidence and be able to participate effectively during the conference . please note that if you plan to participate in the pre-conference workshop , you must pre-register for the conference by october 9 . registration deadline : october 9 , 1998 . you must pre-register for this workshop . workshop fee : $ 30 conference registration for information related to registration and accommodations . college for continuing education attn : tislr ' 98 gallaudet university kellogg conference center 800 florida avenue , ne washington , dc 20002-3695 u . s . a .

sum : walloon,"several weeks ago i posted a passage in the local walloon of the bastogne area of belgium and asked for a translation . i had quite a number of responses , and it appears that the responders had a good time wrestling with the passage . here is the passage : i - gn-e ` a po ^ pre ` s kinze ans du d ' ci , dj ' asto amon albe ^ rt le ` yona ^ rd e ` t dj ' rawa ^ rdo pace k ' on m ' avot dit k ' ou profe ` sseu ^ r do se ' mine ^ re vlot nos ve ` y po pa ^ rler do walon . dju m ' sovin co k ' dj ' e ^ dmande ' a c , ' momint la : < < kin - a ^ dje k ' il e ` , don c , ' cure ' la ? > > dj ' e ^ vite avou compris k ' i n ' astot nin pus cure ' k ' mi , surtout cand dj ' l ' e ^ ve ` you avou oune be ` le djon . ne bwe ^ ce ` le ki n ' compurdot we ^ re lu walon , me ^ s k ' astot bin de ` cide ' a l ' aprinde avou de ` s profe ` sseu ^ rs come pierrot , come jeannot , come roger , ou come mi , di-st - i l ' fou . and here is the consensus translation : il y a a ` peu pre ` s quinze ans d ' ici , j ' e ' tais chez < < albert le ' onard > > et j ' attendais parce qu ' on m ' avait dit qu ' un professeur du se ' minaire voulait nous voir pour parler du wallon . je me souviens ce que j ' ai demande ' a ` ce moment-la ` : < < quel a ^ ge a-t - il donc , ce cure ' - la ` ? > > j ' avais vite compris qu ' il n ' e ' tais pas plus cure ' que moi , surtout quand je l ' ai vu avec une belle jeune demoiselle qui ne comprenait gue ` re le wallon , mais qui e ' tait bien de ' cide ' e a ` l ' apprendre avec des professeurs comme pierrot , comme jeannot , comme roger , ou comme moi , dit-il , le fou . there were some uncertainties and disagreements ; i ' ve gone with the majority view in each case . the biggest problem was the very last bit , which caused havoc , though the gist of it seems generally clear . there was some disagreement as to whether it was the non-priest or the young girl who wanted to learn walloon ; most people went for the woman , which is what the syntax appears to say . the strange form < rawa ^ rdo > in the second line appears to be the same word as french < regarder > , but i am told that , in northern dialects , this word is widely used in the sense of ` wait , wait for , watch for ' . another headache was the word < bwe ^ ce ` le > in line 6 . this clearly means something like < demoiselle > , and it is possibly the same word as french < pucelle > ` virgin , maiden ' , which is unlikely to be the sense intended . i am told that speakers of walloon are now generally elderly , apart from some younger people who are enthusiasts ( though the belgian student i consulted here told me she had a friend who spoke walloon ) . some younger people of limited education are also said to have a grasp of the variety , and , engagingly , i am told that obscenities and insults tend to persist especially well . one respondent objected to my speaking of walloon as a dialect of french , preferring to see it as a distinct language . here 's an english version : it 's fifteen years ago now ; i was at the "" albert leonard "" [ institute ] and i was curious because i had been told that a teacher from the seminary wanted to see us to talk about walloon . i still remember what i was wondering at that moment : "" so how old is that priest ? "" i quickly understood that he was no more a priest than i was , particularly when i saw him with a beautiful young girl who scarcely knew any walloon but who was determined to learn it from teachers like pierrot , like jannot , like roger , or like me ; that 's what he said , the fool . the passage was written by m . georges pasau , pre 's ident du muse ' e de la parole au pays de bastogne ; it appeared in issue 4 ( 1994 ) of the magazine _ singuliers _ , which is devoted to walloon . this was a special number given over to the publication of a new dictionary of walloon . the dictionary is michel francard ( 1994 ) , _ dictionnaire des parlers wallons du pays de bastogne _ , brussels : deboeck / universite ' , isbn 2-8041 - 1957 - 2 . francard is professor of romance linguistics at the university of louvain in belgium ; his address is faculte ' des lettres , universite ' catholique de louvain , louvain - le - nauve , belgium , and his e-mail is francard @ frwa . ucl . ac . be . i have n't consulted him yet , but plan to do so . the orthography used here for walloon was , i believe , invented by francard specifically for the dictionary . the dictionary contains some nice dialect maps and some linguistic information about walloon . my thanks to jean - francois carrasco , richard coates , jean - francois delannoy , roger feron , frederik fouvry , vincent granville , ted harding , yolande meessen , philippe mennecier , bernd moebius ( and his mother ! ) , joseph reisdoerfer , thierry j . van steenberghe , guido vanden wyngaerd , and max wheeler . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",0

case - marking in the genitive,"i ' m interested in languages with case-agreement in the genitive , i . e . languages where any case which the head might take must be copied on the dependent . these are pretty common in australia , e . g . uradhi ( g / is gamma ) : wutpu - : namu-mun g / antu-mun old-man - gen-abl canoe - abl "" from the old man 's canoe "" they ' re also found in the caucasus , in the languages of the ethiopian highlands , and in some siberian languages . all these only have suffixal genitival agreement . i have three questions : 1 . does anyone know of any languages outside these areas which have similar genitival agreement ? 2 . does anyone know of any languages which have prefixing genitival agreement ? 3 . does anyone know of any languages where all case-marking for the entire genitival phrase appears affixed solely on the dependent ?

re : 5 . 1370 can the comparative method be applied to syntax ?,"i would add to fritz newmeyer 's caveats about limitations to syntactic reconstruction these fairly obvious two : 1 . for many syntactic dimensions , the choices are so few that chance resemblances are so probable as to obscure the evidence of common ancestry . 2 . there is consideration non-arbitrariness in syntactic systems , so that , again , resemblance arises from other than common ancestry . larry gorbet lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu anthropology & linguistics depts .

( if you > do n't i ' ll say "" i thought not ! "" ) i suppose i ' m taking up benji 's gage , though i want it understood that i ' m very much in sympathy with what he has to say . i remember a little over 10 years ago i was taking a course in lexical phonology , and got into an argument with the prof . because he insisted that one of the co - rollaries of the theory was that ' people ' is inherently plural , which explained the non-existence of the overt plural ' peoples ' . i insisted that the word ' peoples ' certainly does exist and that therefore any theo - retical claim that it does n't was ipso facto falsified . ( cf . rev . vii 9 : ' a great multitude which no one could number , from every nation , from all tribes and * peoples * and languages ' . now , presumably ' people ' in this passage means something like ' ethnic group ' , and is not therefore precisely equivalent to ' people ' meaning ' many persons ' , or ' the set of all human beings ' . i would also note that one common meaning of ' universe ' is ' the set of all existing things ' , which would also imply that the word ' universes ' ought not to exist either , but it does . for one thing , there is a variant usage of ' universe ' which makes it roughly synonymous with ' galaxy ' or ' group of galaxies ' , of which of course there are many . it is also freely used in talking about ' parallel universes ' , etc . ) > from a paedagogical point of view i think it is perfectly legitimate for a linguistics teacher to say , ' here 's a bunch of strings , with attendant grammaticality judgments . what generalizations can we draw from these data ? ' we can save ourselves from the threat of the protest of a student who happens to be fluent in the language under discussion against a gram - maticality judgment by invoking the notion of ' idiolect ' and claiming ' these judgments are an accurate reflection of one particular individu - al 's own linguistic behaviour . what can we deduce about the internalized grammar of that individual ? ' this , of course , assumes that what we as linguists are concerned about is language as a psychological / cognitive phenomenon , and i believe that that is legitimate . but we are also , in my opinion legitimately , concerned about language as a social phenomenon . in which case language is not ( simply ) the property of an individual mind but of a community , and ' gram - maticality judgments ' may be different at the communal level from the individual level . i think as teachers we need to be honest with our stu - dents about this , which means allowing ourselves the luxury of a certain type or level of judgment on one occasion and a different one on another , but as much as possible each time making it clear to our students what level we ' re working at . addressing the broader issues that have come up following joseph stemberger 's posting in linguist 5-1163 , i think we also need to make clear the difference between ' grammaticality ' and ' acceptability ' judg - ments . i have an introductory lecture , prepared for a course i have as yet had no opportunity to teach , in which i attempt to explain that a given string ( e . g . , ' 3 is angry ' or ' my toothbrush is pregnant ' ) may be perfectly grammatical but semantically or pragmatically anomalous , and might be rejected for that reason , while another string ( e . g . , ' tooth - brush my am orange ' or ' there are a rabbit in garden ' ) may be fully in - terpretable and therefore not semantically anomalous but nevertheless violate certain constraints of grammar . i would be inclined to reject any claim that , as georgia green occasionally put it ( facetiously ) in class and elsewhere , ' the rules of grammar must include the rules of arithmetic and all other real-world knowledge ' . thus , if my son were to say , ' the moon is made of green cheese ' i might challenge him on the * content * of his statement , but not on its * con - struction * . dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *

obligatory affixes : summary,"several weeks ago i asked how the traditional notion of obligatory affixes was recast in the theory of realizational morphology . the responce was not exactly overwhelming , but i wish to thank greg stump ( eng101 @ ukcc . uky . edu ) , don ringe ( dringe @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu ) , r . beard ( rbeard @ coral . bucknell . edu ) , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy ( a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz ) for helpful responses . a few responses ( slightly edited ) : greg stump : in paradigm function theory , a language 's inventory of morphosyntactic features is assumed to determine - - for any major syntactic category x - - a paradigm schema : a set of cells each of which is associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to category x . in latin , for example , the features of case ( i . e . nominative , genitive , dative , accusative , ablative ) , number ( singular , plural ) , and gender ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) determine a paradigm schema for adjectives which consists of thirty cells , one for each of the case / number / gender combinations for which adjectives may be inflected . an adjective 's paradigm is then viewed as the inventory of inflected forms assigned to these cells . for any given cell c in the adjectival paradigm schema , there is a corresponding paradigm function which applies to an adjectival lexeme l to yield the inflected form of l assigned to c . paradigm functions are defined in terms of more specific morphological rules , including rules of exponence and rules of referral ; two or more of these may come into competition in the evaluation of a given paradigm function , in which case the narrower rule overrides the more general . how , then , is the notion of obligatory affixes recast in this theory ? notice first that the architecture of the theory guarantees that every inflected word w of category x will be associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to x , and that it is this set of specifications that drives the inflection of w . in other words , it is the morphology , not ( pace anderson ) the syntax , that ` ensures that any given word has all the features required by the affixes in question ' . ( naturally , i assume that a lexeme 's invariant feature specifications - - e . g . a noun 's gender - - are simply supplied by its lexical entry . ) second , if a particular affix position must be filled , then that position can be assumed to be associated with a set of rules of affixal exponence the least narrow of which functions as the default for that position . [ i have some questions about how that works where the choice of one affix seems to require the presence of morphosyntactic features which are otherwise absent , but it may be that all such examples could be reanalyzed . it would be unfair of me to say more until i ' ve had a chance to correspond with greg . - - mm ] [ some references : ] ` a paradigm-based theory of morphosemantic mismatches ' , _ language _ 67 ( 1991 ) , 675-725 . ` on the theoretical status of position class restrictions on inflectional affixes ' , in _ yearbook of morphology 1991 _ , ed . by geert booij and jaap van marle , 211-241 .

syntax,"nelson , diane carlita ; grammatical case assignment in finnish ; 0-8153 - 3180 - 0 , cloth ; pages , $ 65 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this study presents an analysis of patterns of morphological case in finnish within the principles and parameters framework . finnish has a rich system of inflection for both case and agreement , making it an important language for testing hypotheses about the relationships between morphological case and abstract case , and case / case and agreement . the focus of the study is a set of syntactic environments where internal dp arguments appear in nominative case , but alternate with accusative pronouns . in the same contexts , internal arguments may also receive partitive case to encode features related to aspect or indefiniteness . because these environments lack an external argument coindexed with agreement , the data is particularly relevant to predictions made by burzio 's generalization . by testing burzio 's hypothesis systematically against a range of sentence types , finnish is shown to contain an ergative case subsystem within a nominative-accusative main system . the assignment of the objective cases is linked with the licensing of aspectual roles at d - structure , and finite tense is posited as a bi-unique case assigner . the case split then arises as the result of two case features being assigned simultaneously to an internal argument , objective case at d - structure associated with aspect , and nominative case at s - structure associated with finite tense where an external argument is not available . morphological spell-out rules for particular argument types are proposed which determine the surface case realization of doubly-case assigned nominals . e - mail : info @ garland . com

just released ! 10 million ! ! !,"it was just released ! ! introducing . . . millions vol . 1a we took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the touted cd 's that are out there ( bought them all - some were $ 300 + ) ! we added the millions we had in storage to those . when we combined them all , we had in excess of 100 + million addresses in one huge file . we then ran a super "" sort / de-dupe "" program against this huge list . it cut the file down to less than 25 million ! ! ! can you believe that ? it seems that most people that are selling cd 's are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many program "" generated "" email addresses like compuserve , mci , anon 's , etc . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash , etc . we then ran a program that contained 1800 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . , etc . also eliminated all . edu , . mil , . org , . gov , etc . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 10 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd and otherwise . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and alot less time ! ! we also purchased cyber - promos ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber 's email addresses from top to bottom . we cleaned these , and came up with about 100 , 000 addresses . these are also mixed in . we also included a 6 + million "" remove / flamer "" file broke into seperate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes .

a linguist by any other name . . .,"given the current vigorous linguist vs linguistician debate , another potential title in the arena might not be terribly welcome , but at least it could , for a while , divert attention away from the existing debate which seems to be languishing ( i . e . getting nowhere ) . a friend of mine who is a medic suggested the nominalized form ' linguistic ' ( ' i am a linguistic ' ) , based on the model of medic / cleric . i suppose ' medic ' and ' cleric ' can occur as nominal forms on account of the derivational gap left by ' medical ' and ' clerical ' . however , ' linguistical ' has been cited , so perhaps we could shift everything across one derivation , thus allowing the sentence ' we linguistics enjoy linguistical questions ' . i hesitate to suggest ' linguisticine ' as the name of our subject . a r linn department of languages and linguisticine , u of luton

re : 3 . 427 innateness,"time for me to leap to the other side of the fence for a change . innateness does have a significance for linguistic theory itselt , if only in that the limitations of our inate abilities , mathematical , linguistic or what have you , limit the types of linguistic theories which can be plausibly constructed . processing of grammatical structures in real time is one example . of course , we know almost nothing about the capacity of human beings in this regard , which is slightly more or less than we know about universals of language , if any . < grin > . still , to the extent we have or can acquire information about our inate capacity for language ( assuming it to exist ) , it can help direct our energies in the proper direction . of course before we start talking about the limits of this capacity , we ought to have a clear picture of what sorts of linguistic phenomena are involved in spoken language , but that is the dreaded descriptivism again . . . eric schiller , department of linguistics , univ . of chicago",0

"symposium meaning , metaphor & religion","symposium announcement meaning , metaphor & religion : cognitive semantics and the bible the importance of a cognitive theory of meaning for the study of religious language university of leuven , 6 - 8 july 1998 aim of the meeting this symposium aims at determining how a cognitively inspired theory of meaning ( taken in the broad sense ) provides the study of religious language with new valuable insights . specifically , it will be investigated to what extent established and ongoing research into the semantics of bible texts is supported and / or questioned by the cognitive semantic paradigm . although this meeting is primarily conceived from a linguistic point of view , it is not meant for linguists alone . instead , it explicitly aims to bring together semantic expertise from both linguistics and theology in order to explore some of the possibilities and limitations of a combined study of religious language . where ? the symposium takes place in leuven ( b ) at the historical begijnhof site ( chievre house & faculty club ) program - ralph bisschops ( brussel / duisburg ) : "" metaphors disclosing new religious experiences : lover , bride and adulteress in hosea and ezekiel "" - lieven boeve ( leuven ) : "" linguistica ancilla theologiae : the interest of fundamental theology in cognitive linguistics "" - kristin de troyer ( breda / leuven ) : "" ' and god was created . . .

mt special issue on slt : reminder,"reminder - - deadline is july 1 1998 call for submissions machine translation special issue on spoken language translation guest editor : steven krauwer ( utrecht university ) guest editorial board : doug arnold ( university of essex ) pascale fung ( hkust , hong kong ) walter kasper ( dfki , saarbrucken ) alon lavie ( cmu , pittsburgh ) lori levin ( cmu , pittsburgh ) hermann ney ( rwth , aachen ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) some 15 years ago , when machine translation had become fashionable again in europe , few people would be prepared to consider seriously embarking upon spoken language translation research . after all , where both machine translation of written text , and speech understanding and production ( despite important achievements ) were still quite far from showing robustness in domain-independent applications , it seemed clear that putting three not even halfway understood technologies together would be premature , and bound to fail . since then , the world has changed . many researchers , both in academia and in industry , have taken up the challenge to build systems capable of translating spoken language . does that mean that most of the problems involved in speech-to - text , text-to - text translation , and text-to - speech have been solved ? the answer is no : although we have made a tremendous progress , both from a scientific and from a technological point of view , many of the fundamental problems in mt and in speech understanding remain unsolved . yet a certain degree of optimism is justified here . first of all , it is clear that on the whole general expectations of what mt will do are changing . where in the past the ultimate goal of mt seemed to be to provide a perfect , but cheaper and faster alternative to the human translator , there is now a clear shift from the ideal of fully automated high quality translation of unrestricted texts to the more practical problem of overcoming the language barriers we encounter in various situations . this shift of focus allows us to partition the problem we address into a series of smaller ones , the solution to which may be within our reach . this applies both to spoken and written language translation . if we look at spoken communication between human beings with different native languages , very often the main success criterion for this communication is not whether or not the individual utterances produced by the participants have been expressed or understood without errors ( which will rarely be the case ) , but rather whether the intended goal of the communication has been attained ( hotel room reservation , airline information , etc ) . this observation is extremely important when we try to set our goals for spoken translation systems . once we have realized that communication takes place in a specific context , with a specific goal , and have accepted that sentence-by - sentence linguistically correct translation is not a necessary condition for successful multilingual communication , we can start exploiting the full potential of spoken dialogues in human-human and human-machine interaction : the basic structure of dialogues , the ways to control dialogue flow , the possibility for repair . a workshop dedicated to spoken language translation , organized in conjunction with eacl / acl 1997 in madrid , showed that there was a keen interest in the topic , and that many acedemic and industrial research teams have interesting results to report . therefore we feel that the time has come to dedicate a special issue of the journal machine translation to this topic , and we are inviting high-quality , previously unpublished research papers addressing problems in the whole field of spoken language translation . ( note : authors who had papers accepted for the madrid workshop are especially encouraged to submit papers which have developed out of their workshop contributions , though they should note that we do not intend simply to reprint the workshop papers in their original form . ) we are especially interested in papers addressing problems or solutions that are typical for spoken language translation ( as opposed to written language translation ) . format for submission : please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header "" submission to coat speech special issue "" , or in hard-copy to either of the following addresses : machine translation editorial office , machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 , p . o . box 230 3300 az dordrecht , accord , ma 02018-023 the netherlands u . s . a . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor steven . krauwer @ let . ruu . nl or in hard-copy to steven krauwer , utrecht institute of linguistics ots , trans 10 , 3512 jk utrecht , the netherlands submission deadline : submissions and abstracts should be received by july 1 1998 . papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the editorial board . we are aiming for publication as issue 3 or 4 of volume 13 ( autumn or winter , 1998 ) .

"semantics ; a network theory of reference , kiyoshi ishikawa","a network theory of reference kiyoshi ishikawa ( hosei university ) noting specific inadequacies with truth-conditional approaches , ishikawa develops a dynamic theory of reference incorporating features of discourse representation theory , file change semantics and situation semantics , and also deals with non-monotonic belief revision . he argues that the task of natural language semantics is to describe meaning in terms of the psychological relation of language to our cognition of external reality . in his approach , a linguistic expression 's meaning is its potential to change the information state of a cognitive agent . reference is not understood as a link to a real individual external to an agent , but as the agent 's act to link a character in a linguistic frame of individuation to characters in other ( linguistic or nonlinguistic ) frames . as the target of inquiry , the distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions is analyzed through the construction of conversation scenarios . in addition , ishikawa extends his theory to an analysis of belief and attitude reports . application of the theory to cleft and pseudocleft constructions is also outlined . presented in a very accessible style , ishikawa 's theory will be of interest to scholars in cognitive science / artificial intelligence and philosophy as well as linguistics .

books and articles on cd-rom,"this text is also available in german ( see below ) dear linguist readers throughout the last years the working conditions of many scientists have been profoundly changed through the introduction of modern data processing technology . almost every workplace is being equipped with a computer which , after hours or even days of patiently getting acquainted with the working procedure of these tools , constitutes an enormous advantage . this advantage especially shows in the ever more efficient saving , processing , and transferring of data . thus , as early as today , most of the manuscripts of books , articles , diplomas , and master 's theses are being processed through word processing programmes and are eventually available as a computer file . besides word processing , both newer , more rapid processors and more efficient programmes also make possible an ever higher integration of images , image sequences and sound recordings into a written text . accordingly , a phonetic transcription of an experiment can contain , in addition to the text , not only a recording of the language but also photographs of the articulating organs , such as mouth and upper jaw . that allows the experiment to be followed much more easily and also to be conducted by other scientists from a different view point . in addition to saving how the research work is done , it is also possible to save the subject of the research on any kind of storage media . in order to archive the amount of data resulting from this particular combination of text , sound and images , the compact disc ( cd ) has come more and more into fashion as the perfect storage medium . today , many publications are already available on cd . besides the possibility of a multi-media presentation of knowledge , the cd has one more advantage : because of the low production costs of a cd and its huge storage capacity , more publications of scientists can be made available than is currently possible in journals and books . at this point , the possibility emerges for young scientists as well as for renowned ones to publish their works that have up to now tended to disappear in some drawer because of either the publishing costs or a "" not-a - chance "" notion . with this as a background , i would like to begin a survey to determine to what extent the linguists of all fields might have interest in the following questions : 1 . ) is multi-media technology commonly accepted ? do linguists prefer traditional print media , or is there any interest in accepting knowledge from the computer screen ? 2 . ) is there any interest in publishing works which contain not only text but also images and sound ? what ideas are there on how to publish these scientific works ? 3 . ) who has experience using cds in the field of linguistics ? this survey is intended to serve as a basis for developing a concept for a new enterprise in the media services sector , which should provide next year 's young linguistically oriented post-graduate students a platform from which to work independently . i would like to thank you in advance for your answers and ideas . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ liebe linguist leser , in den letzten jahren hat sich die arbeitswelt vieler wissenschaftler durch die einfuehrung moderner techniken der datenverarbeitung grundlegend geaendert . fast jeder arbeitsplatz ist mit einem computer ausgestattet , der nach einigen geduldigen stunden und tagen des kennenlernens der wirkungsweise dieser geraete , einen enormen arbeitsvorteil darstellt . dieser vorteil besteht insbesondere in der mehr und mehr komfortableren erfassung , verarbeitung und weitergabe von daten . so werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern , artikeln , diplom - und magisterarbeiten bereits heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich als eine datei vor . neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern , bildsequenzen und tonaufnahmen in eine niederschrift moeglich . so kann z . b . eine phonetische niederschrift ueber ein lautsprachliches experiment neben den schriftlichen ausfuehrungen auch die sprachaufnahmen enthalten , aber auch bildaufnahmen der artikulierenden organe , wie mund und unterkiefer ; damit ist dieses experiment besser nachvollziehbar und koennte unter anderen gesichtspunkten von dritten wissenschaftlern ebenfalls durchgefuehrt werden . es ist also moeglich , in vielen faellen neben den ausfuehrungen einer untersuchung , auch den untersuchungsgegenstand auf einen datentraeger zu speichern . um diese mengen an daten , die durch die kombination von text , bild und ton entstehen , zu archivieren , bewaehrt sich immer mehr die cd als speichermedium . viele veroeffentlichungen erscheinen schon heute auf cd . neben der moeglichkeit einer multi - media darstellung von wissen , hat die cd aber noch einen weiteren vorteil : aufgrund der niedrigen herstellungskosten einer cd und der riesigen menge an speicherplatz wird es moeglich , publikationen von mehr wissenschaftlern zu veroeffentlichen , als es mit herkoemmlichen journalen und buechern moeglich ist . hier ergibt sich fuer junge wissenschaftler , aber auch fuer renommierte die moeglichkeit , ihre niederschriften an die oeffentlichkeit zu bringen , die bisher , bedingt durch preis und ` chancenlosigkeit ' , eher in der schublade verschwanden . mit diesem hintergrund versehen , wuerde ich gern eine umfrage starten , inwieweit linguisten aller gebiete ein interesse an folgenden themen zeigen : 1 . ) gibt es eine allgemeine akzeptanz der multi - media technik . greifen linguisten lieber auf traditionell gedruckte literatur zurueck , oder besteht auch ein interesse an der wissensaufnahme durch den bildschirm . 2 . ) interessiert sich jemand fuer eine veroeffentlichung eigener arbeiten , die neben text auch bild und ton enthalten . welche vorstellungen gibt es ueber eine solche art und weise der publikation von wissenschaftlichen arbeiten . 3 . ) wer hat schon erfahrungen in der sprachwissenschaftlichen anwendung von cd 's gesammelt ? diese umfrage steht in dienst einer konzeptentwicklung fuer ein neues unternehmen im medien - dienstleistungsbereich , das fuer jungen , sprachwissenschaftlich orientierten studenten nach abschluss des studiums im naechsten jahr die basis fuer eine eigenstaendige arbeiten bilden soll . bereits im voraus bedanke ich mich fuer ihre antworten und anregungen . ingolf franke zeughausstrasse 31 d-54292 trier germany tel .

"review : watt , phonology of intonation .","watt , david l . e . 1994 . _ the phonology and semology of intonation in english : an instrumental and systemic perspective . _ bloomington : indiana university linguistics club publications . 192pp . paper . reviewed by karen steffen chung < karchung @ ccms . ntu . edu . tw > good books on intonation are not that easy to come by , in this reviewer 's opinion , but this should be considered one of them . it is not an introductory text that will take you through english intonation in a systematic way . and the book 's ostensible main thesis , which concerns the semantic interpretation of various intonation ' melodies ' , is not its primary attraction , either . what it offers is a solid collection of valuable observations , in bits and pieces , on english intonation . so i think that the best way to do justice to a book like this in a review is to simply pick out what i found to be some of the more interesting points and condense them here , without too much additional commentary . * * * * * * * * intonation as a subfield of linguistics is still wide open to pioneering work . the author describes intonation as one of the ' most puzzling and idiosyncratic ' aspects of human speech within the sphere of language as behavior , and he points out the role of intonation in the 'd ynamism of discourse ' ( from the preface ) . unlike another work in this series recently reviewed for linguist , taylor 's _ a phonetic model of intonation in english _ , this book focuses mainly on * language * as we speak and hear it , rather than on mechanical - and often difficult-to - interpret - computer models , though computer recorded and analyzed data is also used to help analyze stretches of speech in this study . watt concludes that since instrumentation is far from infallible , and the human ear can also be quite subjective in what it hears , the most reliable method is to use auditory impressions for the initial recording of data , and instrumentally collected data as a supplement . the book starts out with a useful introduction , in which terms are defined and goals set . the two sections of the main body stress the development of a phonological and semantic model of intonation , respectively . these are divided into two chapters each , entitled ( part i ) : "" the phonology of intonation "" , and "" tones in sequences "" ; and ( part ii ) : "" intonation and meaning "" , and "" the semantics of phonological gradience "" . two appendices of instrumental data from recorded speech consist of selected examples taken from halliday 's _ course in spoken english : intonation _ ( 1970 ) , and from a corpus compiled by the author . the book concludes with 14 pages of references . the data come from ' non-surreptitious ' but unmonitored , casual 'd iadic conversations ' between native speakers of ' educated standard toronto english ' - rather rare in a field where most of the works are based on british rp or standard us english . the author points out that the data are not intended to contrast with those taken from other varieties of english ; his main goal was to achieve consistency in the speech form used . among the power and distance parameters of social and personal relations , the author chooses for his data collection ' equal ' , over 's uperordinate ' and 's ubordinate ' ; ' acquainted ' , as opposed to ' intimate ' or ' foreign ' ; and ' face-to - face ' rather than 'd istance ' ( i . e . phone conversations , subject to various kinds of distortion , were excluded ) . intonation is a suprasegmental ( i . e . ' a feature whose domain extends over more than one segment ' ) feature of language , and the author adopts a _ prosodic _ ( ' the use of pitch contours to realize linguistic meaning ' ) approach in analyzing it . below follow some a few other terms as watt uses them in his study . _ tonality _ refers to the division of the message into phonological tone groups or ' information units ' ( iu ) . _ tonicity _ involves a process of locating the salient syllable in a tone group , the ' focal point of ideational meaning in the information unit ; each group must contain at least one tonic syllable , which is located at the onset of pitch movement associated with nuclear tone contour ' . _ tone _ refers to the selection of one of five simple or two compound tone contours that phonologically realize interpersonal meanings in the iu . particular tone choice can mediate speaker / hearer relations ( e . g . indicate the need for a response , change of turn , or continuation ) or mediate speaker-message relations : i . e . attitudes toward a message , such as reservation , certainty or assertion ( pp . 18-20 ) . also defined is _ paratone _ , a larger intonational unit , which cannot extend beyond a breath group ; and no larger intonational unit was found in this study . section one begins by proposing that a theory of intonation must strive to make two different kinds of descriptions , namely , ( 1 ) a phonological one , which emphasizes identification of nuclear tones and other refinements derived from instrumental analysis , and ( 2 ) a semantic description of the functional impetus responsible for motivating language behavior , which includes tone sequences , intertonal relations , paratones , and connected speech . section one concentrates on ( 1 ) . watt describes _ simple tones _ - namely ( 1 ) simple falling , ( 2 ) simple high rise ( with fall-rise option ) , and ( 3 ) low rise - and _ complex tones _ , which consist of more than one pitch movement and are naturally more complicated . these are : ( 4 ) , which occurs on the last two syllables of the final word of an utterance and reaches the top level of pitch , then falls sharply , and ( 5 ) , which consists of a rise-fall movement , with the intensity on the rise . there are also _ compound tones _ , i . e . combinations of simple tones fused into a single tone group . there are two compound tones , 1 + 3 , and 5 + 3 . watt notes that some researchers have proposed a model of intonational meaning similar to that of grammar , in which one compound tone is linked with one particular meaning or function . but intonation in fact does * not * function like this - intonation is a realization of * semantics * rather than syntax . the interpretation of intonation must be made within the context of grammar , but it is not linked element by element to the syntax . as g . brown ( only first initials are given in the references ) puts it : ' the phonological resources for signaling meaning are far fewer than the semantic functions which "" exploit "" them ' ( p . 73 ) . a notable pattern revealed by instrumental analysis of spoken data is _ downdrift _ , a declining of the fundamental frequency ( f0 ) over the span of short utterances for a wide range of languages . it oscillates between the two extremes of an equally descending and slightly narrowing bandwidth with sentence final fall and slight prolongation at the breath group boundary . the declination slope is not always constant , but it can be a series of descending plateaux , or sets of declination lines . this model is not as 's usceptible ' to errors of data interpretation as following individual nuclear tones can be ( pp . 66-71 ) . section two concentrates on developing a semantic model of intonation , i . e . providing an initial account of meaning often attributed to intonation . watt here advances his view that intonational meaning can be derived both from phonological contrasts of tone and tonicity and from the phonetic gradience characteristic of these contrasts . there is less consistency in generalizing the meaning of intonation than with a phonological description of sound substance due to ( 1 ) the nature of intonation and ( 2 ) the variety of inferences people draw from voice-related cues . as members of a speech community , we make inferences about what is meant both by what is said and how it is said . we must draw conclusions on discrete meanings from only * part * of the speech continuum ( and not include e . g . physical appearance of the speaker in our analysis ) . to deal with the semantics of intonation , you can take either a linguistic approach , in which you look at meaning * contrasts * and form-to - function correspondences , or you can take a psychological approach , in which ' polar clines ' are posited , e . g . bored vs . interested , or timid vs . confident ; watt addresses only the * linguistic * contribution of ' tonicity ' and ' tone ' ( p . 76 ff . ) . watt refers to halliday , who stresses the ideation function of intonation , how it highlights information for specific attention , i . e . given vs . new , also fresh vs . contrasted . the stressing of new information is an outcome of 's peaker assessed importance ' . the tonic of unmarked utterances will tend to fall on the last lexical item of the tone group ; this results in a broad , ' unspecified ' focus ; this focus is narrowed in a ' contrastive ' utterance ( p . 79 ) . intonation has an ' interpersonal metafunction ' by serving as a channel for linguistic expression of * attitude * , though it is not the only such channel . other channels include register and lexicon ; and sometimes certain stylistic effects can be achieved by combining incongruous linguistic content and intonations , e . g . imagine ' put that goddam pipe away ! ' uttered in a smiling , gentle tone of voice . so the listener 's perception of the speaker 's attitude may be based on two or more signals combined ( p . 87 ) . intonation adds information to disambiguate speech function . speech function is identified and interpreted through the cumulative effect of contextual , morpho-syntactic and phonological cues ( p . 91 ) . it can include competition for turns ( an initiating peak can be used for this ) , initiating a topic ( marked by an initial peak of intensity and high pitch ) , continuing ( upward drift ) , responding ( the second speaker approximates the relative pitch height of the baseline of the last utterance produced by the previous speaker , i . e . an accommodation of one speaker 's melodic pattern to that of another ) , terminating ( fall to the lowest level of the speaker 's voice range ; a termination often falls well above the baseline before its final fall ) , checking function ( conversation monitoring with sporadic checks on the status of the conversation , i . e . checking that the hearer understands , agrees on the appropriateness of what is being expressed , and is still engaged ; this is intended to elicit a response from the hearer , but usually involves no change of turn , e . g . ' is n't it ? ' , ' right ? ' , ' you know ' , ' eh ' ) , certainty ( speakers can indicate ' certainty known / absolute ' , ' certainty irrelevant / conditional ' , or ' certainty unknown / assumed ' ) . watt points out that a major difficulty of doing description of intonation is the inherently gradient characteristic of the spoken medium . there is a gradient between the linguistic and the paralinguistic , as well as a division between what constitutes a linguistic contrast and what signals a modification of the phonological cline within that contrast . watt offers a revealing quote from bolinger : ' the higher the rise , the greater the exasperation if it is a statement , the greater the surprise of curiosity if it is a question . the lower the fall the greater the certainty or finality if the utterance is a statement , and the greater the confidence if it is a question ' [ 1986 : 240 ] . that is , in watt 's own words : ' . . . the greater the degree of the rise , or the height of a given contour , the greater the strength of the contextual meaning assumed for that contour ' ( p . 109 ) . watt sums his work up nicely - and what he says could easily be applied to just about any worthy field of inquiry - in the final chapter thus : ' there is a certain fractal logic that seems to pervade the investigation of intonation . the more we magnify the field under scrutiny , in the hopes of reaching an explanation of its details , the more we find new and unexpected details in need of explanation . the deeper we probe into the next level of detail , the more difficult it becomes to extricate ourselves from its detail with a parsimonious description of the new possibilities ' ( p . 121 ) . in addition to recapping the highlights of his book in the conclusion , watt offers his vision for what his work has to contribute to the field in general , namely , a ' compatible point of departure from which to further the description of discourse ' ( p . 122 ) . he believes that accurate synthesizing of intonations may possibly add to our knowledge about our auditory perceptions , and that can also help further develop our models of synthesized speech . * * * * * * * * although the book 's basic structure is clearly set out in the section and chapter titles , the contents of each subdivision are diverse and often hard to incorporate into a coherent , linear narrative on intonation ; one must content oneself with the fragments one is able to latch onto . yet one has the feeling that much is being said in this motley collection of ideas , observations , and analyses , much more than in many other of the works on intonation available . and for this reason , the interested reader is advised to bear with the author , take notes , and enjoy the ride . this book has a rather amateurish , low-budget look , perhaps to be expected from university publications of this kind . the instrumental graphs bordered by thick black outlines and incorporated into the chapters in many places seem stuffed in a little too close to the written text , though there is no problem of clarity . the text itself is set in a relatively large serif typeface , which makes for comfortable reading , though occasionally some startlingly inconsistent type sizes turn up . new concepts ( e . g . _ paratone _ , _ concord _ ) appear in bold and are easily spotted . minor typos appear here and there . the diy look of the design is not a serious flaw , though , for anyone after unalloyed content , of which you get plenty in this book . overall , this is a worthwhile and rather refreshing book for someone seriously interested in intonation . the reader had better be ready , however , to invest a bit of work to mine it of its wealth . reviewed by karen steffen chung , department of foreign languages and literatures , national taiwan university , taipei .",0

verlag as volume 862 of the lectures notes in artificial intelligence , and the third international colloquium on grammatical inference , held at montpellier in france , the proceedings of which were published by springer - verlag as volume 1147 of the lecture notes in artificial intelligence . following the success of these events and the workshop on automata induction , grammatical inference , and language acquisition , held in conjunction with the international conference on machine learning at nashville in united states in july 1997 , the fourth international colloquium on grammatical inference will be held from july 12 through july 14 , 1998 , at iowa state university in united states . -

new uci dissertations in linguistics,"irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following two uci dissertations in linguistics . feature attraction and category movement brian k . agbayani university of california , irvine , 1998 this dissertation presents a new theory of movement in generative grammar within the framework of the minimalist program ( chomsky 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) . the most important aspect of the new theory is that it departs from the standard view of move a as a unitary operation . the dissertation has three main goals . the first goal is to simplify the theory of feature checking in such a way that a single structural configuration ( namely , the head-adjunction structure ) holds for feature checking in both overt and covert syntax . the second goal is to present evidence for the split movement hypothesis , according to which a set of formal features and its associated category move to separate structural positions in syntax . the claim is that ug makes both attract and move available in the form of attract f and category movement , respectively . the former satisfies the formal requirement of feature checking , and the latter yields the phonological "" displacement "" effect of overt movement . the theory thus abandons the treatment of move a as a unitary operation . the third goal is to explore consequences for the proper characterization of locality in syntax . the split movement approach opens up a novel way to account for the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effects ( huang 1982a ) that do not fall under chomsky 's ( 1995 ) attract f theory . it is argued that attract f and category movement are subject to different types of economy conditions , and that the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effects should not be given a unified account , contrary to the barriers approach ( chomsky 1986a ) . the theory also derives a number of previously mysterious properties related to cross linguistic variation in extractability out of islands , the relative strength of island effects , and the nature of successive-cyclic movement . this dissertation presents a new approach to movement in syntax which overcomes the conceptual and empirical shortcomings of the traditional approach , while gaining new insights into previously mysterious phenomena and properties of natural languages . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : parametrization of features in syntax sze - wing tang university of california , irvine , 1998 the major focus of this study is to propose a restrictive theory of parameters of universal grammar in terms of the principles-and - parameters approach . i propose that semantic features are invariant across languages ; only features that may play a role in the derivation from n to the pf interface level including phonetic features , categorial features , and affix features are subject to parametric variation , which is called the ' overt parametrization hypothesis ' ( oph ) . it is argued that where affix features are associated with a word is subject to parametric variation . movement is largely determined by morphology : movement in the overt component can be signaled by ' impoverished ' morphology ; movement of morphologically ' rich ' elements takes place in the phonological component . under this approach , a variety of syntactic differences among chinese ( cantonese and mandarin ) , english , french , japanese , navajo , and hebrew can be accounted for . based on the idea of parametrization of affix features , i claim that t has an affix feature [ - v ] in english . such an affix feature is missing in chinese . consequently , there is no v - to - t movement in chinese and v moves out of vp in english . a number of apparently disparate differences between these two languages , including postverbal no-phrases , the distribution of focus elements , binominal each , the ' sov ' focalization construction , scopal ambiguity of quantifiers , definiteness of preverbal numeral phrases , gapping , and heavy np shift , receive a unified explanation . the data presented as evidence for the claim that categorial features are subject to parametric variation are primarily based on small clauses in chinese , english , and japanese . it is argued that chinese small clauses are bare , english small clauses are ' not-so - bare ' , and japanese allows both types of small clauses . the major typological differences among these languages regarding the structure of small clauses are derived from a parameter related to the combination of categorial features of nouns and adjectives . the findings lend support to the oph . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : also available : > uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement ikawa , hajime 1996 overt movement as a reflex of morphology ishii , toru 1997 an asymmetry in the composition of phrase structure and its consequences li , xiaoguang 1997 deriving distributivity in mandarin chinese takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : "" partial "" wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the "" crossing "" constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : scrambling and partial object shift kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani > and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 4 ;

phonemicity of writing,"i would like to get some estimate of what percentage of the world 's written languages are represented orthographically in a phonemic manner . more specifically , how many written languages are such that one can predict the phonological properties of a word - - - including stress , accent or tone - - - merely by consulting the string of symbols used to write that word , and without further information , such as the morphological structure of the word ? for a language whose writing system is largely phonemic , one could write down a set of rules for word pronunciation , and in the ideal case the number of rules would be within an order of magnitude of the number of graphemes . ( a few lexical exceptions do n't matter , as long as there are n't hundreds of them . ) i am leaving the sense of ` phoneme ' intentionally vague : normally a phonemic written representation implies that one can predict the surface phonemic representation from the written form of the word , but i would be perfectly happy considering a system to be phonemic if some more abstract level of phonological representation were represented , from which the surface phonemic representation could be predicted by regular phonological rules / principles . ( i should also note , to clarify the question further , that i am interested primarily in the correspondence between the written form and the spoken form for the the standard variet ( y , ies ) of the language , which the written form presumably reflects to some degree : i am not interested ( at the moment ) in dialects of the language which deviate to varying degrees from the standard . ) so , under this definition , spanish would presumably count as very phonemic since one can nearly always predict the pronunciation of a word , including its stress , from the orthography . romanian is less phonemic since while the actual set of phonemes in a word is mostly determinable by the set of graphemes used ( with the representation of glides being slight source of complication ) , the placement of stress requires some knowledge of the morphological class of the word ( following work of ioana chitoran ) . english is presumably among the least phonemic , since the ` regular rules ' of pronunciation are themselves quite complex , and there are many lexical exceptions . the particular classification of the writing system as logographic , moraic or segmental is unimportant : in principle chinese writing could be classed as phonemic ( albeit with a rather large set of graphemes ) , but for the fact that especially among the more common characters there are quite a few with pronunciation ambiguities which can only be resolved using lexical information . i am familiar with several of the recent books on writing systems : but while these typically contain in-depth analyses of particular systems , as far as i can tell , nobody has done a survey of this kind . ( if on the contrary , someone can point me to a survey that answers this question , i would be most grateful . ) so , i would be very interested in getting as much information related to this question on as many languages as people are sufficiently familiar with . i think i already know the answer to these questions for the more familiar western european languages ( including some less familiar ones like irish and welsh ) , as well as romanian , russian , hebrew , arabic , chinese , japanese and malagasy . i would be particularly interested in knowing about languages for which writing systems have only recently been developed , or for which the spelling system has recently undergone a massive restructuring : conventional wisdom has it that in such cases the writing system should be very phonemic , but perhaps that is not always true . please send any replies to me , and if there are a sufficient number i will post the results of this survey to the list . - richard sproat linguistics research department at&t bell laboratories | tel ( 908 ) 582-5296 600 mountain avenue , room 2d - 451 | fax ( 908 ) 582-7308 murray hill , nj 07974 , usa | rws @ research . att . com

acl / coling workshop on translingual information management,"! ! ! ! submission deadline march 23 ! ! ! ! coling-acl998 workshop on translingual information management current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 ( following acl / coling-98 ) university of montreal , montreal ( quebec , canada ) call for papers description - - - - - - - - - - the development of natural language applications which handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? this workshop is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts will consider these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on acl workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational inguistics community as a whole . the workshop will include ample time for discussion . a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the acl workshop . topics - - - - - the workshop will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics - based ) of pre-parsing , parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . we invite submissions which report on work in these areas . all papers should clearly identify how the work addresses the issues and questions outlined above . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only hard-copy submissions will be accepted . authors should submit six ( 6 ) copies of the full-length paper ( 3500-5000 words ) . submissions should be sent to : nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa style files and templates for preparing submissions can be found at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : march 23 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 scientific committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - charles fillmore university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy information sciences institute , usa nancy ide vassar college , usa lauri karttunen ( tentative ) rank xerox research , france kimmo koskenniemi university of helsinki , finland mun kew leong national university of singapore joseph mariani limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura nec , japan martha palmer university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky brandeis university , usa peter schaueble eth , switzerland oliviero stock irst , italy felisa verdejo uned , spain piek vossen university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster dfki , germany organizers - - - - - - - - - robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa eduard hovy , isi , university of southern california , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa information - - - - - - - - - - information on the workshop can be found at http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / translingual . html inquiries may be addressed to the organizers : robert frederking < ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu > eduard hovy < hovy @ isi . edu > nancy ide < ide @ cs . vassar . edu >",0

2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to "" try before you buy "" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum

case studies needed,"dear colleagues , i ' m preparing to teach an introductory course in language variation , and i 'd like to get your help ( again ) . could you recommend any case studies , either from published sources or from your own experience , that would be appropriate for class discussion ? what i ' m looking for in a case study is a description of a real situation , preferably a somewhat controversial one . ideally , it would include some background information , a description of the conflicts involved , the sequence of events up to a point where a decision is needed , and a description of the actual decision taken . since the course is on language variation , relevant case studies would include anecdotes on discrimination in the workplace or in the educational system because of language choice or dialect choice , or cases involving difficult decisions in language planning or language legislation . i ' ve never used case studies before , so advice and comments are also welcome ! my address is mkuha @ silver . ucs . indiana . edu thanks for your help . mai kuha

a theory of predicates,"a theory of predicates ackerman , farrell ( university of california , san diego ) and webelhuth , gert ( university of north carolina , chapel hill ) ; a theory of predicates ; isbn : 1-57586 - 087 - 2 ( cloth ) , 1-57586 - 086 - 4 ( paper ) ; 402 pp . csli publications 1998 : http : / / csli-www . stanford . edu / publications / email : pubs @ roslin . stanford . edu in this work two linguists from different theoretical paradigms develop a new general theory of natural language predicates . this theory is capable of addressing a broad range of issues concerning ( complex ) predicates , many of which remain unresolved in previous theoretical proposals . grounded in empirical evidence from a wide variety of genetically and geographically unrelated languages ( german , hungarian , fox , nenets , tzotzil , malayalam , among others ) , this new theory synthesizes conceptual and representational assumptions from several different theoretical traditions . the authors focus on cross-linguistically recurring patterns of predicate formation where identical contentive notions ( i . e . , lexical semantic , grammatical function , and morphosyntactic information ) are expressed by predicates consisting of a single morphological word or by combinations of independent words that need not form a single syntactic unit . they provide a detailed implementation of their theory for german tense-aspect , passive , causative , and verb-particle predicates . in addition , the authors discuss extensions of these representative analyses to the same predicate constructions in other languages . beyond providing a formalism for the analysis of language-particular predicates , they demonstrate how the basic theoretical mechanisms they develop can be employed to explain universal tendencies of predicate formation . for this purpose , ackerman and webelhuth introduce the construct ` grammatical archetype ' into linguistic theory , relating universal patterns of predicate formation to language-particular patterns in a principled fashion . this book will be of interest to linguists and grammarians from any generative , cognitive / functional , or traditional perspective . in addition , it is accessible to interested philosophers , psycholinguists , cognitive scientists , computational linguists , anthropological linguists , and philologists . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * csli publications ventura hall stanford university stanford , ca 94305-4115 telephone ( 650 ) 723-1839 fax ( 650 ) 725-2166 http : / / csli-www . stanford . edu / publications

feminine he,"feminine he ouch ! no doubt about it , pronouns and gender are touchy topics . robert millar ( in metaphorically slapping me around a little in the ad hominem mode ) makes some good points but mistakes my focus a bit , misspeaks my findings somewhat , and misstates the fuller design of my position a lot . his linguistic list vol-6 - 835 ( 22 jun 1995 ) responds to my vol-6 - 806 ( 12 jun 1995 ) . i don ' t mean to say that , as robert millar attributes , "" 's he ' entered english as a whole suddenly at the advent of printing "" - - puhleeeze . i do mean to say that the h - stem feminine suddenly , after printing begins , disappears forever from the written record . my broader conclusion is that the h - stem feminine was alive for centuries beyond the oed 's orthodox-view account of its purported demise . i don ' t discount the sh - forms during the periods when and in the regions where they are amply attested . far be it . i do , however , maintain that the "" significant "" cause , in the overview , for the disappearance of the h - stem feminine was , not that it began to resemble phonetically the masculine , but rather the standardizing force of printing ( the motive for this is a separate question ) . and , too , there is the telling evidence that spoken pronoun use is often quite different from written . and i am suggesting that some of the oe h - stems survived in speech beyond printing 's seeming signal of their demise . the late survival of the h - stem feminine has the implication for socio / political linguistics that 18th century grammarians , regarded during these past decades as androcentric ( for having written down the "" he rule "" ) must be admitted to not have been so - - "" he "" is the principal thrust of the androcentric argument , right ? i am tempted to apologize for my insensitivity to other people 's faculty for correctness . in this case , it resulted in robert millar suffering mood swings - - feelings he shared with us - - his sorrow , his anger , regarding my position . my intention was not to academically abuse or linguistically victimize anybody . but despite his mood swings , we may all nonetheless benefit from his hot flashes of insight appropriate to his rejoinder to my native morphology of singular "" they "" hypothesis . but i will not continue the "" they "" discussion here , however , so 's not to detract from the late survival of the h - stem feminine presently under discussion , and indeed much more the hot topic . robert millar says that he suspects that i only have a slight understanding of dialect diversity , and that my discussing material from _ piers plowman _ and _ ayenbite of inwyt _ is a way to "" circumvent . . . lalme , mcintosh and samuels . "" first i would suggest that he provide fuller citations , this for the benefit of those on the list who concentrate in other areas of linguistics than this subject ; and second i would like to make available to him and anybody else some of my charts resulting from my indexing and sorting all the citations for all the forms for all the third person pronouns in the oed . m . l . samuals , "" dialects and grammar , "" in _ a companion to piers plowman _ ( ed . , john a . alfred , 1988 ) , specifically identifies by dialect nine of the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of _ piers plowman _ . these are the ones that had already been identified in kane - donaldson , 1960 ( _ piers plowman , the a - version _ , george kane ) , after generations of effort . the book is a momentous compendium that in my thinking was conceived with the intention of making work such as mine possible . i use the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of _ piers _ as the mainstay of my argument . samuals is unable to identify the dialects in nearly half the manuscripts of piers . i specifically focus on _ piers _ because it is a manageable corpus that anyone can go and check for themselves . _ piers _ is a great source for studying diverse forms because the forms are all variations on the same text . where can one find such a wealth of data for comparative analysis ? and piers can also be considered the first highly "" popular "" work in medieval english , and for this reason , the scribes , in copying the work for their intended audiences , would tend to avoid esoteric , literary , and archaic forms . the "" cult of auctoritas "" is the conservative emulation of older forms by the copying scribe . robert millar alludes to this to explain the h - stem feminines found in manuscripts of _ piers _ . i have met with this criticism before . i will make available to anyone who wants them particular lines as found in all seventeen manuscripts , and rather than the conservation of forms , the contrary of the auctoritas principle seems to be found in _ piers _ , whereby the scribes , in copying from the original , tended to modify it to regional conventions . i am not saying that auctoritas was not in many instances of medieval scribal practice the rule . i ' m saying that looking at lines of _ piers _ , through the seventeen manuscripts , sees in them a tremendous diversity . and even so , the use of the h - stems in all the manuscripts - - assuming for the sake of argument they were not in colloquial use - - indicates that they were well known , nonetheless , does n't it ? robert millar reads between my lines that i consider the anglo - normans as "" wicked . "" not so . chronocentrism in the reading of history is as inimical to reason and human understanding as is ethnocentrism in the reading of culture . he holds to the orthodox view and says that "" the rising london standard spread much more rapidly than it ever would have done in an age of purely manuscript culture . "" but would n't the london "" standard "" better be called the status dialect . it is mistaken to assume that writing , before and after printing , reflected how people generally used language day-to - day . most people talk like _ i love lucy _ and _ the honeymooners _ , not like _ the new york times _ . today , for example , the indefinite / proverbial "" he "" is primarily a written status form ; the singular "" they "" a spoken form . i think it is very safe to assume that then , just as now , there is a common english and a status english within a particular regional dialect . it is on the basis of this assumption , coupled with evidence for the widespread knowledge of the h - stem feminine in the generations before printing , that i am postulating the late survival of the h - stem feminine . anybody who would like to have my charts showing the "" persistence "" of all the feminine and masculine h - stem forms from the 11th century on , comparative exhibits of lines through the seventeen manuscripts of _ piers _ , pronoun paradigms from the same manuscripts , and perhaps a few other items - - they are available for a dollar copy charge and two stamps for usa . jeffrey weber , 2843 n . spaulding ave . , chicago , illinois , 60618 , usa . this current transmission is more an aside than the summary that will be forthcoming . i have received an excellent critique from wittysan ( sean ) , which he sent also to robert millar , and would be happy for the asking to share it and my response as this inquiry continues .

""" english plus "" resolution in congress","the "" english - plus "" resolution below was introduced into the house of representative on july 13 by rep . jose serrano ( d - n . y . ) , along with 31 other democratic cosponsors and one republican , ileana ros - lehtinen ( fla . ) . it is a nonbinding statement of policy intended as counter to six english - only bills now pending in congress . ( these measures include the king bill , h . r . 1005 , which would declare english the official language , end bilingual education and bilingual ballots , and require all government business to be transacted in english ; and the only slightly less restrictive emerson bill , h . r . 123 , which likewise declares english the official language and ends all federal funding for bilingual education . the emerson bill has more than 120 sponsors and is held to be likely to pass this year ; hearings will probably be scheduled once the present conflicts over the budget are resolved . ) some opponents of english - only measures have felt that the wording of this resolution is not as strong as they would like , particularly as it makes only indirect reference to bilingual education programs . still , its passage would have an important symbolic effect , and even if it should be defeated in committee , it will at least help to draw the battle lines over this issue . the lsa executive committee voted at its meeting this may to give its support to this resolution ; and in a mail ballot a few years ago the membership of the society declared its opposition to english - only measures by a margin of 94 to 6 percent . individual linguists may want to make their views on the english - plus resolution known to members of the house committee on economic and educational opportunities , whose names follow the text of the resolution below . committee members can be reached at : the honorable _ _ _ _ _ _ _ u . s . house of representatives washington , dc 20515 geoff nunberg concurrent resolution entitled , the ` ` english plus resolution ' ' . whereas english is the primary language of the united states , and all members of the society recognize the importance of english to national life and individual accomplishment ; whereas many residents of the united states speak native languages other than english , including many languages indigenous to this country , and these linguistic resources should be conserved and developed ; whereas this nation was founded on a commitment to democratic principles , and not on racial , ethnic , or religious homogeneity , and has drawn strength from a diversity of languages and cultures and from a respect for individual liberties ; whereas multilingualism , or the ability to speak languages in addition to english , is a tremendous resource to the united states because such ability enhances american competitiveness in global markets by permitting improved communication and cross-cultural understanding between producers and suppliers , vendors and clients , retailers and consumers ; whereas multilingualism improves united states diplomatic efforts by fostering enhanced communication and greater understanding between nations ; whereas multilingualism has historically been an essential element of national security , including the use of native american languages in the development of coded communications during world war ii , the korean war , and the vietnam war ; whereas multilingualism promotes greater cross-cultural understanding between different racial and ethnic groups in the united states ; whereas there is no threat to the status of english in the united states , a language that is spoken by 94 percent of united states residents , according to the 1990 united states census , and there is no need to designate any official united states language or to adopt similar restrictionist legislation ; whereas ` ` english - only ' ' measures , or proposals to designate english as the sole official language of the united states , would violate traditions of cultural pluralism , divide communities along ethnic lines , jeopardize the provision of law enforcement , public health , education , and other vital services to those whose english is limited , impair government efficiency , and undercut the national interest by hindering language skills needed to enhance international competitiveness and conduct diplomacy ; and whereas such ` ` english - only ' ' measures would represent an unwarranted federal regulation of self-expression , abrogate constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection of the laws , violate international human rights treaties to which the united states is a signatory , and contradict the spirit of the 1923 supreme court case meyer v . nebraska , wherein the court declared that ` ` the protection of the constitution extends to all ; to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with english on the tongue ' ' ; now , therefore , be it resolved by the house of representatives ( the senate concurring ) , that the united states government should pursue policies that - - ( 1 ) encourage all residents of this country to become fully proficient in english by expanding educational opportunities ; ( 2 ) conserve and develop the nation 's linguistic resources by encouraging all residents of this country to learn or maintain skills in a language other than english ; ( 3 ) assist native americans , native alaskans , native hawaiians , and other peoples indigenous to the united states , in their efforts to prevent the extinction of their languages and cultures ; ( 4 ) continue to provide services in languages other than english as needed to facilitate access to essential functions of government , promote public health and safety , ensure due process , promote equal educational opportunity , and protect fundamental rights ; and ( 5 ) recognize the importance of multilingualism to vital american interests and individual rights , and oppose ` ` english - only ' ' measures and similar language restrictionist measures . house committee on economic and educational opportunities republicans democrats william f . goodling ( pa ) , chmn . william "" bill "" clay ( mo ) thomas e . petri ( wi ) george e . miller ( ca ) marge s . roukema ( nj ) dale e . kildee ( mi ) steven gunderson ( wi ) pat williams ( mt ) harris w . fawell ( il ) matthew g . martinez ( ca ) cass ballenger ( nc ) major r . owens ( ny ) bill barrett ( ne ) thomas g . sawyer ( oh ) randy cunningham ( ca ) donald m . payne ( nj ) peter hoekstra ( mi ) patsy t . mink ( hi ) howard mckeon ( ca ) robert e . andrews ( nj ) michael castle ( de ) john f .

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately

effects of morphological case - - utrecht univ,"second call for papers effects of morphological case workshop to be held at the utrecht institute of linguistics ots , utrecht university , 28-29 august 1998 . organizers : helen de hoop , olaf koeneman , iris mulders , and fred weerman invited speakers : paul kiparsky , joan maling , alec marantz the aim of this workshop is to investigate the effects of morphological case that go beyond its mere phonological characteristics . in the gb model of the eighties , morphological case was considered a spell-out of abstract case . while abstract case is present in all languages , the spell-out is only in a subset . in such a view , the presence of morphological case may help to uncover more abstract features , but in itself it does not have syntactic or semantic effects . this runs counter to observations that the presence / absence of morphological case correlates with the presence / absence of certain syntactic and semantic properties . a case in point is the more or less classical observation that the presence of morphological case is related to the possibility for several types of scrambling . other approaches have been proposed to incorporate ( some of ) these effects of morphological case and the idea that parametric differences should be reducable to morphological properties has been defended with varying success . against this background , the present workshop seeks answers for questions like the following : what is the relation between morphological case and abstract case ? what are the distributional , interpretive and phonological effects of the presence of morphological case ? the aim of this workshop is to bring together theoretical and empirical considerations on the effects of morphological case . issues for discussion involve the implications of morphological case for abstract case theory , the difference between structural and inherent case , agreement , word order phenomena , grammaticalization processes , discourse theory , and semantics . we welcome contributions relating to all aspects of linguistics . in particular we are interested in comparative , diachronic and acquisitional evidence that shows that relations between morphological case and other aspects of the grammar do ( not ) exist . the program will include three invited lectures of experts on the topic of morphological case . the provisional titles are as follows : paul kiparsky ( stanford ) : ` cases as complementizers ' joan maling ( brandeis ) : ` morphological case is not ( always ) to blame ! ' alec marantz ( mit ) : ` in defense of "" spell-out "" : why morphological case should indeed have only an indirect reflective relation to the syntax ' the workshop has room for 13 selected talks of 35 minutes . authors should submit 5 copies of an anonymous abstract of no more than 2 pages , one camera-ready copy indicating the author 's name and a 3x5 "" card with the author 's name , address , affiliation , e-mail address , phone number , and the title of the paper . we hope to be able to ( partially ) reimburse all speakers . please send your abstracts to : workshop on morphological case utrecht institute of linguistics ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht the netherlands the deadline for submission is april 1 , 1998 . authors will be notified of acceptance by may 15 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * olaf koeneman * * utrecht institute of linguistics ots * * trans 10 ( room 2 . 20 ) , 3512 jk utrecht * * tel . + 31 30 253 8304 * * email : koeneman @ let . ruu . nl * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

save money on your phone bill,"i hope you do n't object to a complete stranger mailing you this , but i believe this to be an opportunity too good to be missed by anyone . i ' m looking forward to saving money on my phone bill and so can you : - to save money on your phone bill please read this message carefully tcw telecoms direct ltd least cost routing gives you the opportunity to save money on all of your phone bills all of the time . how much will you save ? local calls 15 % regional calls 30 % national calls 30 % international calls 30 % landline to mobile 10 % ( discounts shown are against bt standard rates . rates track bt on a daily basis , for pricing information see bt ) now here comes the best bit - you can save even more every month by referring friends . simply tell your friends about the tcw lcr service . give them your customer number ( located on the top left of your contract when you have become a customer ) ( call 01235 442350 and quote account number de / 184374 to become a customer yourself ) ask your friends to call tcw telecoms direct ltd on 01235 442350 . let tcw telecoms direct ltd do the rest . how will tcw thank you ? you ' ll receive credits for every month that your recommended friends continue to use the tcw service . every month there will be a loyalty referral discount on your bill . the more friends you refer , the greater your monthly credit will become - and yes - this credit is every month . so become a tcw customer now and then call your friends . in time , your phone bill from tcw telecoms direct could read zero ! how do you become a tcw customer ? call tcw telecoms direct ltd on 01235 442350 now and give them the account number de / 184374 - you , me and your friends will soon be saving money on your phone bills - even more so if you all recommend the service to others . good luck and here 's to smaller phone bills for everyone ! ! more details follow for those wishing to know more about how this service works if you are already receiving discounts from bt or your cable operator , you may not see the benefit of using the tcw service as the discounts above may not seem attractive . however , remember that by recommending friends your resultant discounts over bt standard rates could become 100 % every month due to the referral credits appearing on your tcw bill . in other words , by recommending friends you can reduce your tcw bill to zero over time . i have just asked tcw / telecoms direct customer service what happens to calls to numbers such as 0845 that get used for internet access , and apparently these are discounted the same as local calls , i . e . 15 % ( or more when you recommend friends ) . please call them yourself to confirm on 01235 442350 . what is least cost routing ? least cost routing is a system designed to save you money on all your local , regional , national and international calls as well as calls to mobile phones . why is least cost routing allowed to exist ? least cost routing is relatively new in the uk and has come about since the government passed a bill to deregulate the national telephone system . this ended the bt monopoly , allowing tcw telecom direct to offer you a highly competitive service with substantial discounts on your calls . how does it work ? least cost routing works by simply re-routing your calls through tcw 's billing system . it does this via a free "" smart box "" that attaches to your phone and bt or cable socket . in other words , you keep your existing telephone number , dial as normal , and receive exactly the same high quality service . you will then receive a bill from your existing telephone company for line rental and maybe some specialised calls and another bill ( lower than before ) from tcw for your local , regional , national and international calls as well as calls to mobile phones . your combined bill will , of course be lower . effectively nothing changes , but the total price you pay . the "" smart box "" is plugged into your existing bt or cable wall socket which is used for the majority of your calls . your phone is then plugged into the "" smart box "" . you then use your phone as per normal and save money . if there is heavy usage from another extension , you may consider requesting a second smart box . there is no minimum contract period . what will your bill from tcw show ? fully itemised call details with number of calls , type of calls ( local , regional , national , international , mobile ) , duration of calls , cost of each call , how much the calls would have cost without least cost routing .

"summary : "" grasshopper mind ""","short answer : "" grasshopper mind "" is british english , not japanese - english . summary answer : thanks to those linguist readers who responded to my query ( 5 . 1431 , 94 / 12 / 11 ) about "" grasshopper mind , "" an expression that is entered into kenkyusha 's japanese - english and english - japanese dictionaries ( 1974 , 1980 ) and roget 's thesaurus ( 1982 ) , but apparently not found in any monolingual english dictionaries . the respondents , in alphabetical order , were : deborah milam berkley , marie egan , ted harding , steven schaufele , steve seegmiller , todd sieling , and stephen p . spackman . the inquiry asked four questions : ) do other english language reference works enter "" the grasshopper mind "" ? ) is it a varietal or dialectal term ? when was it first recorded ? are ) there analogous "" grasshoppery "" words in other languages ? ( 1 ) looking up "" grasshopper mind "" in english dictionaries is a lexicographical dead end . i ' ve checked dozens - - including old and new , standard and slang , uk and us , - - and not one enters it . some larger dictionaries record a derogatory sense of _ grasshopper _ ; e . g . , the new shorter oxford english dictionary ( 1993 ) : "" 2 . _ fig . _ a person held to resemble a grasshopper in character or behaviour ; an inconstant , flighty , or frivolous person . l16 . "" and the near-synonym "" grasshopper brain "" is webster 's third new international dictionary ( 1971 ) usage example for _ grasshopper _ meaning 3 . 2 "" light and frivolous : untouched by care for the future . "" ( 2 ) harding definitively answers the second question : ) "" grasshopper mind "" is well-known standard uk english usage . to say ) someone "" has a grasshopper mind "" means that their focus of attention ) jumps unpredictably from subject to random subject . none of the other respondents , including three widely-dispersed speakers of american english ( berkley , egan , seegmiller ) , had seen or heard this collocation , but all agreed they could readily understand what it means . in terms of _ grasshopper _ meaning ' frivolous , careless , ' the semantics of "" grasshopper mind "" are fairly self-explanatory . ( 3 ) dating the "" grasshopper mind "" coinage is moot . harding says : ) i ' m sure it 's not particularly recent in origin . . . . i ' m pretty sure it ) must be possible to trace early uses of the phrase "" grasshopper mind . "" sieling suggests checking aesop 's "" the ant and the grasshopper , "" and funk & wagnalls new standard dictionary ( 1913 ) defines _ grasshoppering _ as : "" 1 . an unsettled and unsteady course of life ; improvident living : from the fable of the grasshopper and the ant . "" ( 4 ) "" grasshopper mind "" has cross-linguistic analogues . schaufele describes it as : ) like all those complex words in german that you can't find in ) any dictionary but which are crafted for the nonce by completely ) productive strategies and are perfectly understandable to any ) reasonably-intelligent speaker of the language ( i had to coin one ) of these myself the other day , ' lehrgangsprotokoll ' , to mean what ) we mean here by a 's chool transcript ' ) . spackman thinks "" grasshopper mind "" reads like a loan translation of a foreign expression , and mentions an interesting ojibwa calque : ) the phrase "" fire stick "" which has been given in novels and movies ) to ignorant american natives is apparently a literal , morpheme-by - ) morpheme translation of the ojibwa word for a gun . except for one ) thing : it 's not stupid . "" fire "" here translates "" launch a projectile "" ) and "" stick "" is the classifier for a rigid rod . "" rigid projectile ) launcher "" is not so snappy , but a rather tighter word than "" gun "" ) do n't you think ? the semantically transparent "" grasshopper mind "" reveals a lexicographical gap between english dictionaries published in the united states and the united kingdom . while unknown to most american anglophones and familiar to many uk anglophones , lexicographers have overlooked this metaphor for orthopterous mentality . modern lexicography is benefiting from computerized corpora and machine-readable dictionaries . for instance , searching for adjectival _ grasshopper _ + noun combinations in cobuilddirect 's on-line corpus ( direct @ cobuild . collins . co . uk ) reveals three occurrences of "" grasshopper mind , "" two of "" grasshopper warbler , "" and one each of "" grasshopper leap , "" "" weather , "" and "" nijinsky . "" many dictionaries enter _ grasshopper warbler _ ( locustella naevia , characterized by its buzzing call ) but none _ grasshopper mind _ . further research is necessary . any information about this expression 's historical origins or distributional usages ( seegmiller asks about australian english ) would be gratefully welcomed . michael carr , otaru university of commerce , otaru 047 japan email carr @ canal . otaru-uc . ac . jp fax 81 + ( 0 ) 134-22 - 0467

query : not not,"dear linguists , i am working on the double negative constructions like "" i did n't not come here "" and have been looking for the examples like that , but i can find only a few examples which i think does not cover all types of the double negatives . i would be very grateful if you could make a sen - tences using "" not not "" like the following examples and could agree with my analysis that they are basically "" understatements / litotes "" which obscure the speaker 's real intention . dr . larry horn 's _ a natural history of negation _ cites and exemplifies in detail such double negatives of "" not un - x "" constructions , but he made no comments on "" not not "" type . i assume that like "" not un - x "" , "" not not "" can imply not only "" understatements / litotes "" but also "" irony "" . do you agree with my analysis ? but unfortunately , i could find no examples of "" not not "" implying "" irony "" . bolinger ( 1980 ) states that "" a not unselfish act , you ' ll have to admit . "" is "" ironically euphemistic . "" i agree with him . but how ironi - cal ? what is the mechanism of such ironical euphemism and how does it arises ? can sperber and wilson 's ( 1981 , 1992 ) theory of "" echoic utterance "" cover all the types of such irony ? i would be grateful if you have a comment on this matter if any . the following are some of the examples i could collected : ( 1 ) a : you and jim really must come round to my place some evening . b : yes , we 'd like to . a : of course , you two do n't drink , do you ? b : well , we _ do n't not _ drink . ( hurford and heasley 1983 : 284 , _ semantics : a course book _ cup . ) minoru nakau ( 1994 ) _ nin - chi imiron no genri ( principles of cognitive semantics ) , taishukan , written in japanese , also quotes the above example , saying that b 's "" we do n't not drink "" is an echo or meta-lingui - stic expression of a 's words "" you two do n't drink "" , and also that b does not definitely say that they drink , rather obscure their intention and hesitate to admit they drink a lot . that is why b does n't say "" we do drink . "" in this sense , _ we do n't not drink _ can be quoted like _ we do n't "" not drink "" , where _ do n't _ is an external negation which negates the pre-negated assertion as inapproriate or false and "" not drink "" is an internal negation . the below two examples are also from nakau 's ( 1994 ) collection : ( 2 ) it is odd that _ coffee-grounds _ is plural . they may be "" composed of particles "" , but they are obviously _ not "" not _ too many for anyone to be able to count "" . the point is even more striking with _ dregs _ and _ lees _ , which are largely liquid . ( f . r . palmer , ( 1990 ) "" review articles : _ the semantics of grammar _ , by anna wierzbicka . "" _ journal of linguistics _ 26 : 223-233 . ) ( 3 ) for example , nouns such as _ heap _ or _ committee _ are _ not _ "" semantically plural but syntactically _ not _ plural "" . ( a . wierzbicka ( 1991 ) "" semantic rules know no exceptions . "" _ studies in language _ 15 , 371-398 . ) the next example is the one i found in r . b . parker 's novel _ valedic - tion _ ( 1984 ) . contrary to my analysis , this is not an understatement but some kind of emphatic expression . what do you think ? how do you interpret this example ? ( 4 ) susan said , "" i ' ve taken a job in san francisco . "" i put the glass down on the counter . i could feel myself begin to shrink inward . "" i ' m leaving tonight , "" she said . "" i had planned to stay the night with you and tell you in the morning , but i can't . i _ can't not _ tell you . "" ( r . b . parker , _ valediction _ , p . 19 ) my interpretation of the sentences in question is that "" . . . , but i can't ( tell you in the morning ) . ( but ) i _ can't not _ tell = can't help telling you ( now ) .

summary : hindi - urdu tense-aspect,"the original question stemmed from a comment in bailey 's urdu grammar ( 1956 ) on the following construction : mayng khaataa hung i eat . participle be . 1s bailey insists that this construction , despite looking like a typical progressive construction , must be translated "" i eat "" and not "" i ' m eating "" ( bailey 1956 : 139 ) . rather , the following constructions contrast according to the translations : mayng bactaa hung i escape . part be . 1s "" i escape "" mayng bac rahaa hung i escape stay . en be . 1s "" i am escaping "" ( bailey 1956 : 42 ) respondents were able to confirm that the first excludes the progressive reading , and that the construction with "" stay "" must be used for the progressive . this appears to hold for the urdu - hindi dialects . subsequent research suggests that the same phenomenon operates in neighbouring punjabi . thanx again to those who responded .

stylistics,"joanna thornborrow and shan wareing , patterns in language an introduction to language and literary style patterns in language addresses the real needs of students who may not have an extensive background either in traditional literature or in linguistic theory . this student-friendly textbook uses the principles of linguistic analysis to investigate the aesthetic use of language in literary ( and non-literary ) texts . written in straightforward , accessible language with imaginative examples and a humorous tone , it shows how linguistic knowledge can enhance and enrich the analysis of texts . the authors borrow from traditional stylistics , but focus primarily on the recurring linguistic patterns which are used by writers of poetry , fiction and drama . the authors draw on a wide variety of textual sources to illustrate their observations , making reference to both canonical literature and modern literary texts , as well as to popular fiction , television and the language of advertising . exercises designed to develop the students ' understanding of the material are provided at every stage , and sample answers are also included . interface routledge : 1998 : 280 pp cl : 0 415 14063 3 : # d5081 : $ 65 . 00 pb : 0 415 14064 1 : # d5085 : $ 20 . 99 jonathan culpepper , peter verdonk , and mick short , eds . , exploring the language of drama from text to context focusing on the characterization of speech as a form of action , exploring the language of drama introduces students to the stylistic analysis of drama . here , some of the world 's leading scholars demonstrate the importance of analyzing the text of drama rather than focusing on performance , presenting their approaches in an engaging and accessible style . the essays employ techniques from language analysis ( specifically discourse analysis , cognitive linguistics and pragmatic ) to explore the language of plays , looking at how different theories and approaches can be used to help us understand characterization in dialogue , the cognitive patterns that support the narrative and discourse of drama , and the basic mechanisms of conversation in dramatic dialogue . each chapter ends in a summary with follow-up exercises , and offers practical advice on how to analyze a play extract and write it up as an assignment . interface routledge : 1998 : 192 pp cl : 0 415 13794 2 : # d5353 : $ 65 . 00 pb : 0 415 13795 0 : # d5357 : $ 20 . 99

"" that "" is also perhaps by choice the strongest marker in english of restrictiveness in rel . cl . and since that is what the function of these rel clauses are to restrict the "" day "" or "" time "" we prefer "" that "" in a "" formal "" sense . as to the chaining with "" and "" , i suspect that what those kinds of sentences represent are : 4 ) i remember the first day when we played golf ( delete and ) that these noisy buggers came along and ruined our game .

re : 5 . 1205 linguistics and imperialism,"for what it is worth , i remembering hearing somewhere that the old persian empire used to employ a number of translators who were competent both in the imperial language and in the language of their region to carry messages throughout the empire . presumably , this was somewhat similar to the british empire where imperial functionaries used to receive additional payments when they had passed appropriate exams in local languages . an old family friend who was district commissioner for some part of uganda used to sit in court regularly overseeing cases in customary law which were always conducted in the vernacular . these were not languages that were necessarily well-known in the fco , although he had to make regular reports back to london . although he would not have described himself as a linguist , it would seem that his work depended on an amount of ( pre-theoretical ) linguistics . tony bex

15 $ 1 . 05 binding and control in ccg and its relatives mark steedman the ccg account of the unbounded constructions - in particular , relativisation and coordination - generalizes the notion of surface structure in a way that disrupts traditional notions of dominance and command . this has led researchers in other frameworks to suggest that the theory is fundamentally incompatible with a coherent theory of binding and control - the bounded constructions . the present paper offers a theory of binding in ccg which preserves the original account of the unbounded dependencies , and which renders it immediately compatible with other theories , tag in particular . the theory requires the abandonment of one assumption that has been traditional ( though not essential ) in other categorial approaches . the significance of the move is discussed . ircs-94 - 16 $ 3 . 66 null subjects in early child english and the theory of economy of projection tom roeper bernhard rohrbacher in this paper , we present new evidence showing that some of the empty subjects produced by young children acquiring english cannot be subsumed under the performance limitation analysis of bloom ( 1990 ) or the topic - drop analysis of rizzi ( 1994 ) . we argue contra sano & hyams ( 1994 ) that these missing subjects are instances of pro , not pro , and demonstrate that the economy-based pro-drop theory of speas ( 1994 ) handles our data in an elegant fashion . the analysis we propose links the acquisition of subjects to the acquisition of functional morphology , in accordance with the minimalist program developed since chomsky ( 1989 ) . one desirable consequence of the approach taken here is that no recourse to a pro-drop parameter is necessary . ircs-94 - 17 $ 3 . 41 kolmogorov complexity and the information content of parameters robin clark a key goal of linguistic theory is to account for the logical problem of language acquisition . in particular , linguistic constraints can be taken as constraining the learner 's hypothesis space and , so , reducing its computational burden . in this paper , i will motivate an information theoretic approach to explaining some linguistic constraints . in particular , the theory attempts to relate ease of acquisition with the simplicity of linguistic representations and their frequency in the learner 's input text . to this end , the paper reviews some results in information theory and kolmogorov complexity and relates them to a theory of parameters . ircs-94 - 18 $ . 87 active part - decomposition , shape and motion estimation of articulated objects : a physics - based approach ioannis a . kakadiaris dimitri metaxas ruzena bajcsy we present a novel , robust , integrated approach to segmentation shape and motion estimation of articulated objects . initially , we assume the object consists of a single part , and we fit a deformable model to the given data using our physics-based framework . as the object attains new postures , we decide based on certain criteria if and when to replace the initial model with two new models . these criteria are based on the model 's state and the given data . we then fit the models to the data using a novel algorithm for assigning forces from the data to the two models , which allows partial overlap between them and determination of joint location . this approach is applied iteratively until all the object 's moving parts are identified . furthermore , we define new global deformations and we demonstrate our technique in a series of experiments , where kalman filtering is employed to account for noise and occlusion . ircs-94 - 19 $ . 92 active motion - based segmentation of human body outlines ioannis a . kakadiaris dimitri metaxas ruzena bajcsy we present an integrated approach towards the segmentation and shape estimation of human body outlines . initially , we assume that the human body consists of a single part , and we fit a deformable model to the given data using our physics-based shape and motion estimation framework . as an actor attains different postures , new protrusions emerge in the outline . we model these changes in the shape using a new representation scheme consisting of a parametric composition of deformable models . this representation allows us to identify the underlying human parts that gradually become visible , by monitoring the evolution of shape and motion parameters of the composed models . our algorithm is applied iteratively over subsequent frames until all moving parts are identified . we demonstrate our technique in a series of experiments with very encouraging results .

asl dictionary on cd-rom,"my recent query concerning the new american sign language ( asl ) dictionary on cd-rom generated a substantial response , both from this list and from slling - l . i have summarized the main points of these responses below . please bear in mind that i have not seen the products in question . the dictionary reviewed on pbs is the american sign language dictionary on cd-rom by martin sternberg and is distributed by harpercollins . the following is the positive point that recurs in people 's messages : - - it is at the moment the only published asl dictionary that includes motion videos of asl signs , which serves to disambiguate unclarities in printed representations . the following are the negative points that recur in people 's messages : - - the dictionary is based too heavily on english , being essentially an english - to - asl dictionary . this both makes it hard ( at times , impossible ) to get an idea of the internal structure of the asl lexicon , and makes it less useful to native signers . ( there is , however , some categorization into semantic groups . ) there are also more specific problems arising from the failure to make asl distinctions that are not made overtly in english ( e . g . english "" lecture "" is used as a headword , while the asl equivalent is specifically a verb , not a noun ; classifiers are almost completely omitted ) . - - the dictionary is based on sternberg 's book-form dictionary of the early 1980s , and fails to take account of recent developments in the study of asl . - - there may be technical quality concerns , but since i have n't seen the product i ' m not in a position to judge . it seems to work better on more modern machines , and the mac version seems to work better than the windows version . alternatives : the following other cd-rom asl dictionary projects were drawn to my attention : - - multemedia dictionary of asl ( mm-dasl ) , release planned for summer of 1995 . this dictionary is based generally on the work of william stokoe ( who is involved in the project ) . it allows direct lookup of asl signs , incorporates recent linguistic work on asl , and is assisted by a panel of native asl users . for details , please contact sherman wilcox , university of new mexico ( wilcox @ mail . unm . edu ) . - - asl dictionary on cd-rom developed by dennis cokely at linstok press , 4020 blackburn lane , burtonsville , md 20866 , and alpha and beta tested by ken rust at madonna university , who should be contacted for further details ( rust @ smpt . munet . edu ) . thanks to : jacqueline anderson , nancy frishberg , marian macchi , mark a . mandell , joyce mcdonough , chris miller , karen mistry , becky moreton , cindy neuroth - gimbrone , steve seegmiller , mark seidenberg , barbara sensiba , dan slobin , leslie h . stennes , sherman wilcox , and the authors of the many messages that were forwarded to me from slling - l . - - bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu

new book from mitwpl : phonology - syntax interface,"new book in phonology available from mit working papers in linguistics in 1998 : truckenbrodt , hubert ( 1995 ) . phonological phrases : their relation to syntax , focus , and prominence . mit dissertation . 194 pages . $ 12 . abstract this thesis investigates what forces relate phonological phrases to the syntactic representation , to focus , and to the representation of prominence . the proposal that is defended is that there is a triangle of syntactic constituency , prosodic constituency , and phrasal prominence , in which the grammar places a simple demand on each pair in the triangle : ( a ) syntactic phrases must be contained in phonological phrases . ( b ) phonological phrases must have edgemost phrasal prominence .

french / english neologisms,"hi , i am new to the list . and since english is not my first language , i apologize for the mistakes you might find below : - ) . i hope that you won't mind if some of my explanations are in french . for my ph . d . semiotics , i am writing a dissertation on discourse and science-fiction and i need some information about the construction of neologisms in french and in english . ( neologisms are useful in sf , specially in the scientific field ! ) in french , neologisms are made in 5 different ways ( i hope these are the right english words ) : derivation ; composition ; imitation ; pure invention ; amalgam . one might also add borrowings from other languages . here are some examples ( sorry , the explanations are in french ) : - derivation : mot derive : "" position "" peut produire le verbe "" positionner "" ; - composition : mot compose : si "" monotone "" est decompose ( "" mono "" / "" tone "" ) , on peut recomposer "" polytone "" ; a partir de "" telephone "" on peut produire en science-fiction "" videophone "" . - imitation : souvent a partir d ' une onomatopee : a partir de l ' onomatopee "" couac "" on peut parler d ' un "" couac "" ( = un nom ) ; - invention : mot forge : se distingue des autres categories car on ne reconnait dans la morphologie du mot aucun terme existant ( ex . : "" emparouille "" , "" endosque "" , "" pratele "" , "" libucque "" , "" ecorbalise "" - extraits d ' henri michaux ) . cette categorie est contestee car certains pretendent qu ' il est toujours possible de retrouver la racine . - amalgam : mot - valise : reunion de deux mots sur la base d ' une homonymie partielle ; ainsi "" famille "" et "" millionnaire "" peuvent donner "" famillionnaire "" . in the every day french language , the 3 first ( mostly the 2 first ) processes are more frequent and the 2 others are used in the literary ( and humoristic ) discourse . my question ( s ) is ( are ) about the construction of neologisms in english . 1 ) does english use the same processes ? 2 ) even if it does , are the processes of the same importance in both languages ? 3 ) what would be the most frequent ones ? 4 ) what are the major differences ? 5 ) etc . thank you in advance , sylvie berard - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sylvie berard "" but the fact is , i really , really hate d346215 @ er . uqam . ca housework , even when universite du quebec a montreal someone else is doing it .

"eskimo words for "" snow "" , "" ice "" , etc .","as an eskimologist and an anthropologist , i strongly concur with woodbury 's and hill 's recent messages on the topic . i have two responses : one to the person who suggested that maybe what was peculiar about eskimo words for snow is not the number of lexical items to be found in a dictionary , but rather that these words are used more often and even by non-specialists within the culture . i am sorry that i can't track down the name of this person , which i must have deleted by mistake . but this is an interesting idea . my answer is that eskimos talk about snow about as often as a sahara tuareg would talk about rain , in other words , not very often . remember that the arctic is technically a desert ; i . e . there is very little precipitation , although whatever snow that does fall remains on the ground , an ~ rd is blown a } iround into funny shapes , for which there is of course , a technical terminology , used mainly by huntersd who need to use these things as landmarks . snow ( as a ground cover or falling ) is really not very important to eskimos . i suggest that we start looking at some of the languages of the subarctic groups of canada ( cree , chipewyan ) , these people live in deep snow , and probably talk about it a lot more ! my second response is for george fowler who suggest that there might be an fashion of eskimo words for - - - - - going on . he talks about 50 words for ice in greenlandic . he was speaking facetiously , of course , but there is a point to be made here . eskimos who hunt on ice ( such as the siberian yupik eskimos i worked with ) have an incredibly detailed technical terminology for ice conditions , icebergs , ice thickness and movements . for eskimo hunters , these things are concretely a matter of life and death . so eskimos do have many words for ice , and as for snow , this is a technical terminology , and as for snow , it is entirely based on a few stems that actually mean "" ice "" , and on many stems that do not fundamentally mean "" ice "" . so , at least in some eskimo languages , such as cnetral siberian yupik eskimo , there are actually more expressions ( or if you want "" words "" ) for "" ice "" than for "" snow "" . for the definition of a "" word "" and "" stem "" in eskimo , i refer y ' all back to woodbury 's statement . the point is that technical terminology for things that interest eskimos is no different from technical terminology that is relevant to , say , swiss cuckoo clock makers . willem j . de reuse dept . of anthropology university of arizona tucson , az 85721

cognitive science technical reports,"the following new technical reports are now available from the institute for research in cognitive science : probabilistic matching of brain images j . c . gee l . lebriquer c . barillot d . r . haynor ircs-95 - 07 $ 2 . 20 image matching has emerged as an important area of investigation in medical image analysis . in particular , much attention has been focused on the atlas problem , in which a template representing the structural anatomy of the human brain is deformed to match anatomic brain images from a given individual . the problem is made difficult because there are important differences in both the gross and local morphology of the brain among normal individuals . we have formulated the image matching problem under a bayesian framework . the bayesian methodology facilitates a principled approach to the development of a matching model . of special interest is its capacity to deal with uncertainty in the estimates , a potentially important but generally ignored aspect of the solution . in the construction of a reference system for the human brain , the bayesian approach is well suited to the task of modeling variation in morphology . statistical information about morphological variability , accumulated over past samples , can be formally introduced into the problem formulation to guide the matching or normalization of future data sets . bayesian approach to the brain image matching problem j . c . gee l . lebriquer c . barillot d . r . haynor r . bajcsy ircs-95 - 08 $ 1 . 80 the application of image matching to the problem of localizing structural anatomy in images of the human brain forms the specific aim of our work . the interpretation of such images is a difficult task for human observers because of the many ways in which the identity of a given structure can be obscured . our approach is based on the assumption that a common topology underlies the anatomy of normal individuals . to the degree that this assumption holds , the localization problem can be solved by determining the mapping from the anatomy of a given individual to some referential atlas of cerebral anatomy . previous such approaches have in many cases relied on a physical interpretation of this mapping . in this paper , we examine a more general bayesian formulation of the image matching problem and demonstrate the approach on two-dimensional magnetic resonance images . xtag system -

10 $ 1 . 28 in a lexicalized grammar formalism such as lexicalized tree - adjoining grammar ( ltag ) , each lexical item is associated with at least one elementary structure ( supertag ) that localizes syntactic and semantic dependencies . thus a parser for a lexicalized grammar must search a large set of supertags to choose the right ones to combine for the parse of the sentence . we present techniques for disambiguating supertags using local information such as lexical preference and local lexical dependencies . the similarity between ltag and dependency grammars is exploited in the dependency model of supertag disambiguation . the performance results for various models of supertag disambiguation such as unigram , trigram and dependency-based models are presented . a freely available syntactic lexicon for english dania egedi patrick martin ircs-95 - 11 $ 1 . 18 this paper presents a syntactic lexicon for english that was originally derived from the oxford advanced learner 's dictionary and the oxford dictionary of current idiomatic english , and then modified and augmented by hand . there are more than 37 , 000 syntactic entries from all 8 parts of speech . an x - windows based tool is available for maintaining the lexicon and performing searches . c and lisp hooks are also available so that the lexicon can be easily utilized by parsers and other programs . lexicalization and grammar development b . srinivas dania egedi christy doran tilman becker ircs-95 - 12 $ 1 . 18 in this paper we present a fully lexicalized grammar formalism as a particularly attractive framework for the specification of natural language grammars . we discuss in detail feature - based , lexicalized tree adjoining grammars ( fb-ltag s ) , a representative of the class of lexicalized grammars . we illustrate the advantages of lexicalized grammars in various contexts of natural language processing , ranging from wide-coverage grammar development to parsing and machine translation . we also present a method for compact and efficient representation of lexicalized trees . a processing model for free word order languages owen rambow aravind k . joshi ircs-95 - 13 $ 2 . 00 like many verb-final languages , german displays considerable word-order freedom : there is no syntactic constraint on the ordering of the nominal arguments of a verb , as long as the verb remains in final position . this effect is referred to as ` ` scrambling ' ' , and is interpreted in transformational frameworks as leftward movement of the arguments . furthermore , arguments from an embedded clause may move out of their clause ; this effect is referred to as ` ` long-distance scrambling ' ' . while scrambling has recently received considerable attention in the syntactic literature , the status of long-distance scrambling has only rarely been addressed . the reason for this is the problematic status of the data : not only is long-distance scrambling highly dependent on pragmatic context , it also is strongly subject to degradation due to processing constraints . as in the case of center-embedding , it is not immediately clear whether to assume that observed unacceptability of highly complex sentences is due to grammatical restrictions , or whether we should assume that the competence grammar does not place any restrictions on scrambling ( and that , therefore , all such sentences are in fact grammatical ) , and the unacceptability of some ( or most ) of the grammatically possible word orders is due to processing limitations . in this paper , we will argue for the second view by presenting a processing model for german . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * how to access reports : the reports are available in bound form for the price listed above , or may be obtained for free , electronically . to obtain a compressed postscript copy of the report , open an anonymous ftp session on ftp . cis . upenn . edu path : pub / ircs / technical-reports the files are named according to their number . for example , report 95-01 is stored as 95-01 . ps . z , 95-02 is stored as 95-02 . ps . z , etc . if you are using ftp , change the setting to binary and download the file . to get a copy of report 95-01 , you would type : binary get 95-01 . ps . z you can also obtain files through electronic mail . send a mail message to ircsserv @ ftp . cis . upenn . edu . the message should read "" send technical-reports filename "" . you will receive the compressed postscript file in reply . requests for bound copies should be sent to the address listed below , and include a check for the price of the desired report . checks should be made payable to "" trustees of the university of pennsylvania .

- the objectives - the tasks - the resources - the future this paper will examine various aspects of the above elements and will also refer to the nato terminology standardisation programme . 11 . 55 post - editing service for mt users at the ec - dorothy senez ( european commission translation service ) machine translation is freely available , via the internal electronic mail system , to all staff working in the european institutions . the machine translation help desk supplies a number of back-up services to a growing population of users . this paper looks specifically at the post-editing service ( per ) : - balancing quality and speed - rapid post-editing for short lived documents and end users responsible for quality control - the way forward at the commission . 12 . 25 dimitrios theologitis - european commission 12 . 50 discussion 13 . 05 lunch with an opportunity to visit the exhibition and network 14 . 30 introduction to afternoon session by chair - professor ruslan mitkov , university of wolverhampton , uk 14 . 35 from testbench to workflow : relocating mt in education and training - professor dr klaus schubert ( fachhochschule flensburg , germany ) and professor tony hartley ( university of brighton , uk ) the arrival on the market place over the last three years of relatively high-quality , low-cost mt and tm will lead to a greater demand in skills and expertise that also take into account the user and the requirements of the organisation 's workflow . this paper will look at initiatives of university of brighton and fachhochschule flensburg to give their students first-hand experience of evaluating a system in situ . this is achieved through : - the provision of an in-house mt service for interested end-users - the design of scenarios for inter-site collaboration - the introduction of elements of human - computer interaction . 15 . 00 some reflections about the pedagogy of mat - pascaline merten ( haute ecole de bruxelles - institut superieur de traducteurs et interpretes ( isti ) ) cat tools are of interest to both researchers and translators . they are being increasingly integrated in the education of future translators . this gives rise to two issues : - in education of translators : is experience of these tools enough , or is it important to understand the underlying concepts ? - computational linguistics is far from the empirical approach of the translator , and this does not facilitate the introduction of new tools this paper will look at how the integration of cat tools in the translation process is a good mean to conciliate the practice of the translator and the reflection of the computational linguist . 15 . 25 discussion 15 . 35 tea 16 . 00 improving translation at the source - dawn murphy ( multilingual technology ltd . , uk ) improvements in the quality and efficiency of translation can be effected at the time of authoring . this paper will examine : - the concepts of controlled authoring and author memory and the supporting technologies - the benefits that such techniques provide for the author , the translator and the translation manager - the processes involved in developing such techniques within an organisation . 16 . 25 lcc - the language consulting centre - language consulting in cyber space - jeannette orsted ( danish association business language graduates ) lcc is a project supported by the european commission . the project is a partnership between teleport sachsen - anhalt gmbh ( de ) , centre for language technology ( dk ) , erhvervssprogligt forbund ( the danish association of business language graduates , dk ) and gesellschaft fur technische kommunikation e . v . ( de ) . the objective of the project is to support small and medium sized enterprises in optimising their production and management of multilingual information . the paper will concentrate on : - language strategy as an integral part of company policies - language technology as a tool for language strategy - an overview of the lcc project and its services 16 . 50 discussion 17 . 00 close of day one 17 . 15 20th anniversary reception in the great hall aslib reserves the right to make changes to the programme without prior notice day two : 13th november 1998 09 . 15 registration 09 . 55 opening remarks by the chair - daniel grasmick ( sap , germany ) 10 . 00 horses for courses - the key to mt becoming a commonplace technology is acceptance - steve mclaughlin ( lernout & hauspie ( gms ) , germany ) user perception of machine translation is the decisive issue , and mt must be seen - not as a universal translation solution , but as one of several potential tools - not in isolation , but within the context of the user 's work processes what does this mean for machine translation vendors ? - mt should not be offered in isolation - products must be scaled to the user 's purse and environment - it must be easy to access and use mt - mt must be available when and where the user needs it , whatever the application 10 . 25 kielikone mt takes user - friendliness seriously - kaarina hyvonen ( kielikone ltd . , finland ) kielikone mt has produced a commercial mt product , transmart , which is in use in several major finnish corporations . in this paper , we examine how transmart has been adapted to meet the needs of individual end-users through four special features : - user-friendly interface - ability to preserve document formatting - facilitation of post-editing - document-specific translation lexicons 10 . 50 discussion 11 . 00 coffee 11 . 30 eptas - a client / server based translation support system - klemens waldhor ( ep electronic publishing partners , germany ) eptas is a translation server system which allows the integration of different translation components and various support tools . it contains a sophisticated linguistic database system and uses an advanced html based unicode document format . the main advantage of this system is that it allows the simultaneous usage of different translation methods , like tm and mt in parallel , which is controlled by a sophisticated process management system . this paper will examine the system and its translation tools that can be incorporated from other vendors too . 11 . 55 promt 98 - the current state - svetlana sokolova ( project mt ltd , russia ) promt 98 is the latest version of the mt software stylus . it is a family of different applications with the same mt kernel inside . the interface solutions are intended for different kinds of end users : - promt internet kit - promt home - pocket promt - promt professional 12 . 20 multilingual language technology in automotive documentation workflows - joerg schuetz ( iai , germany ) multidoc is concerned with the design and implementation of a new translation-centred approach to technical documentation in the field of automotive service and repair . the project is entirely geared by the needs and requirements of the industrial users who are fully integrated in all stages of the project . among the users there are bmw , bertone , volvo , renault and rolls - royce from the automotive side ;

summary and acknowledgments : [ n + v ] verbal compounds,"content - length : 5298 summary and acknowledgments on [ n + v ] verbs . in march , we sent a message about [ n + v ] verbal compounds . we were working on this kind of compounds in catalan and we wished to know what happen in other languages . we also asked for references . we received some messages . we briefly sum them up in 1 . in 2 . we list the people which answer us and , although we thank them personaly , we ( re ) thank them . 1 . summary our request said something like this : "" we are two resarchers at the universitat de girona ( sp ) and we are working on a kind of catalan verbal compounding . we sumarize tha characteristics of these compounds here below . we are interested in other vo languages with the same ( or similar ) process of verb formation . [ n + v ] v verbal compounding in catalan to be more clear we enumerate the relevant characteristics of our compounds . 1 . first of all , we must say that catalan is a vo language . 2 . our compounding looks like a process of noun incorporation where the incorporated noun within the lexical item is the ineternal argument in the syntactic structure . see ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) a . el cacador trenca la cama de l ' ocell . the hunter breaks the leg of the bird b . el cacador camtrenca l ' ocell . the hunter leg + breaks the bird 3 . nevertheless , the noun-incorporation doestn ' t affect to the capacity of the verb of assigning acusative case , this is , the complex verb remains transitive . 4 . this kind of "" noun-incorporation "" is only possible when the noun incorporated is a in inalienable possession noun ( ipn ) and the new internal argument of the complex verb is the possessor . see ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) : ( 2 ) a . corferir to heat + hurt b . colltorcer to neck + twist ( 3 ) a . * cadiratrencar to chair + break * ferrotorcer to iron + twist 5 . we hypothesise that the ipn acsts as a kind of modifier in the complex verbal form and it does n't act as a verbal argument "" most of the people gave us references , they are listed below . most of the answers coincide with the belief that this kind of verbal compounds are backformations from adjectives ( in - er ) or nominal compounds . then "" to baby sit "" comes from "" baby sitter "" for example . another repeated idea is that they are n't productive in languages as english , or romance languages . nevertheless , we still claim that both questions , the productiviy and the backformation , are not so clear in catalan . bertienetto notes that maybe there is a relation between this kind of nominal incorporation and a progressive aspect ( it has been also noted in the literature about the theme ; see , for example miller g . ( 1993 ) : complex verb formation , j . benjamins . ) . j . alvarez sent to us an interesting paper on incorporation and possessor ascension in guajiro . in that language , not only inp are able to be incorported but also other kind of nouns . we have n't demonstrated our hypothesis yet but we are carry on with our research and any comment is always welcome . references alvarez , jose ( 1994 ) : "" estudios de linguistica guajira "" . gobernacion del estado de zulia , maracaibo , venezuela . gavarro , anna ( 1990 ) : syntactic theory and the grammar of catalan compounds , phdiss , university of edinburg . klingebiel , kathryn ( 1989 ) : noun + verb compounding in western romance . berkeley , university of california press . robinson , peter ( 1988 ) : "" universals of word formation processes : noun incorporation in the acquisition of samoan as a second language "" velazquez-castillo , maura ( 1993 ) : the grammar of inalienability : possession and noun incorporation in parguayan guarani . phdiss , university of california , san diego . 2 . acknowledgements jose alvarez ( universidad de zulia , jalvar @ conicit . ve ) pier marco bertinetto ( scuola normale superiore dei pisa , bertinet @ sns . it ) george aaron broadwell ( suny - albany , g . broadwell @ albany . edu ) anna gavarro ( universitat autonoma de barcelona , ilfth @ cc . uab . es ) jose ignacio hualde ( university of illinois , jihualde @ ux1 . cso . uiuc . edu ) suzanne kemmer ( university of california , san diego , kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu ) arantza martinez ( univerisitat del pais basc , fvmaeca @ sd . ehu . es ) peter robinson ( university of queensland , peterr @ lingua . cltr . uq . oz . au ) max wheeler ( univerity of sussex , maxw @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) olga fullana ( fullana @ skywalker . udg . es ) lluisa gracia ( gracia @ skywalker . udg . es ) univerittat de girona dept . filologia i filosofia pl . ferrater mora , 1 e-17071 girona spain

news from the ippe ( 04 nov 94 ),"n e w s f r o m t h e i p p e world wide web access now available access to the preprints and all other materials in the international philosophical preprint exchange 's collection , including the abstracts and tables of contents of an increasing number of philosophical journals , is now available via mosaic and the world wide web . our www server is still under development and is changing rapidly , and at the moment there are still several rough spots , but access to all the ippe materials is in place . due to the rich interface provided by the web , browsing the ippe via mosaic ( or any other web browser ) is now the preferred access method . mosaic and other web browsers allow easy access to the multiple formats in which the ippe stores each paper , allowing users to as easily browse an abstract or an ascii version of a paper online as to download or print a fully-formatted version . in addition , we have provided navigation aids such as a colorful graphical map of the ippe ( not to mention the attractive new graphical ippe logo ) . in addition , much of the ippe 's structure , and many of our informational documents , are being redesigned to take full advantage of the hypertext capabilities of the web . expect further announcements soon . in ncsa mosaic , netscape , lynx , or your www browser of choice , open the url http : / / phil-preprints . l . chiba-u . ac . jp / ippe . html to pay us a visit . new journals online since the last "" news from the ippe "" in july , several more journals have joined our program of making pre-press abstracts , tables of contents , and in some cases selected full-text articles available online . recent additions include ethics and the journal of the history of philosophy , and arrangements are currently being made with five other journals , bringing the total number of journals available or soon to be available through the ippe to over a dozen . we invite the editors of other journals to contact us at the address given below . call for submissions the ippe invites the submission of working papers in all areas of philosophy . submissions undergo an informal process of "" minimal refereeing "" by the ippe 's international board to ensure that they are of contemporary philosophical interest , but need not be in fully publishable condition as they stand . due to the flexibility of our electronic media , no length limits apply . the ippe 's large collection of working papers is currently being visited by over 1000 philosophers and graduate students each month , providing the widest possible exposure for works in progress . authors benefit from the critical attention of colleagues world-wide . many authors have received incisive commentaries and forged important international connectins with workers in their areas , and the exposure produced by placing a paper on the ippe has also in a number of cases yielded tangible benefits including speaking invitations and offers of publication . copyright to a paper placed on the the ippe remains with the author , and therefore placing a paper on the ippe is no obstacle to subsequent publication . placing a working draft on the ippe provides an ideal way to beenfit from the critical attention of the international philiophical community before submitting a work for publication . call for commentaries the ippe invites the submission of well-reasoned commentaries on any working paper currently available on the ippe . commentaries are subject to the same "" minimal refereeing "" process described above for working papers . accepted commentaries are made available on the ippe alongside the original papers to which they apply , and the authors of the original papers are invited to respond in similar form . ippe represented at psa / 4s / hsa meeting the round table on electronic communications at october 's joint meeting of the psa , 4s , and hsa provided an opportunity for members of the ippe 's board to meet with representatives of several other leading projects in electronic media for philosophy and science studies . among the topics discussed were means of lowering

sum : x - rays and acoustic signals,"dear linguist members , some weeks ago i published a request for information about methods of measuring movements of the articulating organs . within this field i was especially interested in x - ray documentation and films . alice faber ( faber @ haskins . yale . edu ) wrote that "" back in the 1960 's the center for applied linguistics here in the us made a set of such films of ' exotic ' languages . we have a set here at haskins , . . . "" caroline smith reported on another method of measurement . she wrote that a method of measurement which works on the basis of electromagnetism was used by "" the people at the institut fuer phonetik und sprachliche kommunikation der universitaet muenchen , who are the world leaders in electromagneticarticulography ( fipkm @ phonetik . uni-muenchen . de ) . "" bob port ( port @ cs . indiana . edu ) from indiana reports on "" x - ray microbeam data at univ of wisconsin . "" and continues "" there is now a large amount of material available , but is not in video form "" a most interesting hint at x - ray documentation i want to give verbally at this place : kenneth r . beesley ( ken . beesley @ xerox . fr ) writes : "" i have also seen x - ray movies from the eastman collection in rochester , new york . these films show , among many other things , people talking , playing musical instruments , and moving in various ways . for medical interest , there are also films of swallowing and bladder functions . i have seen some x - ray photographs of vowel-production settings from the old ussr , but these are less interesting than films . the eastman films , produced in the 1940s and early 50s , i believe , are unintentionally frightening because the doses of x - rays considered safe then were perhaps 500 times what they are now . as best i can remember , these films were somewhat inspired by x - ray films made by the nazis using inmates of concentration camps . these films , brought back to the united states after the war , were watched in fascination by eastman and his colleagues . they featured scenes with full skeletons walking about . the x - ray doses were no doubt fatal to the victims . "" beesley also reports on phoneticians from the university of glasgow , scotland and members of the school of dentistry , who some eighteen years ago produced x - ray images that show people talking . helmer strike ( strik @ let . kun . nl ) delivers two methods of measuring articulation : "" the technique that resembles the old x - ray films the most is called mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . a good article on this topic is baer et al .

re : 3 . 396 chomsky citations,"i would like to second mark durie 's concerns with what he calls a "" pre-generative black hole in modern citation patterns "" . it seems a real problem to me that so many of the younger scholars trained in the chomskian school of linguistics are almost completely ignorant of any work done outside that school . on the other hand it seems those who do have a solid knowledge of the history of ideas in linguistics and have an awareness of typological diversity and have worked seriously with a number of languages tend to produce superior work . a prime example is the work of michael silverstein , whose work is grounded on a very thorough knowledge of the work of sapir , boas , saussure , bloomfield , etc . , as well as experience doing detailed work with american indian and australian languages , as well as a good knowledge of work done in the philosophy of language .

- - - - - - - - - constraint - based theories of phonology have become enormously popular in recent years . such theories express generalizations by stating how and when a language 's phonological forms are constrained , rather than relying on rules that actively modify the forms . computational ideas have often provided an impetus for these innovations . koskenniemi 's ( 1983 ) 2 - level morphophonological processor introduced parallel constraining relations as an alternative to an ordered system of rewrite rules . declarative phonology ( c 1990 ) focusses on the unity of representations and rules as constraints , drawing on various computational ideas from unification to temporal logic to finite-state calculi . one current constraint-based theory is optimality theory ( ot ) ( prince&smolensky 1993 ) . this theory found , at least partial , inspiration in computational work by smolensky on the relation between symbolic and subsymbolic computation . although this link with connectionism has been left largely unexplored , ot has proved to be a computationally productive theory , giving rise to several theoretical papers on computational issues related to complexity and learnability , as well as inspiring a number of implementations . this workshop is designed to foster the link between computational work and constraint-based phonology in general . to this end , it invites submissions on topics related to the computation of any constraint-based phonological formalism , including but not limited to the three mentioned above . here are some example topics : * the computational interpretation of phonological theories , * constraint ranking and interaction , eg . as in ot , * implementations of particular analyses , * results in the complexity of constraint application , * algorithms for learning constraints or constraint ranking , * results on the learnability of such constraints , * novel formalisms for constraint-based phonology , * representational issues raised by constraint-based approaches . in short , papers are invited which address computational issues in constraint-based theories of phonology . submission -

and tone delimited the sentences . the synthetic elements that still characterize many languages started but as analytic elements . for example , the b - past tense prefix in basque began life as a a simple adverb , ba , meaning "" already "" , and before that , simply "" over "" . the ie e-augment for non-concommitant verbal forms started out as simply the adverb * e , "" then "" , and before that "" there ( 3rd p . deixis ) "" . the formant - i / y , which forms adjectives in so many languages , was first the noun "" word "" , which acquired the meaning "" like "" . many languages like ie have factitive forms that are simply - - at origin - - combinations of the verb stem and an element meant "" it "" , in ie yo . the aa second person singular - k is simply a word for "" male "" . with this history behind us , it is difficult to believe that constructions like "" have done "" will not , at some some future , develop into v-prefix perfects . nietzsche , of course , said it far more eloquently , but the modern phrase "" what goes around , comes around "" expresses it quite well also . language , like all of existence , is not unidirectional . it has a direction only in the same sense that a very small segment of a circle appears to be straight . what really separates "" primitive "" languages from advanced ones , is the insistence of nominative-type ( g . a . klimov ) languages on an overtly expressed transitive subject . the mindset that this produces is directly responsible for the scientific approach that has resulted in the technology of the late 20th century . however we may wish to theorize , it is a fact that the scientific advances that have us all in a state of perpetual uneasiness , have come about through scientists who speak nominative-type languages , or who got their training in nominative-type languages . science is simply a matter of correctly linking cause and effect . nominative - type language are used to organizing their thoughts by reflex into a cause and effect algorithm . that is not to say that speakers of other languages cannot organize their thoughts logically . but logic and what constitutes a logical approach is culturally determined . factors that nt - speakers would reject as not directly causal would be difficult to eradicate from the "" logic "" of thinkers in other non - nt - speaking cultural matrices . the single advantage that synthetic languages have is freer word order , which can be economically employed for emphasizing or topicalizing selected elements of the sentence . but every analytic language with rigid word order has other devices to accomplish the same purpose . pat - patrick c . ryan < proto-language @ worldnet . att . net > ( 501 ) 227-9947 ;

errors in language learning .,"james , carl . ( 1998 ) . errors in language learning and use : exploring error analysis . london : longman . isbn 0 582 25763 - 8 ( paperback ) . rrp : 14 . 99 . the analysis of errors in cognitive , linguistic and other psychological processes has a long history dating back to the introduction of signal detection theory in psychophysics and behavioural learning paradigms . although many applied linguists now favour interlanguage paradigms for second-language acquisition , error analysis ( ea ) is still widely used in language classes . the attraction of ea lies in one 's ability to isolate variability in responses , such as distinguishing true errors from "" mistakes "" , which simple "" correct / incorrect "" paradigms tend to discard . in this new book on ea in language learning and usage , carl james builds on his earlier work on contrastive analysis and applied linguistics to further explore the role that performance errors play in language acquisition ( particularly second-language acquisition ) . the book consists of a historical overview of ea in applied linguistics , and then embarks on an ambitious attempt to both define and constrain the scope and methodology of ea in language processing and language learning . this methodology includes typologies for classifying and understanding how errors arise , as well as algorithmic specifications for the diagnosis and error correction in clinical and educational settings . the first chapter aims to give a historical overview of ea in the context of its origins , its inspirations , its competitors , and its influences on second language teaching . james defines an error as "" an unsuccessful bit of language "" ( p . 1 ) which seems to be as succinct and compact a description as i ' ve ever read ! however , this very readable style of writing , whilst appearing informal , is maintained through later chapters where discussion of technical issues could easily have been obfuscated by a poor writing style . first - and second-order paradigms within language learning are described in detail in this chapter , with the interlanguage and crosslinguistic approaches compared with alternatives such as ea and contrastive analysis . idiosyncratic and language-specific difficulties in language learnability are also covered in the context of linguistic change and metalinguistic influences on successful language acquisition . several methods for collecting data in ea are informally introduced in this chapter ( e . g . , error elicitations such as the "" broad trawl "" ) , which naturally leads into the second chapter on defining the scope of ea in language acquisition . the second chapter begins with an enlightening discussion of popular conceptions of what "" proper "" language is ( such as the king 's english ) , and catalogues the many failed attempts to enforce a "" correct "" dialect of english both in britain and asia ( the "" complaints "" tradition ) . this issue is clearly relevant for defining exactly what an error is , given the absolutist attributions made by some educators and policy makers about the tenability or correctness of certain forms of spoken and written english ( i . e . , "" standard "" english ) . james outlines some typologies for understanding language norms based on geographical and historical constraints , but correctly identifies deficiencies in these schemes ( particularly the failure , for example , to understand the role of colonialism in language preferences ) . this issue is taken up with respect to the issue of power and authority of native speakers with respect to non-native speakers of english , and conversely how the desire to speak a second language can unwittingly result in language loss and native - language change . chapters 3 , 4 and 5 focus on the definition and description of errors within the ea paradigm , having defined the focus of the ea methodology in the previous chapters . james begins by defining learners ' ignorance of a target language in terms of four categories of deviance : grammaticality , acceptability , correctness and strangeness . it is a clear advantage of the authors ' approach to ea that both grammatical / rational and performance / empirical approaches to language acquisition are covered by his typology , thus not "" taking sides "" with one viewpoint or the other . this rationale is based on the idea that ea is a methodology rather than a theoretical prescription . this focus continues with a discussion of error detection methods , in the context of locating and describing such errors in different parts of speech and indeed with respect to discourses longer than single sentences or phrases . the importance of a pluralistic approach which is tolerant of differences in dialects is emphasised , whilst ensuring that objective and stationary criteria are applied to utterances and writing within each dialect group . error taxonomies , such as feature and surface structure approaches , are outlined in detail with worked examples , which are one of the key design features of the authors ' pedagogical approach . computer - assisted analysis of errors is also discussed , as are specific algorithmic approaches to rating levels of error in lexical and grammatical processes . the next two chapters focus on diagnosing errors and evaluating their seriousness and impact for second-language learners in particular . possible negative influences , such as interlingual errors arising from conflicts between the target language and mother tongue , are treated in detail , as are intralingual errors and inconsistencies which the non-native speaker encounters for the first time in the target language , such as over-generalisations and false analogies . in addition , the role of culture in influencing and perhaps determining some aspects of linguistic behaviour is discussed , for example , how native speakers might "" gate "" a non-native speaker . error gravity and comprehensibility are also covered , as are some amusing examples given for "" the irritation factor "" . the sociopragmatic consequences of error production in social situations , and the potentially negative outcomes for non-native speakers , are also discussed . chapter 8 discusses pragmatic strategies for using ea to correct errors in speech and writing for second language learners . these are enhanced by a number of case studies presented in chapter 9 . the issues covered in these last two chapters are non-trivial for applied linguistics : is second - language teaching effective ? if so , which approaches are best suited to particular kinds of students ? are formal / grammatical or informal / conversational approaches superior ? although james provides no magic answers for any of these questions , he does present a coherent methodology for answering these kinds of questions for individual situations , which is the great appeal of this book . this book would be suitable as an undergraduate or graduate text in applied linguistics or tesl programmes , but will be an invaluable reference for researchers in related fields such as psycholinguistics and machine translation , who might be searching for a more formal methodology for understanding error production in their respective fields . this book will be an indispensable addition to every linguist 's library . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

genderless lgs,"content - length : 2009 hi you gender people , it may be that i have missed something that has been going on on the list . if i understand right there has been some claim about that a language totally lacking a gender system would be something of science fiction . as the responses have shown , this is not definitely the case but an indo - european line of thinking of what are natural conceptual ( grammatical ? ) categories . albert ortmann , among others , made the point that e . g . uralic languages generally lack gender . this is a point in case in finnish . the language does not have any grammatical gender markers ( in principle , no articles ) , no division into male / female in the pronoun system and , in particular , spoken finnish does not make distinction between animate / inanimate . persons , animals , objects , ideas may be referred to with the pronoun "" se "" . yet a slight comment to ortmann 's theory about case / gender . the point about case being realized only once in an np does not seem conceivable , at least from finnish point of view : attribute ( s ) and head must concord in case . hope this is of interest . and i could point out that i am no uralic or fennic scholar but a native speaking linguist . best regards - jan lindstrom dept . of scandinavian lgs university of helsinki

two summaries,"i apologize for being so negligent in posting these summaries to questions i asked 6 weeks ago . the responses were plentiful and very useful , and quick ! congratulations go to james vanden bosch ( vand @ calvin . edu ) and rob pensalfini ( rjpensal @ mit . edu ) who answered my questions on french loan words and language evolution before i had even received the posting from linguistlist . wow . the figure i had remembered was that some 10 , 000 words were borrowed from french into english . as most people said , it comes from baugh , albert c . ( 1951 ) , _ a history of the eng lang _ , 2nd edn . routledge & kegan paul , london , p . 215 . which was basically the only place i had n't looked . other interesting information : p . 327 "" according to jespersen , nearly half ( 42 . 7 percent ) of the french borrowing in english to ca . 1900 belong to this [ 1250-1400 ] period . 36 . > from thomas pyles , the origins and development of the english language . ny : harcourt brace jovanovich 1971 , 2nd ed . pyles is quoting ( his footnote 36 ) : jesperson , growth and structure of the english language , 9th ed . oxford 1954 ( orig . pub . 1905 ) . other references : coleman , julie ( 1995 ) the chronology of french and latin loan words in english . _ transactions of the philological society _ 93 , 95-124 . there are further references there . there 's also a recent book , i think , by christiane dalton - puffer . steve seegmiller wrote : the total number of borrowings from french is certainly much higher that 10 , 000 - probably ten times that number or more , if you count the word in an unabridged dictionary ( rather than , say , the 20 , 000 most common words ) . i have heard figures ( perhaps from jespersen again , i ' m not sure ) to the effect that 80 % of all of the words in are borrowings , and 80 % of those are from french and latin . > from terry nadasdi i just saw your posting on linguist . i do n't have an exact reference , just a suggestion of where you might consider looking . i just had a look at my m . a . thesis which was on english loan words in canadian french . i have a quote there which suggests that w . d . whitney might be a place you could look . the quote is as follows : "" rarely has any cultivated tongue , during a like period of history given up more of its ancient material than did the english during the few centuries which succeeded the norman invasion . . . "" this quote by whitney was taken from a . elliot , 1889 in an article entitled "" speech mixture in french canada "" , american journal of philology , vol . x , 2 "" speech mixture in french canada "" , american journal of philology , vol . x , 2 no . 38 . p . 158-186 . i unfortunately no longer have the article with me , but your library should have it in order that you might find the original whitney source which give actual numbers of loan words from french to english . thanks again to ( in no particular order ) : roslyn blyn - ladrew ( jladrew @ chesco . com ) david denison ( mfcepdd @ fs1 . art . man . ac . uk ) steve seegmiller ( seegmillerm @ alpha . montclair . edu ) terry nadasdi ( tnadasdi @ gpu . srv . ualberta . ca ) burns cooper ( ffgbc @ aurora . alaska . edu ) w . h . edmondson ( w . h . edmondson @ cs . bham . ac . uk ) terry lynn irons ( t . irons @ morehead-st . edu ) ( and anyone else i missed ) this was my original second posting about the evolution of languages : > i once read that the natural evolution of a language is from > analytic to synthetic . i ' ve been unable to find that assertion > since , and am wondering if i made it up . replies to this open question were much more varied and i ' ll quote them all . > from rob pensalfini ( rjpensal @ mit . edu ) : i can't comment on who might have said it , but it has probably been said . i think english serves as a counterexample to some degree , where you had a highly inflecting language that lost a lot of its inflection ( verbal and nominal ) and now uses prepositions et al where case marking would have once done the work . i always imagined it as a circle , so that a fully isolating language might start to incorporate certain things and over the centuries become synthetic , polysynthetic even ( incorporating not only adpositions but pronominal arguments ) . eventually , some of the distinctions encoded in the inflection might be lost , some of the inflection might be lost altogether , and then the language ( we ' re talking centuries later again ) might use independent words ( perhaps adverbials or something ) to indicate particular grammatical relations , and lo and behold you ' ve got an isolating language again . the fact that change in either direction is possible is why there are two sides to debates on things like what the ancestor australian language ( s ) might have looked like . australia has both head marking ( polysynthetic ) languages and dependent ( case - ) marking languages , as well as languages that are a mixture of the two . some people think that the original language was dependent marking and that truncation and cliticisation of pronouns led to head-marking ( ken hale and i are among these people ) , while other people take the equally valid view that the ancestor was synthetic and that case marking developed in conjunction with the loss of head marking . hope this was of some use , rob carl mills ( carl . mills @ uc . edu ) wrote : i do n't know who made up this "" theory , "" but they are probably wrong . on this view , what happened to english between ca . 800 and ca . 1500 ? ? > from peter daniels ( pdaniels @ press-gopher . uchicago . edu ) : there are some remarks on this in the new book by anatole lyovin , * introduction to the languages of the world * ( oxford , 1997 ) ; i do n't remember whether he gives references . but the notion of progress between types is certainly found in max muller . i believe it was folks like boas who laid it to rest ; meanwhile the romance future formation cycle had been noticed , and if high - class languages like latin and french could oscillate between analytic and synthetic , then obviously it could n't be an evolutionary sequence ! > from john halloran ( seagoat @ pop . primenet . com ) : a trend from agglutinative to inflective was identified by bernard h . bichakjian in his article "" evolutionary patterns in linguistics "" which appeared in studies in language origins , vol 2 , ed . walburga von raffler - engel , jan wind , and abraham jonker ( amsterdam / philadelphia : john benjamins , 1991 ) , pp . 187-224 . he also identifies some other trends in linguistic evolution . geoffrey sampson ( geoffs @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) wrote : my memory is that adalbert schleicher , who was the first writer to describe language evolution as a natural process akin ( or even identical ) to biological evolution , thought of the movement from analytic to synthetic as a decay which came about after the intellectual progress of mankind had attained a point at which it no longer needed to be supported by specific linguistic structures - - and that this was linked to themes in hegel 's philosophy , about which i am deeply vague . > from ian dale ( iandale @ ccs . carleton . ca ) : i take it you are referring in the first instance to wilhelm von humboldt . a few quick references . edward sapir ( language , 1921 , chapter 6 ) deals rather extensively with a rather more detailed typological comparison , without specific reference to humboldt . charles f . hockett ( 1958 , a course in modern linguistics , p181 ) dismisses such ideas out of hand , without giving a reference . r . h . robins ( 1964 , general linguistics : an introductory survey , pp 331 - 335 ) also discusses this sort of classification and does refer specifically to humboldt 's "" ueber die verschiedenheit des menschlichen sprachbaues , berlin , 1836 ( reprinted darmstadt , 1949 . "" but as to any sort of "" natural evolution "" , all ( and i imagine this "" all "" would include nearly all linguists ) agree that this is out of the question , especially if "" evolution "" has anything to do with "" progress , "" and especially since most languages display both synthetic and analytic features ( not to speak of such other terms as polysynthetic , agglutinative , isolating , and inflecting ) . > from asya pereltsvaig ( asya @ mail . netvision . net . il ) hi , i do n't know if it 's of any help to you or it will just confuse you , but i remember reading somewhere of just the opposite approach : that languages develop from synthetic to analytic . however , i can't address you to a reference right now . laurie bauer ( laurie . bauer @ vuw . ac . nz ) writes : if it is , the history of romance from latin needs some explanation - - or english from germanic , for that matter . yet if you consider french le livre , je l ' ai lu , moi in terms of phonology instead of traditional word breaks , we could argue that we have le _ livre je _ l ' ai _ lu moi in three words , the middle one of which is synthetic , derived from a more analytic j ' ai lu le livre . so we find both directions occurring naturally . whew ! thanks to everyone . this has shown me that there is no simple answer and that i should just as likely believe the opposite as what i thought i had read . m melanie misanchuk department of french italian and spanish university of calgary calgary , alberta , canada

accuracy of historical reconstruction,"in writing in linguist 5 . 1393 on another topic , martinha @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de ( martin haspelmath ) says : ) it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from ) modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and ) even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is ) very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is ) always imperfect . . . in looking at historical reconstruction done for s . american languages ( largely phonological ) , i ' ve often wondered about this . just how much could we trust the reconstructions that we did ? one of my rules of thumb for those languages was that if an item was longer than one syllable , it was suspect as being polymorphemic , and if it was longer than two syllables it was almost certainly polymorphemic . the problem is that most attempts at reconstruction ignored this areal phenomenon ( sometimes because the data was simply unavailable ) . from what i know of romance languages , i would say polysyllabic morphemes are more common there . if anything , that should make it easier to reconstruct latin , since you have more to work with . ( of course , the morphology of romance languages is much better known than that of the languages of s . america , which also helps ! ) so if latin would be very imperfectly reconstructed , what hope is there for native american languages ? has anyone ever attempted , as an exercise in the comparative method , reconstruction of latin from the romance languages , then compared the results with the real thing ? or reconstruction of any other attested language from its descendents ?

question on a word - reply,"many thanks for the replies ! in particular , i ' ll pass on the reference suggestions . i should probably be slightly more specific about what we ' re looking for : a word ( again , my friend writing the dissertation believes one exists ) that would fit in the sentence : "" word x has / is [ xxxx ] with the normal usage of word y . "" or else : "" these people have [ xxxx ] the meanings of word x and word y . "" that is , we ' re not looking for examples of x and y , or for a description of the general phenomenon of x changing meaning or having a special ( argot or jargon ) meaning , but we want to know if there is a term [ xxxx ] which would accurately indicate that x and y are being used synonymously when they are not normally synonyms . . . the specific x and y in question here are "" marriage "" and "" home "" ( yes , i do realize that "" marriage "" and "" home "" overlap a lot in their usage anyway ; i ' m not familiar enough with my friend 's topic to know exactly what she 's arguing , but i believe it involves a particular couple 's development of an individual and idiosyncratic concept of marriage , which at times becomes , um , blended ? with their concept of home to the extent that they will use either word to refer to it . . . something like that . regardless , you can tell from my attempt to state the question why a word is needed . . . : - ) replies by email please ( i ' m not a regular reader of these lists ) . and thanks again . jonathan gilbert jong @ dragonsys . com > > > peter t . daniels < grammatim @ worldnet . att . net > 07 / 29 / 97 06 : 45pm > > > an example would help , but it sounds like you ' re talking about jargon , slang , or argot ( idiosyncratic language varieties defined according to the user group ; see textbooks of sociolinguistics ) . > > > deborah d k ruuskanen < druuskan @ cc . helsinki . fi > 07 / 30 / 97 12 : 00am > > > words used in separate contexts changing meaning ? i should imagine there are quite a lot , particular if you think of american / british differences .

new books on pragmatics,"john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new title in the field of pragmatics : function and structure in honor of susumo kuno akio kamio & ken - ichi takami ( eds . ) this collection of papers on functional syntax shows the development of a specific stream of functional linguistics initiated by susumu kuno of harvard university . inspired by prague school linguists such as jan firbas and vilem mathesius , kuno developed a more comprehensive and theory-oriented approach and lined it with the american formalist approach of generative grammar . his approach is thus a unique combination of functionalism and formalism that constantly urges the promotions of interactions between these two major trends in linguistics . the papers in this collection coherently deal with functional aspects of linguistics from a wide variety of perspectives such as theoretical , applicational , experimental and diachronic aspects incorporating the functional concept advocated by kuno . < br > contributions by : noriko akatsuka ; jacqueline guillemin - flescher ; akio kamio and margaret thomas ; becky kennedy ; kiri lee ; use men et . al . ; ken - ichi takami ; etsuko tomoda ; aiko utsugi ; gregory ward ; john whitman . 1998 . ca 360 pp . pragmatics and beyond new series 59 . us / canada : hb : 1 55619 822 1 price : usd 89 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 5073 1 price : nlg 178 , bernadette martinez - keck publicity / marketing tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com john benjamins north america po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /",0

re : 5 . 1462 comparative method,"geoff pullum has raised the question of the null hypothesis with respect to proto - world and long-distance relatedness . i would suggest that the lack of progress in the dispute may be due in part to the conflict between two ways of setting the null hypothesis . a priori , in terms of evoutionary considerations , long range relationships going back to a single ancestor are to be expected : this point has been made by numerous linguists in discussion , if not so often in print . however , methodological considerations force us to set the null hypothesis the other way , since we clearly cannot disprove long-distance relatedness . the problem is analogous to medical disputes : there are plenty of researchers who would like to show once and for all that homeopathy , acupuncture etc . are of no benefit in the treatment of the illnesses for which such effects are claimed . but all that can be said is that we have no scientifically respectable evidence that homeopathy works ( please note that this is a purely methodological point - i do n't want to see linguist cluttered with replies disputing the homeopathic facts ! ) the greenbergian dispute is even less likely to be resolved by disproving long-distance relatedness hypotheses than the homeopathic one , since in the latter case one can at least do controlled trials : while there have been proposals on controlling for chance similarities , there will always be too many variables involved for the greenbergian null hypothesis to be refuted . steve matthews

call for papers : dgfs meeting 1998,"call for papers as part of the annual meeting of the german linguistic society ( deutsche gesellschaft fuer sprachwissenschaft ) , to be held in halle ( saale ) , germany , march 4 / 6 1988 , there will be a workshop ( arbeitsgruppe ) on the following topic : the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication in the last thirty years research on intercultural communication has attracted increasing scientific attention not only as a result of social developments but also due to the growing interdisciplinary cooperation between different disciplines such as cultural anthropology , ethnology , sociology , and linguistics ( c . f . ehlich 1996 ) . a central topic of the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication is determined by the experience that the use of a common language system does not guarantee mutual understanding . therefore , the theoretical conception of intercultural communication ( either in everyday or in institutional situations ) is characterized by misunderstandings ( gumperz ) . analyses of the mediation of intercultural competences show that both contrastive and interactive investigations into intercultural communication are important in order to answer the questions on the contextualizations of speech actions and on their universal or culture specific characteristics . only recently , has the innovative potential of intercultural communication started to attract particular attention ( c . f . koole & ten thije 1994 ) . it has become clear that research into intercultural communication should take an interdisciplinary perspective and requires reflection on traditional linguistic categories of linguistic description in order to see which new discursive forms are facilitated by intercultural communication . the specific question to be adressed in this workshop is whether the linguistic involvement in intercultural research has resulted in the extension and enhancement of new linguistic categories and research methods . reflexion on this issue should focus on topics like procedures of assertaining understanding ( verstdndnissicherung ) ( c . f . metacommunication ) , pragmatic universals ( c . f . politeness ) , contrastive analyses of speech actions and texts , linguistic forms of perspectivity or culture comparison . references ehlich , k .

language instinct,"isbn : 0 304 33908 3 , are we creatures who learn new things ? or does human mental development consist of awakening structures of thought ? a view has gained ground - powerfully advocated , for example , by stephen pinker 's book the language instinct - that language in much of its detail is hard wired in our genes . others add that this holds too much of the specific knowledge and understanding expressed in language . when the first human eve evolved from pre-human apes ( it is claimed ) , her biological inheritance comprised not just a distinctive anatomy but a rich structure of cognition . despite the impressive roll of converts that these ideas have gained , there is no good reason to believe them . pinker 's and other 's arguments depend on earlier and more technical contributions , by writers such as noam chomsky . many readers take these foundations on trust , not realising how weak they are . this book examines the various arguments for instinctive knowledge , and finds that each one rests on false premises or embodies a logical fallacy . a different picture of learning is suggested by karl popper 's account of knowledge growing through ' conjectures and refutations ' . the facts of human language are best explained by taking language acquisition to be a case of popperian learning . eve was not born a know-all . she was born knowing nothing , but able to learn anything . that is why we can find ways to think and talk about a world that goes on changing today . geoffrey sampson is a reader in computer science and artifical intelligence at the unibersity of essex , uk . this book is priced 45 pounds and is available at any good bookshop or in case of difficulty contact cassell on 01202 665432 . thanks very much joanne coen , cassell

sum : a ( formerly ) productive morphological process ?,"about 3 weeks ago , i posted in linguist 6-954 a query regarding the status in current english of a compounding process , involving the use of a ` combining form ' ending in - o - , which had given us not only such ethnic / geograhical terms as ` anglo - saxon ' , ` afro - asiatic ' , and ` dano - norwegian ' but ` sociopolitical ' , ` socioeconomic ' , etc . i was prompted in this query by the recent replacement of the label ` afro - american ' by the fuller form ` african american ' and by the appearance in a new edition of a college textbook of the term ` european american ' to mean what i have long referred to as ` euro - american ' . the issue first came to my attention a few years ago through a column in the university of illinois newspaper , in which an undergraduate woman of african ancestry explicitly rejected the label ` black ' on the grounds that it is , technically , inaccurate ; the skins of the people in question are merely a darker shade of brown than those of europeans . having said this , she then went on to reject the label ` afro - american ' because she could n't find ` afro ' on a map . as a linguist , i naturally wondered if she was unaware of the general compounding process involved . then a few weeks ago at work i found that the authors of the above-mentioned textbook ( on sociology , if i remember correctly ) had meticulously replaced every instance of the label ` white ' in the previous edition with the expression ` european - american ' . i began wondering if i was seeing a trend . first of all , i would like to thank the following respondents : lynne cahill < lynneca @ cogs . susx . ac . uk > lee hartman < ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > larry horn < lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu > james kirchner < jpkirchner @ aol . com > kevin lemoine < lemoine @ mail . utexas . edu > the general consensus seems to be that the ascendency of the full expression ` african - american ' can be dated to a speech by the rev . jesse jackson in the late 80 's . to quote lee hartman : ` i think the entire "" phenomenon "" can be attributed to a single individual , and with alittle research we could even determine the precise date when he made his announcement . this is a textbook case of "" pristine "" etymology ( where the historical events giving rise to a word are still alive in the memories of living witnesses ) . ` i ' m referring to an announcement made by jackson to the effect that he felt the term "" black "" had too many negative connotations , and that he wanted to institute a more dignified term for americans descended from africans . ` i think jackson said explicitly that he briefly considered the term "" afro - american "" , but he rejected it on the grounds that "" afro "" was too closely equated with a particular hair-style , and he did n't want a term that would suggest merely "" americans who wear afro hair-do 's "" . ' a second motivating consideration mentioned by some of my respondents was that the reduction of ` african ' to ` afro - ' involved in the formation of the older ` afro - american ' might be interpreted as deemphasis and might thus be irritating , if not offensive , to people who regard their african heritage as a matter of pride . this is quite plausible , although it is n't consistent throughout the general speech community : it is not the case that every english speaker , in every circumstance , regards the formation of the - o - combining form from some word for the purpose of coining a compound involves the deemphasis of that word or its referent . for instance , in regarding myself as a ` euro - american ' i definitely emphasize the ` euro - ' part . and another of my respondents pointed out progovac ' recent rejection of the label ` serbo - croatian ' in favour of ` serbian / croatian ' on the grounds that the older / more traditional / conven - tional label places too * much * emphasis on the serbian component . on a somewhat parallel note , one of my respondents suggested that the form ` euro - ' might be rejected because , at least to an american , its most obvious association is with the expression ` eurotrash ' , which i have to admit is not part of my experience ; i am more accustomed to its usage in europe , in which it tends to connote ` cosmopolitan ' or at least ` pan - european ' as opposed to narrowly nationalistic . on the broader question addressed by my query , there appears to be no evidence that the morphological process of creating combining forms in - o - is itself on the way out in english ; only one or two instantiations of it are currently being rejected by some people for sociopolitical reasons . as to the past history of this process in english ( it 's presumably either borrowed from or heavily encouraged by greek ) , i have so far heard very little . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *",0
n-ary comparison,"( 1 ) very strongly support alexis mr 's message on n-ary comparison being stronger than binary comparison . as real minds work , it is the pragmatics of not going down false trails which is at issue . i am puzzled only by what he mentions as an exceptional case , that is , how ternary comparison could * * * ever * * * be worse than binary . even if a third language is included which is more divergent , has more loan vocabulary , or whatever , and therefore poses extra problems or barriers . that is not a consequence of the ternary status in the comparison , because if the same language were included as one member of a binary comparison , the same problems would presumably be there . ( 2 ) i did not respond earlier only because of lack of time . the preference for n-ary comparison , the claim that n-ary is only a multiple of binary , is obviously false , just as the notion that one should not be engaging in comparison if one needs to use a dictionary is obviously false ( alice faber answered that one , that if that restriction had been enforced , our knowledge would be far less than it now securely is ) . both of these supposed restrictions are for the convenience of the linguist analyst , artificially restricting the data available so as to make it seem as if the analyst 's knowledge is more complete for the task than it is , and give a greater ( but artificial ) sense of psychological security . it goes along with the statement by some historical linguists that they "" never want to make a mistake "" . of course none of us do , but some are willing to in order to advance knowledge , and even those who do not want to cannot make themselves immune . the very act of disregarding data which is "" too far afield "" can sometimes lead to mistakes . always possible when trying to * discover * answers when we do not know the answers in advance . rather , we are all human , and gigantic problems will be beyond any of us to completely solve ( attempts at partial solutions do not imply guilt or wrongdoing ) . this in no way implies we should not attempt to solve those problems . we should be tolerant of others ' efforts and use the best part of them , always . ( 3 ) j "" org knappen 's suggestion of "" families , classes , and orders "" a la the biologists does seem useful . can we have suggestions as to clues when we should use one or the other of such terms ? presumably some more sophisticated measure of degree of shared genetic material would be most analogous to the biological usages , rather than a simple lexicostatistical measure ? lloyd anderson

a great business opportunity just for you !,"hello ! about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , "" ok , i give in , i ' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash . "" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate !

simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the "" internet "" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say "" bull . . . "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your 's , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : kathy smith 5312 s . e . 30 ave ocala , fl 34480-7524 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : micro info publishing inc . 2107 w . commonwealth ave . dept . 264 alhambra , ca 91803 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from : som co . 2168 s . atlantic blvd . # 101 monterey park , ca 91754 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : kal inc . p . o . box 2433 glenview , il . 60025-2433 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !

sum : sign-singing,"a few weeks ago i posted the following query : ) here in taiwan there is a tv program in which people compete ) to see who is the best singer . there are different categories ) for different types of songs / languages , etc . , and one category ) is for "" sign singing "" . a tape of a song is played , and a signer ) signs along with the words of the song ( all those i ' ve seen ) compete were not deaf ) . i was wondering if this is common in ) other countries , and if so , what the criteria are for judging ) who is "" the best "" , and also if it is done at all by people ) who are deaf . thanks . i received a number of interesting responses : ) from jane edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) : ) thought not pertaining to contests or even singing , for that matter , ) i saw something on pbs a couple months back which i wanted to mention . ) they showed a "" music appreciation "" class taught to totally deaf high school ) kids , in which they each were wearing pad on the back , which converts the ) acoustic output into pressure stimulation . the students were dancing to ) the music , and commenting on different types of music . they were n't ) singing / signing to it , but perhaps they could ? ) from jakob dempsey ( jakob @ u . washington . edu ) : ) one of the largest , most popular choruses in seattle regularly ) has a sign-language "" interpreter "" on stage during performances ; the ) particular one who has been doing it for a long time is not deaf ; he seems ) to also appeal a lot to the general audience with his expressive , exaggerated ) style . ) from midori yonezawa ( yonezawa @ student . msu . edu ) : ) i believe that there is a sign singing contest because music can be shared ) by everybody and it is natural to want to show different expressions each ) other . ) i learned japanese sign language in japan ( a little bit ) , and sometimes i ) practiced sign singing , too . i went to concerts where the singers were ) all professional "" shanson "" singers ( "" shanson "" is french loan into japanese ) . ) they have a concert every year for those who are handicapped , not only ) for deaf people . some singers sang with sign language at the same time as ) they sang vocally , and when the singers did n't do so there was an interpreter ) of sign language on the stage . i noticed and surprised that the ways of ) expressing by sing language are very different from each other and from ) occasions , e . g . fast / slow , soft / pressing , emotional / calm , etc , etc . . ) i also remember a tv program ( on nhk ) about equipment to help those who have ) difficulty in hearing . a technical group developed the equipment so that ) they can hear music . ) from peggy swartzel lott ( pslott @ utxvms . cc . utexas . edu ) : ) when i was a sign language interpreter and interpreter coordinator in ) san diego , california , there was quite a to-do a few years back over ) the issue of song sign . i first remember encountering song sign in ) the early to mid 70 's when a few groups of deaf performers ( i . e . ) musign ) toured the country performing popular songs in sign along ) with recorded sound tracks . later a pair of excellent performers , ) sharon neumann solow and gary sanderson , both individuals who were ) raised with deaf parents and fluent in asl , toured and performed ) songs in sign . ) ) the controversy in san diego centered on a local "" annual song sign ) competition "" hosted by the area 's rid branch , sanscrid . the ) competition was open to the public and was established both for ) a general "" deaf awareness "" activity and to raise funds for various ) purposes . prizes were given out for best individual song , best ) group , etc . the performance of the competition was quite popular ) and seemed to be growing in attendance and participation each year . ) ) a group of deaf people contested the competition on various grounds . ) the points i remember best about their objection ( because i ) personally found these issues most compelling ) were that the ) actual performances were offensive to some native signers because ) of the way putting sign to music distorted the linguistic and ) aesthetic dynamics of asl . that is , in order to make a signed ) narrative conform to the lyrics of a song , to translate it ) simultaneously with the recorded music , many grammatical patterns ) in normal signing had to be altered . often the performance bore ) little resemblance to normal signing . ) ) there was great debate for a while in the community over this issue . ) certain deaf people and many hearing interpreters and sign ) students defended the practice of song sign . some insisted that ) they be allowed to exercise their own artistic talents in playing ) with signing in this way . others felt that song sign provided an ) important bridge that enabled many uninformed hearing people to ) become aware of and appreciate the beauty of signing . the ) community was divided over the issue and eventuall y the whole ) thing was dropped . in the meantime , however , certain concerns ) of deaf people were brought to the surface and continued to be a ) source of discussion : issues about who has the right to make poetic ) use of signing and what sorts of alterations in signing style are ) acceptable to native users and which are not . i found the whole ) debate quite interesting and was genuinely convinced by the ) argument of the deaf people who were opposed to the practice . ) from richard arnold ( richard . arnold @ vuw . ac . nz ) : ) here in new zealand we have an annual new zealand sign langauge story - telling ) competition . mostly the competitors are deaf , but some codas also partipate as ) well . i have yet to see any hearing compete , however i know of some deaf for ) whom nz sign language is a second language learnt later in their adult life ) also participate . ) ) the winners are usually those who are quite fluent in nzsl . the criteria for ) judging is ( to my understanding ) as follows : ) ) - is the signing clear to the audience ? ) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called "" sweet honey in the ) rock "" who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf ; she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of "" helpers "" for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst "" loss "" resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like "" tra la la "" or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who work in ) theater . musical productions , because of their general inclusion of ) dance ( a more interesting visual event ) and costume / props / etc . . . are ) quite popular and well-attended ( comparatively speaking ) by d / deaf ) theatre-goers . many thanks to all those who replied . randy lapolla institute of history and philology academia sinica

sum : risk,"content - length : 15606 i was surprised to receive so many replies on my comments about "" risk "" . so far they include : alison huettner bart mathias john r . lee scott delancey deborah milam berkley tim beasley eric pederson claudia brugman martha o'kennon andrew carstairs - mccarthy sandi michele de oliveira ( trying to get sick = about to get sick ) debra r west balsa stipcevic i decided to post a summary for several reasons : 1 ) my comments made some respondents sufficiently insecure to wonder what other respondents thought . 2 ) i did n't want anyone to get the idea that my comments might represent an authoritative or majority opinion . 3 ) although i usually try to respond individually to everyone , i get tired thinking of different ways to say the same thing . overwhelmingly , but not unanimously , the respondents disagreed with me . alison huettner represents the majority response : "" funny , i have the opposite take on "" risk "" - - to me "" he risked losing the game "" sounds fine and "" he risked winning the game "" takes a little more processing . "" unusual was agreement , such as represented by tim beasley "" both sound good to me . the first paraphrases "" he ran / stood the risk of losing the game "" , "" he placed himself in risk of losing the game . "" the second , "" he placed in jeopardy . at risk . his winning of the game . "" as implied above , both sides of the atlantic want to disown me , e . g . , from bart mathias of california : "" no thoughts , but i thought i 'd report that i expected to see a . uk or . au or something in your address when i checked it after reading your message . i for one ( born and raised in california ) find "" risk winning , "" at least at the moment , causes a double-take reaction . to me it is equivalent to "" be in / put oneself in danger of . "" however , from john r . lee at an edinburgh address : "" this is interesting . i was very surprised to see "" he risked winning the game "" ! perhaps as a british english speaker ( ? ) , to risk losing the game seems a much more natural concept . "" larger context makes me think john considers himself , not me , to be the british speaker . in any case , andrew carstairs - mccarthy of new zealand made a similar comment . back on the american side , scott delancey agrees with the majority and adds some interesting grammatical comments : "" this seems * really * strange to me . my reactions are exactly the opposite of yours . a clausal complement of _ risk _ is * always * a negative and undesirable result . i can't even interpret _ he risked winning the game _ , except in some strained context in which winning would n't be a good thing . "" _ risk _ can have a positive np complement - - _ he risked his fortune _ is perfectly ok - - but not a clausal one , i . e . this could be expanded to _ he risked losing his fortune _ , but ? ? _ he risked winning a fortune _ is impossible for me . "" eric pederson and claudia brugman informed me that chuck fillmore has written a paper on "" risk "" . claudia writes : "" [ by ] sue atkins and charles fillmore which i do n't know whether they ' ve published ( or indeed finished ) yet , but they talk about these two meanings of the word in terms of the selection as complements of different aspects of the conceptual / semantic frame : one is where the desired outcome is selected , the other is where the "" collateral "" is selected . "" i have n't seen the paper yet , but it was comforting to the extent that it seems to take cognizance of my impression . however , i suspect that the "" collateral "" means a simple np expressing the desirable object , as scott allows , and not a clausal complement . thus some replies suggested that "" he risked his life "" would have to be expanded into "" he risked * losing * his life "" . i have to admit that that sounds better to me than "" he risked * keeping * ( ? ) his life "" . nevertheless , my theory is that in my rush to learn english i made the following logical leap . "" to risk your life "" is to risk something good , so you should risk "" winning t he game "" , not "" losing the game "" . risking fines , death , imprisonment and cancer were later experiences for me . i ' m quite sure "" risking life "" was the first ex pression i heard . by the way , i ' m not at all sure that i differ from others on our favorite gallicism of "" running the risk of / that [ something bad happening / will happen . "" , so that 's a different expression . i kinda doubt that genuine dialect differences are respo nsible for differences in "" risk "" - - only idiosyncratic differences in generalisations , some of which survive contradictory data learned later - - an interesting point that has been made before in language acquisition theory . among the interesting comments i received which suggest to me that relatively discrete semantic splits may result from such processes , and even become genuine dialect features is sandi michele de oliveira 's observation that in south texas the expression "" trying to get sick "" can be used for "" about to get sick "" . i wonder if "" trying to rain "" could mean "" threatening to rain "" in such dialects . of possibly different origin is the ambivalent serbo - croatian verb "" sumnjati "" ( = "" to doubt "" or "" to suspect "" ) . balsa stipcevic indicated that : "" sumnjam da je on to uradio . "" can have two meanings : 1 ) "" i suspect that he did it . "" 2 ) "" i doubt that he did it . "" here i suppose that the verb might have started off neutral to the belief status of its sentential complement , but it remains interesting that there is such a glaring pragmatic ambiguity in what a speaker might be implying . maybe english "" wonder "" is similar . "" i wonder if he did it "" . if he says he did , then the sentence would seem to suggest that i doubt it , but if he says he did n't , it would seem to mean that i doubt that . i ' m not gonna torture myself trying to figure out whether the same context - ualisation differences work for "" i wonder if he didn ' t do it "" , but maybe someone / body else wants to give it a shot . i wrote back to balsa that i hoped his comment on this verb is more generally agreed upon by serbo - croatian speakers than my comment on "" risk "" . - - benji

coling / acl workshop on multi - lingual information retrieval,"coling - acl ' 98 workshop multilingual information management : current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 universiti de montrial montrial / canada the coling / acl workshop on multilingual information management is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts considered these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational linguistics community as a whole . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * registration deadline is july 1 ! ! ! ! * * * * to register , consult the coling / acl home page at * * * * http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / mainpage . html * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * workshop description the development of natural language applications which handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop will be organized as a series of panels reporting on the outcome of discussions in the granada workshop ( a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the coling - acl workshop ) . ample time for discussion will be included . the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics-based ) o parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . o speech recognition and synthesis o language and speaker identification and speech translation program committee khalid choukri , european languages resource association charles fillmore , university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid , university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy , information sciences institute , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa mun kew leong , national university of singapore joseph mariani , limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury , the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg , new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura , nec , japan martha palmer , university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky , brandeis university , usa peter schaueble , eth zurich , switzerland oliviero stock , irst , italy felisa verdejo , uned , spain piek vossen , university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster , dfki , germany antonio zampolli , istituto di linguistica computazionale , italy organizers bob frederking center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6656 fax : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu eduard hovy information sciences institute of the university of southern california 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : ( + 1 310 ) 822-1511 fax : ( + 1 310 ) 823-6714 email : hovy @ isi . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa tel : ( + 1 914 ) 437 5988 fax : ( + 1 914 ) 437 7498 e - mail : ide @ cs . vassar . edu

re : 5 . 1484 comparative syntax,"since chet creider 's posting of 8 dec rightly corrected some misinformation i gave in my off-the - top-of - the-head posting about karamojong , i decided to make amends by doing a little research ( very little ) to check the rest of what i said . consider it a xmas gift . below is the relevant section of recent nilo - saharan classification ( sudanic : nilotic ) . it 's basically the same as greenberg ( 1963 ) with some refinements in further branching but no rearrangement of limbs . east sudanic has four branches , including eastern and western , then nilotic with three branches , including west , east and south . karamojong belongs to the east branch of the nilotic branch of east sudanic . it is therefore classified as closer to maasai ( maa - lotuko branch ) and bari ( bari branch ) than to the lwo branch of the west branch of nilotic , but no closer to kalenjin , a group in the south branch ( e . g . , nandi ) than to the west branch . the following is a relatively recent classification , such as found in schadeberg 's ( 1981 ) article on nilo - saharanisch . central sudanic : moru - madi - lugbara etc east sudanic : eastern : nubian western : tama , daju kuliak : ik , so nilotic : west : ( some call it north nilotic ) burun : idem nuer - dinka : idem lwoo : north : shilluk , anwak south : achooli , luo east : ( some call it central nilotic ) bari : bari , kakwa etc maa - lotuko : maasai etc teso - turkana : karamojong , jie etc south : kalenjin : nandi - markweta : nandi , tuken elgon : sapiny , pok okiek / dorobo : sogoo etc datoga : etc beside the bewildering array of east and west branches of branches down the sudanic line i can trace my inaccuracy to conolly 's mention of jie . as a language , jie , along with karamojong and various other languages such as teso , are part of the teso - turkana branch of east nilotic . however , in an earlier classification , e . g . , crazzolara ( 1938 ) , jii is the name used for west nilotic ( or at least the current lwo and nuer - dinka branches ) . jii means "" people "" ( or "" ordinary people "" ) in most of the west nilotic languages , hence the classificational name . the dinka call themselves "" jieng ' "" . i suspect that the east nilotic jie ( also spelled "" jiye "" ) is the same word , but i have n't checked if the jie actually call themselves that . african language nomenclature is full of terms not used by the speakers themselves ( but often by sarcastic neighbors , so that , for example , while the dinka evidently see no stigma in their autonym , the achooli use the term somewhat like english uses the term "" the masses "" , cf . hoi polloi ) . just for fun let 's see how accurate what i said was about the numbers from one to ten are . we do n't need six through nine , because they are compounds of five plus numbers under five . the data for most languages are restricted to what i happened to have within reach without doing library research . however , the data for bari and teso ( ateso , in my experience ) are from transcriptions of recordings i made a long time ago in east africa before i even knew how these languages were classified . i do n't have published linguistic data on hand for them . in all cases i have simplified orthography for typographical ease ( losing information ) . for example , the "" h "" following a vowel refers to the retracted ( lax - sounding ) tongue root position of that vowel . the nilotic languages have complex vowel systems with "" tense "" and "" lax "" subsystems . of course , lexical numbers by themselves do not prove anything about genetic af finities . nevertheless , some interesting patterns emerge to compare with the currently accepted classification scheme . west nilotic : achooli anwak luo dinka nuer 1 ace : hl achyehloh achiel tok kehl 2 aryo : h areahu ariyo rou rahu 3 adeek adahgoh adehk diak dyohk 4 ang ' we : hn ang ' wehnoh ang ' wen ng ' wan ng ' wan 5 abiic abiyuh abihch dhiec dye : ch 10 apaar apar apar thiaar wahl the first consonant in ' 5 ' seems to be diagnostic of the distinctness of nuer - dinka from the lwoo group . otherwise , dinka ' 1 ' is wierd , and so is the first consonant of dinka ' 10 ' ( cf . dinka - nuer ' 5 ' ) , but not much wierder than a comparison of indo - european numbers ( cf . germanic ' 4 - 5 ' or slavic ' 9-10 ' ) . reconstruction is not difficult , although you do n't have an accurate transcription of the vowel distinctions ( or tone ) . east and south ( nandi ) nilotic : ( afro - asiatic : cushitic ) bari teso maasai nandi somali 1 kyeling ' diopeti - bo akenge kow ( southern also ' hal ' ) 2 morehk iyere - re aeng lamma 3 msala : iu ~ li - uni somok siddah 4 ingwan iwong ' wahn - ong ' uan angwan afar 5 mukanad ikany imiet mut shan 10 pwahk itomony tomon taman tommon the numbers ' 2 ' and ' 4 ' are consistent with west nilotic . otherwise , lexicon appears to be areally defined . first maasai and nandi seem to have a cognate for west nilotic ' 5 ' . however , maasai is classified with bari and teso as east nilotic . thus , bari and teso seem to share an innovation for ' 5 ' which does not extend to maasai or south nilotic . meanwhile the cognacy of bari ' 3 ' with teso and maasai is questionable , and nandi ' 3 ' is beyond the pale . interestingly , my data for bari has ' 10 ' as given , while greenberg gives bari ' 10 ' as "" mere "" in one of his mass cognate sets ( p . 106 ) . "" pwahk "" fits in with the west nilotic set , but presumably g 's data comes from a published source . ( i have n't loo ked at my data since i transcribed it - - several decades , but i relistened to my bari tape to make sure i had n't transposed the word for ' 10 ' with some other word like ' toothbrush ' . ) by the way , teso is closely related to karamojong so i would expect the numbers to be similar , including the cushitic loan for ' 10 ' , but with doubts about whether karamojong ' 5 ' would follow the maasai or bari - teso pattern . ( gotta go to the library for this one . any volunteers ? ) the word for ' 10 ' in the other east and south nilotic languages was recognised by g as a loan from somali or one of the mutually intelligible galla languages of cushitic . that 's why i gave the somali numbers above . easy to see it would be a lot more difficult to argue for somali as nilotic than for the other languages [ uhm , if their other lexical correspondences behave like their numbers - - which they do . . . g actually uses the example of cushitic multiple of ten in maasai in his arguments against meinhof 's nilo - hamitic hypothesis . cushitic was part of "" hamitic "" in the older terminology ( "" afro - asiatic "" is g 's coinage for older "" semito - hamitic "" ) . . note nubian ' 10 ' below . . thus , g has been as sharp to use arguments about borrowing against his opponents as have his opponents against him . what to do ? east sudanic central sudanic nubian lugbara 1 we : rum aluh 2 awum iri 3 toskum na 4 kemsum su 5 dijum towi 10 dimnum muhdri wow ! numbers do n't help unite nubian as a branch of east sudanic with nilotic . obviously other criteria were used . for superifical impression nubian ' 10 ' looks promising as cognate with south and most of east nilotic , and maybe it is , but that card has already been played non-genetically above - - and with good reason . . g , p106 again , compares bari ' 10 ' "" mere "" with khordofan nubian "" bure "" for the same ) . as central sudanic , lugbara might be expected by the naive to be even more different from nilotic than nubian , but the numbers do n't show that . g uses lugbara ' 2 ' in his mass cognate sets for the unity of central and east sudanic . interestingly , he also uses dinka ' 1 ' , the wierd one for west nilotic , in the same mass cognate sets - - for comparison with ' 10 ' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for "" one "" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto - nilotic ( despite the suggestiveness of bari and nandi ' 1 ' above ) . g could be right , for all i know . anyway , i ' m just as interested in the areal cross-currents as in the hypotheses about genetic relationships . thus , other implications emerge from g 's mass comparison s , e . g . , the pan - nilotic word for ' 4 ' must be an areal innovation ( maybe in proto - nilotic ) since it does not occur elsewhere in nilo - saharan , or in any other known language group for that matter . so , ok . we have some pretty strong hypotheses . i have n't followed nilo - saharan studies closely , though nubian , but the numbers do n't show that . g uses lugbara ' 2 ' in his mass cognate sets for the unity of central and east sudanic . interestingly , he also uses dinka ' 1 ' , the wierd one for west nilotic , in the same mass cognate sets - - for comparison with ' 10 ' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for "" one "" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto - nilotic ( despite the suggestiveness of bari and nandi ' 1 ' above ) . g could be right , for all i know . anyway , i ' m just as interested in the areal cross-currents as in the hypothese about genetic relationships . thus , other implications emerge from g 's mass comparisons , e . g . , the pan - nilotic word for ' 4 ' must be an areal innovation ( maybe in proto - nilotic ) since it does not occur elsewhere in nilo - saharan , or in any other known language group for that matter . so , ok . we have some pretty strong hypotheses . i have n't followed nilo - sahara n studies closely , though west african niger - congo ( actually the benue - kwa grou p of niger - congo ) . greenberg ( 1963 ) notes that westermann also used the label for various east sudanic languages ( w had done some fieldwork on nilotic ) , beli eving that they were related to the west african niger - congo ( i . e .

ecml ' 98 tanlps workshop : first call for paper,"ecml-98 workshop : first call for papers ecml-98 workshop : towards adaptive nlp - driven systems : linguistic information , learning methods and applications organized by : r . basili , m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata ) , italy since most of the applications , from syntactic to semantic , are lexicon driven , systematic and reliable acquisition on a large scale of linguistic information is the real challenge to natural language processing ( nlp ) . empiricist view on natural language processing and learning has become recently more attractive for a wider research community : computational linguistics , artificial intelligence , psychology then seemed to converge on a specific data-oriented perspective aiming to overcome the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck . it has been often noted that the limited attention paid by the machine learning community to text and speech data seems unjustified . it is thus more and more evident that empirical learning of natural language processing ( nlp ) can alleviate the nlp main problem by means of a variety of methods for the automatic induction of lexical knowledge . lexical knowledge is often hard to compile by hand , and even harder to port and reuse . nlp application systems have still a low impact on real world problems , mainly due to the costs related to reusability and customization of the required lexicons . in particular changes in the domain , causes changes in the lexical information required in the underlying natural language . empirical , symbolic machine learning methods can be perfectly suited for this task like automatic acquisition and adaptation of this klnowledge . rule induction , symbolic approaches to clustering , lazy learning , and inductive logic programming , have been already proposed by a growing community that is entering the challenge for theoretical ( i . e . methodological ) and application purposes a variety of techniques seems to be combined in order to successfully design realistic inductive systems for text processing : the target of this research are methodological and design principles for systems combining linguistic and lexical learning capabilities for large scale language processing tasks . this is what we mean with adaptive nlp - driven systems . within this research enterprise , some issues can favour a sinergistic process between nlp and ml areas : the access to large data sets , that are even increasing over time , due to the telematics facilities available nowaday ; extending the set of typical classes of ml problems to other hard cases ( particularly dense in the nlp processes ) ; adding inductive capabilities to nlp system for tasks related to specific applications ( i . e . information extraction ) . the proposed workshop is thus aiming to stimulate reasearch and discussion on the following aspects : - establishing results and evidencies on the suitability of different ml paradigms on specific levels of representation of lexical knowledge ( morphology , syntax , linguistic inference among others ) - comparison of the quantitative approaches to lexical acquisition with empirical symbolic methods - stimulating discussion on cognitive perspective of some models within a plausible architecture for language processing and learning - establishing results on the applicability of the extracted / induce knowledge within nlp systems , with respect to assessed evaluation criteria , typical of the ml and language engineering ( le ) area - case studies on adaptive nlp systems , i . e . effective nlp systems integrating linguistic inferences with inductive capabilities ( www kb at cmu , ecran ) , - critical review of existing experiences on adaptive nlp systems - establishing guidelines for an evaluation framework of adaptive nlp systems : accuracy of the linguistic process , robustness of the induction process , . . . - promote cooperation among research groups in europe and usa to exchange ideas , data and tools for design and experiment architectures for adaptive nlp systems workshop format : the workshop is expected to cover the whole day . in the first session , a part from an invited talk , we expect to cover methodological issues . papers related to advanced research on suitability of learning paradigms for the different target lexical information will be favoured . prototypical examples in this area are studies on empirical learning of tasks like pos tagging , induction of grammatical information , symbolic learning of word sense disambiguation criteria and lexical semantic information . a panel discussion is expected to close the morning session and focus on principles of suitability for learning paradigms vs . lexical levels . in the second half of the day we expect to stimulate partecipants to cover application areas , like ir and ie , by a couple of invited talks on existing adaptive systems as a basis for presenting novel aspects on integration of nlp capabilities with learning from experience ( examples , errors , performance ) . a set of at least other 3 or 4 papers is expected to concentrate on original research works that we know are currently under development in several reasearch centres in europe ( sheffield university , tilburg , rome tor vergata and torino university ) . a panel discussion on the implication of the adaptive paradigm on existing and potential nlp systems will close the workshop . program committee r . basili ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) m . craven ( carnegie mellon university , usa ) w . daelemans ( university of tilburg , nederlands ) m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) l . saitta ( university of torino , italy ) c . samuelssonn ( bell labs , at&t , usa ) y . wilks ( university of sheffield , uk ) paper submission : = = = = = = = = = = = = papers should not exceed 3000 words or 6 pages hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained postscript or rtf formats , to basili @ info . utovrm . it for each submission - - whether hard copy or electronic - - a separate plain ascii text email message should be sent to roberto basili , containing the following information : # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if attachments are submitted electronically ) # note : any relevant instructions # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper . . . . . . timetable : workshop announcement and call for papers : 5 january 1998 papers due : 15 february 1998 notification of acceptance : 5 march 1998 final version due : 25 march 1998 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it tel : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7391 fax : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7460 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

disc . sex / lang,"i have been proceeding with a "" disc he / she "" theme . it has been somewhat expanded , and i would like to have it posted under the "" disc : sex / lang "" subject head . thanks , jw ] in the continuing discussion of pronouns , i ' m making a summary and a shift . the shift is spurred by the necessity to widen the orbit from pronouns to "" sex and language "" , perhaps an inevitable transition . alexis manaster ramer ( see below ) has suggested that a discussion of universal male dominace in society / language should take place prior to one of pronouns . i willingly go along , but reject the misandrist characterization . first the pronoun summary . "" he "" summary in my "" he "" work , i have suggested that to understand the generic and proverbial uses of modern english "" he "" , one would have to integrate into their data the facts that 1 ) "" he "" as a feminine pronoun survived much later in historical english than is generally acknowledged , and that 2 ) the late-archaic english "" he "" , on the one hand , as feminine , had an association with the all-genders plural , and on the other , as a masculine , had an association with the singular and neuter . "" him "" and "" his "" were during middle english , and later , also neuter ( "" not one or the other "" ) pronouns , and the ontogeny of the modern paradigm must account for these facts . there are more than a few examples of "" he "" in a generic / proverbial context in which , if there is any sex distinction at all , it must be considered feminine , not masculine , as in the following ( _ piers plowman _ , walter kane - - passus vii , manuscript h3 , lines 235-36 ) : he that etyn here fode throw trauail god 3eueth they / she that eat / eats their / her food through work god gives hem his blissing that here liflode so wynneth them his blessing that their / her livelihood so earns . _ _ _ when the 18th century grammarians put the "" he "" rule on paper , the feminine morphology was not unknown , not yet forgotten . if gender feminists today put a gendrist interpretation on the grammarians ' motives and on the evolution of the "" he "" rule , it is through historical oversight , to put it kindly , and not for , as some maintain , misogynist motives , conscious or unconscious . finally , i have challenged the interpretation of the "" worthiness "" doctrine . according to it , the grammarians of yore said "" he "" was more "" worthy "" . the word "" worthy "" has , i believe , been too quickly accepted in its old english root-meaning of "" deserving "" , whereas i have yet to see any contexts that contradict its other meaning , based on its other old english root , "" appropriate "" . are there any clarifying contexts ? please show i ' m wrong . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sex and language alexis manaster ramer sent me a personal response to my ideas ; when i asked , he said i could post for general reading . ( btw , what are some of the etymologies given for "" girl "" , "" boy "" , "" marry "" ? ) alexis says : thank you for responding . since we obviously agree about the final resolution of this issue , i guess i would say that there are simply two aspects to the way one must respond to the people who are claiming that the generic he was invented by male chauvinist grammarians . one is yours ( that it has a continuous history within english ) [ did i say that ? - jw ] . the other is mine ( that if we knew nothing about the history of english , the universal picture would authorize us to suppose that this was indeed a natural phenomenon , not an invention of the grammarians ) . but i would then say that the presumed reason why this phenomenon is universal is presumably that all known cultures ( or maybe there is one exception , according to what i read somewhere ) have been male-dominated at all known time periods , and the fact that masculine / male is ' unmarked ' must surely be a reflection of this . so , the locus of the blame [ ! ] shifts from the conscious work of english grammarians to the subconscious workings of the language faculties of countless generations of human beings all over the planet who have lived in societies where there was no concept of sex equality . what do you think ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff responds thanks for the elaboration . what do i think ? first , to get it straight . . . you are saying that comparable structures to "" generic he "" are found in all languages ( with perhaps a few exceptions ) , and on that basis a person might be led to conclude it is a natural phenomenon , but they would be wrong . rather , universal male domination is the explanation , as seen in the unmarked pronoun "" he "" , and we must "" blame "" the subconscious workings of the language faculties of all people in history , who have had no concept of sex equality . i have three questions , each of which i provide some of my own views about . 1 ) what are some of the parameters of and who ( authors ) do you look to for your idea that all history has been male dominated ? ( i personally resent this characterization . ) "" dominated "" hinges on what you mean - - the crimson sunset dominated the horizon and the pimples dominated the young girl 's face . on a group level , men , qua males , have been sufficiently dutiful to "" women and children first "" that they can be said to have historically regarded their own lot as the more expendable , i . e . , at least as might say the contour of a bell-curve measuring such a thing . men subdue the metaphorical colin fergusons of the world , not women . on an individual level , camille paglia nails it when she talks about the substantial power of women over men , qua males , based on women 's power to close their legs . 2 ) where does your concept of linguistic markedness come from , and on what basis do you establish a cause-effect relationship between patriarchy and markedness in pronouns ? my own idea of markedness is based on the original exposition as seen formulated by jakobson and trubetzkoy about 1930 ( see _ on language _ , roman jakobson , ed . linda r . waugh , 1990 . chapter 8 ) . a conclusion opposite to yours ( and gender feminists ) seems evident from the original formulation . their concept of "" the mark "" grew out of interest in binary aspects of language , like past / present , long / short . trubetzkoy wrote , "" only one of the terms of a correlation is perceived as actively modified and as positively possessing some mark , while the other term is perceived as lacking the mark and as passively unmodified "" ( p136 ) . this suggests to me that "" woman "" and "" she "" are "" species "" terms which females "" have "" as an exclusive and special privilege , whereas males do not have a "" species "" name exclusively their own , but instead must suffer to share a "" genus "" designation . it is for this reason i prefer sometimes to call the masculine unmarked words "" tautonyms "" ( i . e . , in biology , one name for both species and genus ) . the editor of the book goes on to comment on the concept : "" thus , the general meaning of _ lion _ , in contradistinction to that of _ lioness _ , implies no sexual specification - - and only the * basic meaning * of _ lion _ prompted by informative contexts suggests a sexual specification : e . g . , _ lions and lionesses _ "" . is n't this saying that man qua male emerges only in contexts that contrast him with the female ? otherwise , he is a generic ( genus , genre ) person and accordingly unmarked - - i . e . , "" just "" a person . the jakobson book continues , "" the constraining , focusing character of the marked term of any grammatical opposition is directed toward a more narrowly specified and delimited conceptual item "" . if men wanted to throw a testy beef about it , they could say , "" how come the gals have exclusive words , but the guys have to share theirs with everybody else ? "" 3 ) finally , you propose that in all past history they ' ve had "" no concept of sex equality "" . there is an inherent chronocentrism ( my term ) in your indictment , but , notwithstanding , i ' m somewhat sure you ' re talking about "" rights "" . "" rights "" , equal or otherwise , is a modern concept that is often muddled and sometimes useless if one considers , as i do , that the more important ends of life are happiness , inner peace , and freedom from fear - - what good are abstract rights if one is miserable all the time ? . the extremely important distinction is too often lost sight of between concepts of inherent rights and entitlement rights . if we discuss "" women 's equality "" and "" men 's equality "" without talking about documents like the universal declaration of human rights , the united states constitution , the code of hammurabi , etc . , or sources of rights , like god or the barrel of a gun , we are not going to get anywhere . if we take into account considerations of class , age , history , geography , etc . , i would argue that on a de facto level , women have had , and continue to have , collectively , an advantage over men . i know that saying so will upset a few of us , even give some of us a little gas and heartburn , my being the direct precipitation of which i apologize for in advance . best regards , jeffrey

shor,"the revival of the shor literaly language . irina nevskaya , mainz . summary the article is devoted to the present-day sociolinguistic situation in mountain shoriya ( russia , the south of western siberia , the kemerovo region ) . the indigenous population of mountain shoriya are the shors who speak one of the siberian turkic languages . the shor language has survived in spite of unfavourable circumstances . until very recently , it was neither written nor taught at school for half a century . at present , the shors try to restore social functions to the language . the turcological traditions at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute have facilitated ( and even instigated ) the revival of the shor literary language . the article touches upon the history of literary shor and of shor language research in novokuznetsk , and analyzes recent developments in shoriya : the revival of shor language school teaching , and of written shor . special attention is paid to problems facing shor turcologists who were providing the revival process with scientific back-up . the article will be fully published in one of the next issues of the journal turkic languages here we present some extracts of it . general information the shors are one of the minor indigenous turkic peoples of siberia . in the former ussr there were slightly over 16 , 000 shors . 12 , 585 of them , according to the census of 1989 , lived in kuzbass ( the kemerovo region ) , in the south of western siberia [ itogi 1989 , 42 ] . . . the shors inhabit mountain shoriya , the northern part of the sayan - altay mountain region . the ethnonym was introduced by the academician v . v . radlov at the end of the nineteenth century . the ethnonym , which came to be used officially , was originally the name of one of the turkic family clans or tribes ( sooks ) who spoke rather similar turkic dialects . the turks of altay also used the terrn ' shor ' for the turkic - speaking population of the kondoma ( shor lfondumj , mrassu ( shor pras ) and tom ( shor tom ) river basins . at that time , this population did not have a general native name . as the official and native name oftthis ethnos , the ethnonym spread in the mid - 1 ^ 30 's , during the beginning of the national cansolidation of the turkic sayan - altay ethnic groups . the ethnic group formed from various turkic and non - turkic sources . the ethnonym ' aba ' , the name of one of tolax sooks , is encountered in chinese sources dating from 603 [ pritsak 1959 , 630 ] . the shors are considered to be turkicized ob - ugrians : linguistic , ethnographic and anthropological research shows thz presence of an ob - ugric substratum in the ethnos : in the toponymy of shoriya there are a lot of ket names ( e . g . the river names ending in * zas / + sas ) , indicating that the region was inhabited earlier by the kets . many questions of shor ethnic history have not yet been solved . as a separate nation with selfidentification and national sentiment , it formed within the turkic - speaking population of this region during the last three centuries . the shor ethnologist dr . valery kimeev delineates 3 periods of the ethnos history [ kimeev 1994 , 4 - 6 ] . 1 . the formation of territorial ethnic groups of the shors within the administrative ethnic territory ( russian kuzneckij uezd ) , from the beginning of the seventeenth until the beginning of the twentieth century . 2 . national and cultural consolidation in the framework of the autonomous national district ( cor / lo-swo / skij nacional ' nyj / ajon ) , 1926 - 1939 . at that time , the processes of national development were very intensive . the most important contributing factors were the development of the literary language , school instruction in shor and the spreading of literacy among the shor population . 3 . from the early 1940 's until very recently , the shor nation in the conditions of active spreading of the dominant russian culture . within these years the shors lost their literary language and were at the brink of full assimilation . socio - linguistic situation in shordya in the late 1980 's the shor language has survived despite unfavourable circumstances . the fast industrial development of the area in the twentieth century almost destroyed the traditional shor way of life and had a profound influence on the area . the mass inflow of mainly russian speaking migrants initiated assimilation processes which threatened not only the shor language but also the very existence of the shor nation . beginning in the 1950 's , the following new economic and social factors emerged : small farms were merged , and many shor villages disappeared ; people , in search of work , had to move to cities ( where the processes of assimilation moved even faster ) ; the rural population was reduced , the urban population in mountainshoriya grew ; schools in small shor villages were closed ; shor boarding schools were opened ( these were primary and secondary educational establishments in big villages and industrial centers where shor children lived apart from their families during the academic year and were instructed in russian ) . as a result , by the end of the 1980 's , shor came to have a lower social status it was not a written language , nor a language of school education . furthermore , its transmission to younger generations had almost stopped , and the number of speakers had dramatically diminished . the language competence of speakers was reduced , especially of urban shors ( only 3 % of urban shors could speak shor fluently in 1986 versus 20 . 1 % in 1976 ) , while their competence in russian increased . in 1989 only 59 . 4 % of the shors considered shor to be their mother tongue , versus 76 . 6 % in 1970 . the number of shors who considered russian to be their mother tongue increased from 24 . 4 % up to 39 . 1 % [ itogi , 1989 , 42 ] . we see that people preferred to give up their mother tongue . the history of the shor literary language is important for the analysis of the factors which led to this situation . general information on the history of the shor litera / y language shor could be called one of the "" oppressed languages "" of the former ussr . within the twentieth century alone , the shor language lost its literary tradition twice . the first time was just after the october revolution in russia , when the church schools founded by the altay missionaries were closed . the altay missionaries preached in the native languages of siberia 's aborigines . they published books in indigenous languages of the siberian people , founded primary , secondary schools , and religious tertiary schools where they trained national priests and teachers for shor schools . one of the first primary schools in shoriya was opened in the village of kuzedeevo by the wellknown missionary and linguist v . 1 . verbitsky who taught at this school . by the time of the october revolution there were schools in all the larger villages . in the northern part of shoriya , about 40 % of the population was literate . shor was the language of school teaching , written communication , literature . the shor literature of the time was sparse ; there were only shor translations of religious literature , and original works . after 1917 , with the outbreak of the revolution and civil war , all schools were closed , and hence the literary tradition was interrupted . in 1927 the shor national district was formed . though the district did not exist long ( it was annulled in 1939 ) , this was an important period for the development of the shortliterary language . it was taught at schools ; a considerable number of books in shor were published ( more th , an 150 titles ) and the language , folklore and ethnology of the shors were studied intensively . however , the tragic events of 1937-45 had a devastating effect on the culture of the shors . in 1942 , the last issue of the shor language newspaper "" kyzl sor "" ( ' red shoriya ' ) was published , and all the shor schools closed . frqm this time on , the shor language was no longer written or taught at schools for half a century . the sphere of its functioning was minimal : it was only used at home for everyday topics . all other cultural needs were met by russian , which was the language of education , of literary works , of the mass media , as well as of administrative , political , and economic relations . during this period , several generations of urban shors grew up with at best minimal competence in shor . at present , history gives the shor language a chance ( probably the last one ) to become a literary language . the active growth of shor national sentiment and political activity , their interest in the national culture and language , and changes in the country as a whole can contribute to this . the revival of literary shor began with the publishing of textbooks of shor , the training of shor language teachers , and the teaching of shor at schools and in shor language circles . the revival of teaching shor at schools in 1988 , a chair of the shor language and literature was created at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute ( ngpi ) . the first head was prof . andrey chudoyakov . the same year a shor department was established in the faculty of philology and teacher training in shor language and literature began . a year later , teachers of different subjects who were shors themselves began to teach shor in a number of schools . they were graduates of a 2 - year course of training leaders for shor language circles . the course was organized in novokuznetsk by dr . alisa esipova . the shor alphabet book and textbooks for the primary years were written by dr . nadezhda kurpeshko ( kemerovo ) and members of the department . in 1994 , the first graduates of the national department ( 5 people ) began to work at schools in the kemerovo region . at present , about 20 teachers of shor work at schools in the tashtagol and mezhdurechensk districts of mountain shoriya , both in cities and villages . some schools which were closed 10-30 years ago resumed teaching . some schools were rebuilt . turcology in novokuznetsk the revival process was facilitated ( or , perhaps , even instigated ) by turcological traditions at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute . during the 50 crucial years of shor language history , the collecting , compiling and describing of all still available material has not stopped . the shor language research has been carried out mainly by university foreign-language teachers at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute . when in late eighties we witnessed the uprise of shor national sentiment and the desire to restore social functions to the language , there had already been qualified people ( among them also shors ) who could cope with this task . initially , the most important task facing such linguists was to provide the revival process with scientific back-up : to create a modern orthography for shor , to choose a standard dialect , and to work out literary norms . references itogi vsesojuznoj perepisi naselenija 1989 goda . vypusk 4 . nacional ' nyj sostav . 1990 . kemerovo : kemerovskoe kniznoe izdatel 's tvo . patruseva , g . m . 1994 . sovremennye etniceskie processy u sorcev . in : kimeev , v . m . & lavrent ' eva , l . a . & tokmasev , j . k . & sogrina , n . a . & bobrov , v . v . & nevskaja , i . a . & tivjakov , s . d .

the lexicogrammar of adjectives : a systemic functional approach to lexis,"tucker , gordon h ( cardiff university ) ; the lexicogrammar of adjectives : a systemic functional approach to lexis ; published by cassell ; hb . : 0 304 33903 2 ; us $ 75 . 00 / 50 . 00 adjectives are the third most important class of words ( after verbs and nouns ) , yet this is the first book-length study in english of this central grammatical category . in it english adjectives are described within a framework which unifies semantics and syntax ; this has important implications for the modelling of lexis in general . it has long been a principle of systemic functional linguistics - the theory in which the description is set - that lexis should be treated , in halliday 's words , as ' most delicate grammar ' . until now , this challenging concept has never been explored and tested for more than a few small areas of lexis . the research reported here is the first large-scale test of this hypothesis . after a thorough survey of the relevant literature , gordon tucker provides a linguistic description of the meanings and forms of the adjectives themselves , the structures that occur around them , and the funtions that such units perform as elements of other units ( such as the clause and the nominal group ) . the lexicogrammar of adjectives constitutes a major descriptive additon to our knowledge of the value of ' lexis as most delicate grammar ' . it is a major contribution to the theoretical modelling of language in general and of words in particular . its conclusions are important both for systemic functional linguistics and for linguistic theory in general . available for review . email : sales @ cassellexport . demon . co . uk

re : 6 . 176 sum - c gemination,"reply to : re ) 6 . 176 sum : c gemination ( syntactic ) afterthought on gemination - - sorry to come in late on the discussion . the summary notes the celtic "" mutation "" called "" gemination "" in works such thurneysen 's grammar of old irish . one should not be too quick to call it that . subsequent work has shown that mostly this meant the absence of lenition or nasalization , not an actual twinning ( . i . doubling ) of the sound . this is the vestige of ( common celtic or pre - irish ) - c [ - nasal ] # # c - - boundaries , as opposed to those which caused lenition ( - v # # c - - ) and nasalization ( - c [ + nasal ] # # c - - ) . nasalization was ( is ) realized as the voicing of unvoiced initial stops , and the nasalization of voiced stops , with variations too ornate to go into here . note that in old irish , various kinds of subordination were marked very often by the lenition or nasalization of the initial consonant of the initial word of the clause ( usu . a verb , of course ) . see thurneysen for an exhaustive display of the facts . i cannot speak for mod . breton , but my impression is that the brythonic situation largely reflects a similar "" system "" .

"re : 5 . 1500 comparative method , polarization & reviews","i am forwarding the following for posting at the request of robert rankin ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . unkans . edu ) . i do not subscribe to this list and have no wish to join the fray at present , but when my name is mentioned sometimes the file is forwarded to me via e-mail . thus the following : andy anderson cites me on three points in a series of recent postings . i have known andy upwards of 30 years and do not feel that he would in - tentionally misrepresent my views , but i also feel a couple of things need clarification . first , i am uncomfortable about being formally cited as a ( secondary ) source of information on lyle campbell 's paper from the boulder ( green - berg ) conference of ca . 1990 . if andy wishes to distribute an attack on the paper or its author in written form , he should first obtain an actual copy of it or , alternatively , await its publication . i guess i should n't have brought it up in our conversation at the ssila / aaa meetings . second , i am said to have reported that the geneticists who have studied the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) of sundry native american and siberian peo - ples claim that there were / are "" two subgroups within amerind ( aside from the eskimo and athabaskans ) . "" this is not what i ( or the paper 's authors wallace , torroni and schurr , et al . ) said . the authors did not address themselves to the linguistic problems and most certainly did n't talk about "" subgroups "" . nor did i , since i do not regard the historicity of anything like "" amerind "" as even remotely established . the authors of the paper did posit at least four "" migrations "" . they do not discuss the most recent , eskomo - aleut , in their abstract , but i think they gave a time depth figure of about 6000 years bp ( before present ) for it orally - - do n't quote me . from their abstract : for what they call na - dene their figure is 7000-10000 years bp . then they say they have evidence for at least two "" migrations "" preceding that . one comes between 12000-15000 bp and the earliest between 26000-34000 bp . figures as high as 40000 bp were mentioned orally , as i recall . they did not attempt to correlate their figures with our knowledge of periods of glaciation or the periodic existence of the land bridge in beringia . i leave it to readers to decide what this portends for the amerind hypo - thesis or its proposed ( glotto ) chronology , but a warning is in order in any event . note that i have written "" migration "" in quotes above . this is not because i wish to pejorate the term ; it is because geneticists use it in a very special way . for them it has to do solely with the ap - pearance of specific genetic material in american populations . they then assume a common ancestor and calculate the number of millennia by positing a uniform mutation rate for mtdna . the material and theories they work with force this definition of migration on them . all this says nothing about the situation "" on the ground . "" in reality though , each of these genetic migrations can have included many distinct movements of people across beringia over a great many years - - perhaps centuries or even millennia . and they may have represented many ling - guistic groups . all that is required in order for entire clusters of migrations "" on the ground "" to get read as a single mtdna "" migration "" is a relatively homogeneous gene pool in eastern siberia over the particular time span when the "" genetic mutation "" occurred . the evidence does indeed suggest four genetic migrations , but it really says little or nothing about how many "" real "" migrations there were with - in each of the four clusters , nor does it say anything about linguistic diversity - - much less "" subgroups of amerind . "" we may wish it did , but it does n't . i do note with interest however the rough correlation between the geneticists ' oldest figures and the calculations of nichols ( 1990 in language 66 . 3 ) based on linguistic diversity in the western hemisphere . the more recent sets of mtdna dates fall within the esta - blished archaeological ballpark for clovis believers , although the earliest set certainly does not . one very short contribution of my own here - - mostly my wife 's actually , since she is a molecular geneticist and we talk about these things over breakfast . the yardstick used by mtdna geneticists in these cal - culations may not be appreciably better than that used in glottochrono - logy , i . e . , genetic mutation takes place at a rate which is only rela - tively constant . it can be speeded up by various singular events from cosmic ray bombardment to ingesting certain fungi infecting the grain from your cache pit . biologists try to allow for this sort of thing , but as you can see from the plus / minus dates for each cluster , we are not talking about something as precise as dendrochronology or even radiocarbon dating . the mtdna studies are very interesting but we must bear in mind their limitations and special use of the term "" migration "" . lastly , in an earlier posting andy mentions that i had examined green - berg 's notebooks and determined how he had mislabeled so much of his siouan data in lia . andy 's description of the way the notebooks are laid out is correct , but i have only actually seen xeroxes of the pages of siouan entries , not the notebooks themselves . i might add that the siouan entries in the notebook are hard by the iroquoian , caddoan , yuchi entries demonstrating once again that greenberg had decided on the final classification of these families when he laid out his notebook design and before the vocabularies from the languages were entered . my thanks to john koontz for posting this . sincerely , bob rankin ( university of kansas ) ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . ukans . edu )

"re : 8 . 792 , disc : grammar in uk schools - - a response","i was fascinated by geoffrey sampson 's defense of traditional educational language standards , and cannot resist commenting on some points . he says : it seems to me that teaching correct usage , the > standard terminology for elements of grammar and punctuation , and the > ability to remedy formal errors in faulty prose are exactly the kinds > of thing that need to be taught in this area at secondary-school > level . to say that school pupils should be taught to engage in > "" explicit , systematic reflection on what it is that we are doing when > we use language "" strikes me as akin to suggesting that teachers of > french should forget about teaching the past participle of "" vivre "" in > favour of getting their pupils to develop considered opinions about > the theories of derrida . even assuming this type of cognitive > achievement is worthwhile in principle , it is quite impractical for > the average secondary-school class to attain it . setting aside the possible implication of elitism in the phrase "" the * average * secondary-school class "" , i view the charge of "" impracticality "" with suspicion , since it is a typical way of dismissing any innovation . it means "" it 's very nice but there 's no time for it . we have already identified the priorities , and we ' re having trouble getting them through in the time we have . "" cf . we have no time or money to investigate the "" so-called "" causes of crime , because there 's so much of it that we can hardly keep up with the demand for more prisons - - that 's the top priority - no time for anything else , thanks anyway . nevertheless , in principle i was not put off , and read on to find out why the top priorities are what they are . i was not disappointed , though the rationale offered seemed predictable to me , and also arguable . > people need to learn to write their national language accurately > because much of modern life depends on complex written communication , > and prose that is full of unsystematic deviations from the conventions > interferes with successful communication , as dirty windows interfere > with successful vision - - the message gets lost amid problems with the > medium . people need a terminology for talking about the bits and > pieces of language , as a car mechanic needs to know the names of the > parts of a motor , in order to provide an apparatus for thinking out > what has gone wrong and how to cure it when prose does n't "" work "" . this all sounds reasonable . and i am indeed in favor of students knowing these things . in fact , prescriptive grammatical terminology and analysis do set a foundation even for what linguists do when they "" engage in explicit , systematic reflection on what it is that we are doing when we use language "" namely , linguists start with the traditional categories , explore their motivations and then discuss where they seem to be inadequate and what would be more adequate , in view of whatever larger linguistic facts are brought to bear on whatever problem of traditional grammar . . . i realise , of course , that geoff is not arguing for this - - and so i wonder if traditional grammatical analysis etc . is either necessary or sufficient for effective "" complex communication "" . probably nobody would defend the "" sufficient "" condition in view of much obscure , if not incomprehensible , ( though "" grammatically "" flawless ) standard writing , but i also wonder about the necessary "" condition "" . that is , do you have to be able to analyse to imitate the standard way of writing ? is the standard that different from a "" natural "" language ( first learned type ) ? ( at least with some good , also professional , creative writers i know , they are not actually aware of some of the key elements of their style , e . g . , one who is very effective in using and even coining nominal compounds , but did not show recognition of this as a characteristic of his style when i mentioned it to him . ) thus , i am not challenging the notion of a standard or necesarily the demand for its use in certain contexts , but how it is presented , esp . is it this great logical thing it 's generally portrayed as , that 's gonna solve all those "" communication "" problems that have alarmed english publishers since the time of caxton ? but even more , does it have to be * explicitly * taught ? ( maybe a lot of teachers screw up teaching "" grammar "" , because that 's where a lot of students complain they get irremediably bored and just want to get the hell out of the classroom . who knows , even linguistics might be more popular , if many students had n't earlier been turned off to "" grammar "" . ) > beyond that , though , teaching orthography and grammar at school level > has a much broader educational value . one of the lessons we all have > to learn is that nothing big and worthwhile is ever achieved in this > life without careful attention to endless tedious and often arbitrary > details . i can't see a better domain for learning this lesson than > the orthography and grammar of one 's national language : it contains > the tedious details , but it relates to material which surrounds the > child in his everyday life . this is the discipline and "" moral fibre "" argument , which is the last ditch attempt at enforcing authoritarianism . as a friend of mine , an english teacher observed , his supervisor is an ambitious man , and a stickler for discipline . night school students should not wear hats in class , says the supervisor . so my friend the teacher told one recalcitrant student that once ( these are night school adults ) . the student took it off and put it right back on . my friend said . that 's it . i ' m here to teach english . he 's not bothering anybody else . i ' m not going to get sucked into some authority game . but school for children is full of such petty discipline things that are insisted upon along with learning "" subjects "" . obediance is more important than understanding . the argument is that the discipline that comes from obedience will lead to understanding in time , if there is any argument at all , cf . learning declensions and conjugations before approaching texts . ( and often the teachers do n't even know why something is insisted on . they just know that they have to be obeyed , or else the authoritarian structure collapses , and their supervisors will come down on them . ) this is what lots of kids resent about school . probably not the same ones who actually like to cause disturbances ( or can't control themselves somehow ) . is anyone unfamiliar from their childhood with what i ' m referring to ? so what basically is this "" discipline "" argument . it seems to me the argument is : the student who has mastered standard english has demonstrated ability ( not necessarily inclination ) to follow relatively complex orders and routines , and therefore can be considered capable for positions in hierarchies where following fairly complex orders is considered necessary ( or at least desirable ) . little wonder some actually call this behavioral skill "" morality "" . but can i question geoff 's rationale without questioning his view of "" ( british ) civilization "" ( that 's a quote from his message ) ? i do n't know . - - benji

sum . : history of capitalisation in english,"back in late january / early february i posted a query to linguist about sources on the history of capitalisation in english . several people responded asking me to post a summary to the list on any replies i might receive . my apologies for the delay , but i have been fighting three different winter "" bugs "" ( some viral , some bacterial ) since my original posting , and then had to rush to catch up on acadaemic commitments before the end of term ! anyway , here is the summary . . . . the most immediate "" success "" reply , so to speak , came from david denison at u . of manchester , u . k . : mrcepdd @ fsl . art . man . ac . uk . david suggested the following article : osselton , noel ( 1985 ) ' spelling - book rules and the capitalization of nouns in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ' . in arn , mary - jo and hanneke wirtjes ( eds . ) . * * historical and editorial studies in medieval and modern english : for johan gerritsen . * * wolters - noordhoff , groningen , pp . 49-61 . to my delight , i found that "" my "" university library ( knight lib . at the u . of oregon ) had precisely this volume . the article ( chapter ) is only 6 pages long , but contains as well a list of spelling books and grammars , etc . to which osselton referred in the text . there is also a page of notes . this reference is the most useful i have yet seen , and i will be using it ( when i have the time ) as a foundation for finding more info . on this topic . a good place to start , i think . a reply from john e . koontz ( koontz @ bldr . nist . gov ) pointed me towards usenet lists which , i regret , i have not yet been able to try . john suggests comp . fonts , or hte repositories of past usenet postings ( he is not sure where they are ) , or the usenet faq collections . also , comp . text . larry rosenwald ( lrosenwald @ wellesley . edu ) suggested looking into the literature of printing history , as he reminded me that "" in fact capitalization was often regularized by the printer .

( and as a final parting shot , so to speak , i would like to point out that in english writing we use a capital letter for the 1st . p . s . in all environments , but not for any other person ! why ? was this a printing influence too ( e . g . , to distinguish it from small "" i "" in roman numerals ? ) . ) from talking to a local professor , russian , for instance , ( if i remember correctly ) , does not have this distinction . how about other language writing systems , european or not ? and what effect does this english pattern have on us psychologically ? in the sense that "" i "" is more important than "" you , them "" etc . ? ) . once again , thank-you to all respondents . i look forward to discussion , if any , on my questions - - either post to list or to me directly . regards to all , anthea . * * "" words do n't mean , people mean . . . .

sum : function words,"i . the question and its motivation three weeks ago or so , i asked linguist readers to help me find examples of function words with unusually specific meanings . this was meant to elicit examples that i could mention in a paper called "" the formal semantics of grammaticalization "" , where i discuss what happens to the meaning of a content morpheme that develops into a function morpheme . i argue there , developing work by other semanticists / logicians , that ( 1 ) function morphemes do have meanings ( contrary to a widespread assumption ) . just consider that the meanings of quantifiers , tense , aspect , modals , etc . are the bread and butter of us working semanticists . ( 2 ) there is a class of "" logical "" meanings that have certain formal properties ( permutation-invariance , high types ) . ( 3 ) unfortunately , there is no perfect correlation between logical meanings and functional morphemes . there are lexical / content morphemes with ( almost ) logical meanings ( adjectives "" same "" , "" mere "" , "" alleged "" , verbs "" deny "" , "" believe "" , nouns "" majority "" , etc . ) . and there might be functional morphemes with non-logical meanings ( hence the linguist query ) . ( 4 ) thus there is not much that we can say about what happens to the meaning of a morpheme that is becoming grammaticalized . although i make some presumably doomed efforts . the finished paper ( which is based on a talk i gave at the nels 25 workshop on language change ) will appear in the nels 25 proceedings ( to be available from the glsa at umass amherst , glsa @ linguist . umass . edu ) . the paper is downloadable by anonymous ftp from the following url : ftp : / / broca . mit . edu / pub / fintel / gramma . ps i would welcome any comments . ii . some of the responses : mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) wrote : ) the reference [ to the pejorative pronouns "" you shit "" ] ) is samuel elbert 's grammar of ) rennellese / bellona , "" echo of a culture : a grammar ) of rennell and bellona "" , uhawaii press 1988 ) [ oceanic linguistics special publication no . 22 ] . ) ) a few interesting cases of ) grammaticalization of a somewhat relevant ) type do exist . in micronesian languages ) there are a set of verbal affixes for ) directionality ( up , down , towards speaker , ) towards hearer , towards some third ) party [ the usual deixis system ] ) which ) also include "" toward the open ocean "" ) and "" toward the lagoon "" ; whereas ( of course ) ) if you want to say "" toward john 's house "" ) ( or some other nonce collocation ) ) you need to use a pp . ) ) similar , but probably not similar enough , ) is the bizarre use of the cardinal directionals ) in icelandic documented in a classic paper ) by einar haugen ( i can dig up the reference ) if you really want it ) . it seems like , being ) predominantly coastal inhabitants , and having ) a rather uneven fjorded coastline , to go ) to a city which was north of you actually ) involved heading out in a southerly ) direction ( all that time ) .

"" with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to "" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to "" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull . . . "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps "" a "" through "" f "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 4 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . in addition you will be provided with information on internet marketing clubs such as internet marketing resources ( imr ) : this is one the premiere internet marketing clubs on the internet . this club provides a forum where internet marketers from all over the world can exchange ideas and secrets on internet marketing . in addition , this club specializes in providing free internet marketing tools and services for the do - yourself - internet - marketer . they will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 1 , 000 , 000 fresh e-mail addresses each week . this club will provide you with hundreds of free resources which include : how to obtain free web sites , how to obtain top rankings in search engines for your web-site , how to send bulk e-mail into aol and compuserve , how to market your products on newsgroups , free classified ads , electronic malls , bulletin boards , banner ads and much more . imr ' s web address is : http : / / www . ixpres . com / imrs / marketing1 . htm ( not working . . . check the links below ) http : / / www . onlinemlm . com / http : / / www . promlm . com / resources / index . shtml there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash !

dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free !

new book : cognitive linguistics,"the new psychology of language cognitive and functional approaches to language structure edited by michael tomasello , emory university the history of psychological approaches to the study of language has included periods of little communication between the disciplines of linguistics and psychology , and periods where each field drew upon the theories and methods of the other in limited - - and often limiting - - ways . this book represents a new approach that may define the next era in the relationship between psychology and linguistics . it does so by presenting the evolving linguistic theories collectively known as cognitive - functional linguistics in terms that are intended to be accessible to cognitive scientists interested in how language works psychologically . in contrast to the chomskian linguistic theories with which most psychologists today are familiar , the cognitive-functional approach of these linguists focuses on the things people communicate about ( communicative functions ) and the social conventions by means of which they do so ( linguistic symbols and structures ) . the chapters in this book were all written by linguists who are leading proponents of this approach and edited by a psychologist committed to bringing this new way of looking at language into the mainstream of psychology . the volume promises to give psychologists a new appreciation of what this variety of linguistics can offer their study of language and communication , as well as to provide cognitive-functional linguists new models for presenting their work to audiences outside the boundaries of traditional linguistics . 0-8058 - 2576 - 2 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 65 . 00 0-8058 - 2577 - 0 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 29 . 95 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com

"we know you needed this , so . . . .","greetings , this email is about fighting spam , and winning . > > please forward to your friends , family and co-workers to people that want to get spam out of their email : read this , you ' ll like what i am doing . . . . : ) to people that want to flame me for whatever reason : do n't be an egomaniac , i have a right to free speech , and the right to say it to a lot of people , so buzz off . - - - - - first let me tell you who i am and what i do . my name is robert young , i live in moscow , idaho , u . s . a . , and i have been using the internet since 1990 . i have watched the internet go from a small community of serious professionals to a roaring civilization of over 100 million people . until 8 months ago i had been a private investigator specializing in the apprehension of criminal fugitives . after 8 years of doing that i started getting burned out and decided to turn my life long hobby of programming computers into a full time job . now i write specialized applications for investigating and locating information on the internet . this summer , during the last week of july , i finally got fed up with the fact that i could not seem to get my 5 year old email address off of spam lists . i would reply to their emails with the word "" remove "" like most of them say and the next day i would get more . i sent my email address to remove lists , complained to administrators , postmasters , and my friends . none of it seemed to make a bit of difference . i decided to investigate the bulk email business . what i found made me so angry i almost blew a fuse . did you know : 1 . spammers steal valid email addresses and use them for return addresses . you could get the blame ! 2 . spammers purposely deceive filters designed to protect your email address . 3 . spammers "" hijack "" mail servers that are meant to relay messages from computer to computer . when they overload these servers , your legitimate email can be lost ! 4 . congress is not going to pass any laws in the united states anytime in the near future to stop this garbage , and they may never do so . some members of congress have actually campaigned through email . ( does that - really - surprise you ? ) 5 . when spammers register domain names with internic they never pay their bills because they know that the domain will be blocked and useless within 30 days , and interring gives them that long to pay before cutting them off . 6 . some spammers buy lists of accounts from hackers that have broken into internet service providers and use these accounts , that belong to other people , so they can connect to the internet without being concerned about losing the account . again , you get the blame , you lose your account . most of these spammers are genuine , authentic , certified jerks . i decided to get even , i took all of this very personally . within 3 weeks , the spam had dropped to a trickle . now i only get 2 or 3 a week instead of 7 or 8 each day . update : as of 02-oct - 1998 i have not gotten a single spam for 5 days . that 's a fact . i am starting to get comments from people that joined me two weeks ago that have noticed drops in their spam count of as much as 70 % . that is a fact as well . my list of active spammers is over 80 individuals now and it is growing every day . it does n't take government intervention , we all know that our government could n't feed a cat without spending $ 400 on a bag of cat food and starting 8 committees . what it does take is someone with the guts to take action , now ! what did i do ? first i recognized that spammers are not going to just quit , they make too much money doing it . the self righteous "" anti-spammers "" only wipeout mostly innocent business people with poor judgment . they have not put a single spam mailer out of business yet . not a one ! they just pop up with a different domain name , and dialup account the next day . the anti spammers have actually wiped out several potentially successful remove lists . you know why ? they do n't want it to end because then they would n't have a crusade anymore . think i ' m kidding ? i know who the anti-spammers are as well and believe me , their motivations are purely egotistical . in my opinion they have made spam worse by driving it underground and ruining the web based remove lists . try to go to www . remove-list . com , it is n't there anymore . so i am doing it different . human nature matters . . . i used my investigative experience to hunt down the - actual people - that were sending me spam . names , phone numbers , addresses , etc . it was n't easy but i had the background and knowledge to do it . i called each of these people and told them that if they did not immediately cease and desist sending mail to my address that i was going to give their name , address , phone number and anything else i had on them to every service provider in the country . that i would publish their information on the internet via the web , and that i would give their information to every ( legitimate ) anti - spam group i could find . i was polite and adult about the issue but i made it very clear that i was dead serious . nothing else has worked . people have been trying to get rid of spam for several years with no success . this method works ! ! ! if i told you i could do the same thing for you would you be interested ? i thought so . here is what you need to do : first : start your text editor ( notepad , vi , whatever ) second : type the following information and print it . first name last name primary email address ( remember your email may have two forms such as : joe @ isp . com and joe @ mail . isp . com . include both , contact your isp if you are n't sure ) family member ' s addresses ( one per line please ! ) third : mail this information to me : robert young attn : no more spam please ! ! ! c / o super fast services 116 e . 3rd . st . suite 206 moscow , id 83843 we need donations to support this fight . i started out doing this for friends and family , then their friends and family , and now it is starting to cost us a lot of money . please include a donation of five dollars either a five dollar bill , or a check made out to me . we are hoping that there are enough decent people out there that appreciate what we are doing and will pitch in a few bucks to help us pay for the phone calls , computer time , database searches , and hiring people to do the data entry for the 600 plus letters we are getting every day . p l e a s e h e l p ! i guarantee you will think it is the best five bucks you have ever spent if you are sick of spam . thanks for taking the time to reply to this letter , i hope to hear from you soon . working together we can defeat unwanted spam for good .

"esther torrego , the dependencies of objects","for more information please visit http : / / mitpress . mit . edu / promotions / books / tordpf98 the dependencies of objects esther torrego this monograph investigates the nature , properties , and consequences of the grammatical constraints that yield overt marking of objects in a variety of languages . the author , working within the minimalist program , concentrates on the syntactic and semantic behaviors of a particular class of objects : objects morphologically marked by the dative preposition in romance languages , especially in several spanish dialects , with consideration of similar phenomena in other languages . the central questions addressed revolve around the syntactic derivations that have accusative and dative complements and the role played by "" doubling "" clitics in these derivations . the analysis , concerned primarily with case theory , unifies syntactic phenomena by isolating the grammatical factors that yield structures with accusative and dative objects . the monograph also includes a discussion of some classical themes of syntactic theory in the romance languages , including asymmetries in the wh-movement of objects with clitics , and causatives . esther torrego is professor of spanish and linguistics at the university of massachusetts , boston . linguistic inquiry monograph 34 september 1998 6 x 9 , 216 pp . paper , isbn 0-262 - 70068 - 9 ; cloth , isbn 0-262 - 20112 - 7

linguistics and imperialism,"it 's probably true that linguistics tends to thrive in circumstances of imperialism , but the reason is not that linguistics is inherently imperialistic by nature . when does linguistics happen ? when a society with a literate culture comes into contact with peoples speaking other languages , and takes an interest in them . imperialism provides one situation in which this can occur , but not the only one . bob hoberman rhoberman @ ccmail . sunysb . edu

"semantics : m . honcoop , dynamic excursions on weak islands","from holland academic graphics dynamic excursions on weak islands by martin honcoop dynamic excursions on weak island investigates the phenomenon of weak islands within the framework of dynamic semantics . weak islands are contexts that are transparent with respect to some , though not all quantificational dependencies that involve an operator and a variable-expression . specifically , this book explores the consequences of the novel claim that weak islands reduce to the same principles of dynamic semantics that account for inaccessibility . in addition , it examines in both empirical and theoretical terms the precise relationship between the dynamic theory of weak islands and the algebraic semantic approach developed by szabolcsi & zwarts ( 1993 ) . this inquiry leads to a number of further developments of dynamic semantics , such as an intensional version of existential disclosure and an algorithm for computing the dynamic properties of an expression on the basis of its boolean properties . contents : 1 . preamble : a semantic account of weak islands 2 . a dynamic semantics 3 . dynamic binding across weak islands algaebraic versus dynamic perspectives on weak islands 5 . summary and conclusions 1998 . xx + 218 pp . isbn : 90 5569 056 2 . paperback .

""" linguist / - ician "" : a new slant .","i have been quite happy so far to sit back and let the discourse about the relative merits of the terms "" linguist "" and "" linguistician "" unfold unhampered by any intervention from me . i am , first and foremost , a lover of language ( s ) ; a person who studies language ( s ) , their history and their "" idiosyncrasies "" . i call myself a "" linguist "" . i might add that i do not myself fully understand the theories propounded by those who call themselves "" linguist [ ician ] s "" ( in the sense of someone engaged in "" linguistics "" , that is ) , nor do i really care what precisely they choose to call themselves ( or their area of study ) . do "" physicists "" and "" physicians "" have the same argument , i wonder ? ! i doubt it . quite coincidentally of this discourse , enid wai - ching mok ( < enid @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu > ) circulated recently a questionnaire for information on the terms "" linguist "" and "" linguistics "" in various languages . i happened upon an entry in her summary supposedly explaining the two russian terms "" jazykoved "" ( linguist ) and "" jazykoznanie "" ( linguistics ) . these were offered by a certain woody mott also of < uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu > : they were so infelicitous in their detail and ill construed in their interpretation that i was impelled to reply to this entry and ( as a "" linguist "" ) correct certain misconceptions . allow me to summarise : notwithstanding the argument whether these words are current or not in russian , i think an explanation of their etymology may be of some use to the general discourse on the merits of "" linguist "" vs . "" linguistician "" . the word "" jazykoved "" is composed of 2 roots : "" jazyk "" , meaning "" tongue "" or "" language "" and "" ved "" , meaning "" knowledgeable person "" ( cognates for "" ved "" ( < old russian "" vedeti "" ( e = the vowel ' jat ' ) ) "" knowing person "" , pace woody mott , are sanskrit "" ve : da "" , gothic "" wait "" , and english "" wit "" ) . the "" - o - "" is here merely a link vowl . a suitable english calque on the russian term , therefore , would be "" tongue-wit "" . this , in turn , reminded me of an article some years ago in which "" saxonist "" terms were advanced in favour of "" latinate "" heresies in the english - speaking world . thus , we have foreword for "" preface "" ( the argument here goes back to 1842 ) ; bodeful for "" ominous "" ; birdlore for "" ornithology "" , etc . , etc . i ' m sure we are bounded only by time and our imaginations as to other suggestions . mindful of the fact that there are probably many among you who are staunch adherents of the "" latinate "" tradition , and not wishing in any way to alienate or belittle that corpus of english vocabulary , i should , nevertherless , like to propose two alternatives to "" linguist "" and "" linguistics "" based on the "" saxonist "" principles above . tongue-wit ( noun ) "" a person versed / skilled in [ the study of ] language ( s ) "" tongue-lore ( noun ) "" the study of language ( s ) "" i leave it to the individual "" linguist [ ician ] "" to choose whether these terms are suited to their own area of study . i think that the "" saxonist "" terms do have the advantage at least of smacking of down - to-earth prurience and a lack of self-importance . a similar term "" tonguester "" , suggested earlier , is an admirable alternative . i for one am quite happy to call myself a "" tongue-wit "" engaged in "" tongue - lore "" - - others , i hope , will follow and leave the "" linguist [ ician ] s "" to sort themselves out . tony hall . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * tony hall * * * department of russian language * * * university of birmingham * * * edgbaston tel : + 44 ( 0 ) 21 414 3227 * * * birmingham b15 2tt fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 21 414 5966 * * * united kingdom email : a . r . hall @ bham . ac . uk * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",0

bilingualism,"i ' m not sure why , but i was reluctant to post on the issue of us bilingualism . in any case , i feel obliged to say this as an educational linguist who has worked in esl and tangentially in bilingual ed teacher education . first of all , the entire notion that bilingual ed was , is , or could be ( designed as ) a method for introducing national plurilingualism is a nonstarter . therefore any debates about it using plurilingualism as argument get nowhere . in fact , with out a wish to flame anyone ( because i do n't think it was intentional ) the entire argument that we should stop bilingual ed because of its anti - english or anti-standard english agenda is of a kind very familiar to us in educational circles . it 's little different than what we hear from those who argue that proponents of progressive educational idea x ( e . g . whole langauge reading instruction , process writing , outcomes-based ed . ) are trying to bring down standards , undermine society , do something unamerican , and so on . it is essentially a rhetorical manipulation of the worst kind , based on false suppositions , and intended to push hot buttons . by saying this i am not defending bilingual ed or any other movement . however , i think these need to be debated on their educational merits . why is the argument a nonstarter ? admittedly , there are those in education who propose that students have the right to their own dialect language or what-have - you , and that they should n't have to learn standard english in school . however , they are largely involved in an academic exercise that takes place in the pages of journals of various sorts . they do not shape policy . the avowed purpose of the vast majority of bilingual ed programs is usually to ease a limited english proficient child into the mainstream . the idea is that if they take content area courses in their first language they will not fall behind while learning english . the programs contain esl components that supposedly will allow the kids to mainstream later . some programs do encourage native language literacy and continue classes native language classes throughout a child 's school career . some take very young english speaking kids and put them into these classes on an immersion basis . since usually older english speaking kids in other schools are trying , in theory , to learn the same language the immigrant kids are already fluent in , i fail to see what is controversial about that . it seems to be designed , in theory again , to encourage personal , not societal , bilingualism . the failings of bilingual ed , in places where it has failed , have more to do with poor educational practice than with policy . if kids are arriving at college after say five years in bilingual ed , and are entering esl programs , something did n't work right . to anyone remotely familiar with urban schools , that should hardly be a surprise . now , on a national level i think we should look at us bilingualism and forget about catalonia or the basque country for a moment . bilingualism in the us has endured over many generations in several situations : ( i ) tight - knit religious communities : hasidic jews who speak yiddish , old order amish , brethren , and mennonites , who speak their german dialects . ( ii ) groups who were overtaken , to put it nicely , by english speakers : the navajo and other indigenious peoples ; french creole speakers in louisiana , spanish in the southwest . ( iii ) isolated communities : gullah in south carolina and georgia . immigrants , it would seem , tend to assimilate linguistically over a few , typically very few generations . in spite of the myth that spanish - speakers are somehow different on this score , i think , it would be instructive to look at the case of new york , which is full of people young hispanics who cannot speak more than a few words of spanish - this in spite of continuing immigration from spanish - speaking countries . as a non - yiddish or hebrew speaking ashkanazi jew , i entirely understand this phenomenon although as a learner of spanish as a foreign language , i lament the lost opportunity . finally , i think it would be more instructive to look at which americans feel threatened by the non-existent threat of the demise of something that has never existed ( the us as a monolingual nation ) and try to figure out why people feel that way . why , for example , is it an issue in the west and not in new york ? why is it associated with right and not the left ? why has it come up now again ? is it it really just good old american nativism , ' 90s style , or is there something different going on ? also , why have n't we in linguistics and education done more to communicate with mainstream americans that the whole thing is a lot of nonsense ? michael newman dept . of educational theory & practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu

or can multimodal retrieval techniques be combined to create queries suitable for image , video and audio retrieval ? in general , a question is how can we create realistic queries for realistic systems . the third focus of this workshop is on evaluation techniques for multimedia retrieval . currently , most researchers are using the standard evaluation measures defined for text documents ; these need to be extended / modified for multimedia documents . there is also a high degree of subjectivity involved that needs to be addressed . we will focus on the following specific topics : - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction of modalities ( e . g . text , images ) in indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies for multimedia information . we have found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it . - techniques for relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms for multimodal queries - indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e . g extracting text from images , word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents . - testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval : it would be nice to have some resource sharing here since annotating these , and coming up with a good query set are difficult participation : two types of participation are expected . those interested in making a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , and references . those interested in participating , but not presenting papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 words . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be used to select panelists . both types of submissions are due on friday , june 5th . decisions will be made no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers are due on july 24th . working notes will be made available to all participants at the workshop . all the submissions should be sent to : prof . rohini k . srihari , cedar / suny at buffalo ub commons 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chairs ( also program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny at buffalo ( rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfei @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussetts ( manmatha @ cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university of massachussetts ( ravela @ cs . umass . edu ) program committee members : shih - fu chang ( columbia u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desai narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper or statement of interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 19th , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further questions may be directed to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html or the sigir conference main web page at http : / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 /

referencing example numbers in wp,"since the question has been raised about how to reference example numbers in wordperfect for dos , here 's my two-cents ' worth about wp5 . 1 and wp6 for dos . in 5 . 1 , although one could use paragraph numbers , as was suggested , this precludes using them to number sections of a paper . a better approach is to use the numbering facilities for "" graphics boxes . "" like paragraph numbers , graphics boxes can be referenced by the cross-reference feature in wp . what you have to do is set equation box options so that the caption is to the left of the box ( the default is to the right ) . for phonological rules , which can be nicely formatted using the equation editor , you then create an equation box with a caption consisting of "" ( [ box number ] ) "" and go into the equation editor to write the rule . for sample sentences , etc . , the box itself is empty , but with a caption as before , and set to allow text to overlap it . you can then exit the create graphics box screen and proceed to type the examples . the numbers automatically update as new boxes are added . cross - referencing is done by assigning name to any example you want to reference ( as a cross-reference target ) and then putting in a cross-reference reference code with the target 's name . you have to generate occasionally to update the reference numbers ; they initially appear as ? . in wp6 ( which is superior for linguistics because of its support for phonetic symbols ) it 's even easier . wp6 has a counters feature ( in the character format dialog box ) . you define a counter ( i call mine example ) . whenever you want to insert an example , you type ( in the main document screen ) the open parenthesis , go into the counters dialog box , and push f8 ( or click on the increment and display button ) . this inserts two codes : one to increment the number ( this is not done automatically for user-defined counters ) and one to display it . cross - referencing is done as before . a couple of additional wp tips : - the styles feature is very useful for dealing with in-text stylesheets for journals . for any feature where journals have different styles ( scare quotes , sentence glosses and translations , in-text reference punctuation , etc . ) you assign a style . styles can be any combination of characters and codes . for each journal , you create a different style library . then , if you want to change formatting from one to another , you simply read in a different style library . - the above is too simple for bibliography style sheets , where the order of elements differs in addition to punctuation and font attribute . if you are comfortable with programming , you can write merge programs ( called primary merge files in wp5 . 1 and merge form files in wp6 ) for the different stylesheets and have a bibliography file which is formatted as a secondary merge file ( wp5 . 1 ) / merge data file ( wp6 ) , with fields for things like author 's first and last names , year , title , etc . ( include a field for type of reference ( book , article , dissertation , etc . ) since the format of the title may vary . ) this is not recommended for computerphobes , however . - lining up foreign language examples with word-for - word glosses in proportional fonts can be done using tabs , and resetting the tab stops for each example . this is easier from wp6 . 0b onwards ( if you have a mouse ) because of the ruler feature : you display the ruler and drag the tab stops , and as you drag them a dotted line extends down from the tab stop through the text so you can see exactly where you are . in previous versions , you have to go into the tab set menu and play with the tab settings by trial and error . it is even possible to put asterisks inside the space of the tab between the example number and the example . instead of tabbing , use the tab align ( wp5 . 1 ) or decimal align ( wp6 ) feature ( ctrl f6 ) . before pressing ctrl - f6 , set the "" decimal character "" to the first letter of the example ( on the other format menu in 5 . 1 and the character format menu in 6 ) . to prevent the spell-checker from stopping on words in foreign examples ( or phonetic representations , or logical formulae ) , in 5 . 1 you can use the language feature to insert a made-up language code . the spell-checker will complain that it can't find the dictionary for the language , and you tell it to ignore the language and continue checking what it can . in wp6 a block can be marked [ speller / grammatik off ] ( on the other format menu ) to prevent it from being spell - or grammar-checked . - - yehuda n . falk department of english the hebrew university of jerusalem "" live long and prosper "" - vulcan greeting

new book : atomism and binding,"atomism and binding edited by hans bennis , pierre pica and johan rooryck the state of the art in binding : everything on reference , coreference , nonreference and disjoint reference , and more on boundedness and freedom . the sixteen papers in this new volume provide a representative overview of the broad range of issues relevant to the study of binding phenomena in the generative framework . since the inception of the theoretical interest in co-referential relations in generative grammar , there has been a debate with respect to the question as to whether and how ( co ) - reference should be represented in the grammar . notions such as "" ( co ) - indexation "" , "" disjoint reference "" , "" free "" and "" bound "" play an important role in this discussion . their relevance is explicitly analyzed in many articles of this volume . the role of thematic information in binding theory constitutes another important line of inquiry elaborated on in this book . various contributors to this volume argue that thematic information largely influences binding phenomena , although the specific proposals expressing this relation differ quite substantially . another issue pursued here is related to the discussion whether binding theory is a component of sentence grammar . many papers address this issue quite explicitly and delineate the respective roles of sentence and discourse grammar in novel and intriguing ways . the volume contains the following contributions : stephen berman & arild hestvik : "" split antecedents , noncoreference and drt "" ; george aaron broadwell : "" binding theory and switch-reference "" ; hamida demirdache : "" condition c "" ; robert fiengo & robert may : "" the semantic significance of syntactic identity "" ; zygmunt frajzyngier : "" pronouns and agreement : systems interaction in the coding of reference "" ; robert freidin : "" binding theory on minimalist assumptions "" ; jeff gruber : "" a configurational approach to thematic binding "" ; james higginbotham : "" a plea for implicit anaphors "" ; hajime hoji : "" sloppy identity and principle b "" ; jan koster : "" anaphora and the uniformity of grammar "" ; howard lasnik : "" levels of representation and the elements of anaphora "" ; seth minkoff : "" on the syntax of local and logophoric control "" ; gertjan postma : "" logical entailment and the possessive nature of reflexive pronouns "" ; eric reuland & sigridur sigurjonsdottir : "" long distance ' binding ' in icelandic : syntax or discourse ?

integration and disintegration in phonological theory,"dan everett 's comment on my dissertation ( as i ' ve pointed out to him ) , and by implication on how that work fits into the work of its antecedents , is misleading . dan was for some reason alluding to the fact that in the mit version of the dissertation ( though not the one that has circulated from the iulc or published by garland , which are the ones usually cited ) i mentioned in the acknowledgements that my interest in tone started with reading will leben 's 1973 dissertation : a true fact . but the dissertation itself has a chapter , the first , entirely devoted to the proposition that this work was a continuation of a discussion that has been going on in american phonology since the 1940s ! dan , i think , sees pike as the most important theoretician to cite in that period ; in my writing , i ' ve focused more on bloch , harris , and ( in my 1980 book ) on hockett , rather than pike , but this is more a matter of style and taste than anything else . [ on the same theme , i have a paper coming out ( perhaps it has come out already ) in the journal of linguistics on the genealogical connections between prosodic ( firthian ) phonology and autosegemmental phonology . ] dan has also pointed out that some of the major contributors to phonology during this period who are still very much alive and intellectual active have felt slighted by the lack of citation of their work . as i tried to suggest in my paper on firthian phonology , this is more an indictment of normal human expectations of courtesy than it is the result of people actually forgetting about these phonologists ' good , published ideas ( there is much less of that latter sin than many people wish to believe - - a point that geoff huck and i have made in a recent paper on the relation of generative semantics to current syntactic theory ) . however - - and again from a purely human point of view - - i wonder how many people , like myself , who were publishing material on nonlinear phonology in , say , its first ten years ( 1975 to 1985 ) ever received a note from one of these contributers to the literature in the 1940s and 1950s ? speaking just for myself , i am sure i would have been galvanized to have been dropped a note by . . . any of a number of linguists ; in more recent years , i ' ve had the opportunity to discuss the history of the field , in writing and in person , with a number of these linguists . but i would have been absolutely delighted to have received such a comment , a bit of mild reproof perhaps from an established contributor ( who , now , i can perceive as feeling left out ) . i never did . anyone else ? john goldsmith

computationally - intensive methods in quantitative linguistics,"second workshop in computationally-intensive methods in quantitative linguistics department of statistics university of glasgow , uk 7 - 9 september 1998 announcement and call for registration in recent years techniques from disciplines such as computer science , articficial intelligence and statistics have found their way into the pages of journals such as the journal of quantitative linguistics , literary and linguistic computing and computers and the humanities . while this influx may bring more advanced methods of analysis to the fields of quantitative linguistics , stylometry and stylistics , the demands upon researchers to understand and use these new techniques are great . familiarity with the appropriate software and the ear of a sympathetic expert are pre-requisites without which the technique may seem out of reach to the average researcher . the humanities advanced technology and information institute and the department of statistics of the university of glasgow are hence supporting this practical workshop in computationally - intensive methods in quantitative linguistics . the workshop is designed to introduce the participants to four such techniques in a practical environment . each half-day session will be divided into an introductory session in a lecture theatre and a longer period spent working with software and practical examples . all of the speakers have published papers using the analyses they will present and their aim in this workshop is to enable the participants to return to their home institutions able to carry out these techniques in the course of their own research . the sessions and speakers are as follows : harald baayen ; max planck institute for psycholinguistics , nijmegen , the netherlands . large number of rare event models walter daelemans ; university of tilburg , the netherlands . linguistics as data mining : using machine learning techniques to discover linguistic generalizations michael oakes ; university of lancaster , unted kingdom . multivariate statistics in corpus linguistics fiona tweedie ; university of glasgow , united kingdom . time series models in linguistics the workshop will be held in the mathematics building of the university of glasgow , commencing on monday 7 september at 1pm . the four workshop sessions will take place on monday afternoon , tuesday 8 september and the morning of wednesday 9 september . there will also be a half day tour on the wednesday afternoon and a reception in the hunterian art gallery on monday evening . accommodation has been arranged in university accommodation with some en suite facilities . the reception , tea and coffee , lunches on 8 and 9 september and evening meals on 7 and 8 september are included in the registration fee . the registration fee , until 15 july , is gbp150 . 00 and gbp100 . 00 for students . participants who are also attending the digital resources in the humanities conference , 9-12 september are eligible for a discount in the registration fees . for more information about the workshop and to register , please consult the web site at http : / / www . stats . gla . ac . uk / ~ cimql or send email to the conference organisers at cimql @ stats . gla . ac . uk . please note that the organisers will be attending the allc / ach conference in debrecen from 2-11 july , so responses during this time may be sparse .

summary : negated questions and exclamations,"about two weeks ago , i posted a query on two subjects : i was looking for languages ( 1 ) which can or , on the contrary , cannot use negated interrogatives like "" look , over there - is n't that john ? "" in order to express a positive expectation , and ( 2 ) which have negated wh-exclamations like german : "" was du nicht alles weisst ! "" ( lit . : ' what you do n't know all ! ' ) or serbocroatian "" sta nije sve doziveo ! "" ( lit . : ' what he did n't all live through ! ' ) , that refer to the positive , not the negative fact . first of all , i wish to thank the following colleagues for their contributions : suzanne albrecht ( sanabria @ zedat . fu-berlin . de ) gisle andersen ( henga @ alf . uib . no ) birgitta englund dimitrova ( birgitta . englund @ tolk . su . se ) frederik fouvry ( fouvry @ llsun4 . essex . ac . uk ) keith goeringer ( keg @ violet . berkeley . edu ) michael israel ( israel @ ling . ucsd . edu ) dalina kallulli ( dalina . kallulli @ avh . unit . no ) jussi karlgren ( jussi @ sics . se ) e . h . klein - v . d . laaken ( klein @ let . rug . nl ) james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) randy lapolla ( hslapolla @ ccvax . sinica . edu . tw ) pierre larrivee ( aaa552 @ agora . ulaval . ca ) bert peeters ( bert . peeters @ modlang . utas . edu . au ) francisco raga ( raga @ vents . uji . es ) alexandr rosen ( alexandr . rosen @ ff . cuni . cz ) cristina sanz ( sanzc @ gusun . acc . georgetown . edu ) karen stanley ( karen _ stanley @ cpcc . cc . nc . us ) jan vorster ( vorsterj @ mtb . und . ac . za ) ton van der wouden ( vdwouden @ let . rug . nl ) deborah yeager ( kyeager @ prism . nmt . edu ) ning zhang ( zning @ epas . utoronto . ca ) the languages i received information about were : afrikaans , albanian , catalan , chinese , czech , english , dutch , norwegean , spanish , swedish , yucatec maya . no additional languages have been named where the use of negated questions like "" look , over there - is n't that john ? "" was not possible ; so apache and navajo are still the only examples i have found so far . . as to the negated wh-exclamations , what is most interesting is that they do exist in languages where the native speakers i had asked so far had been convinced that they do not . examples for this are english and spanish , cf . : what i did n't do to get that report finished on time ! ( karen stanley ) cuanto no tendre que sufrir hasta conseguirlo ! ( cristina sanz ) this type of construction can obviously be found in much more languages than i had assumed . in some of them , it seems to be old fashened and not very wide spread , but it still exists as such . ( if anybody now comes to think of one more language that allows that type of utterance - i am still collecting , and i ' m grateful for any help i can get ! ) as to the question of why and how these negated questions and wh-exclamations work : i am dealing with it in paper of mine ( to be published ) , and i ' ll be glad to mail it to anybody who is interested , but i ' m afraid it 's in german . thanks once again to all who helped , and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions . elke hentschel

re : 5 . 1404 comparative method in linguistics,"karl teeter is mistaken , i think , when he says that you cannot classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences in the lexical items , when he says that you would treat english and french as related ( via the norman borrowings ) if you did this , when he says that the idea of using this method is "" novel "" , when he says that you can only classify lamnguages as related if you have written a comparative grammar , etc . ( a ) for many language families , there is no other basis for classification available , because they lack the kind of morphological complexity so beloved of indo - europeanists , algonkianists , and those other - ists who happen to enjoy its blessings in "" their "" languages , ( b ) the danger of confusing borrowings for cognates is always real , but it is easy to see that the lexical connaections of english with french are more transparent phonologically and less central semantically than those with dutch , hence more recent , hence borrowings . ( c ) there is nothing novel in what i am saying , since it is the method which , for example , edward sapir used to establish that the uto - aztecan languages are really a family ( rather than three families ) . ( d ) you cannot possibly realistically expect normal people to spend time writing comparative grammars of languages which have not previously been shown to be related . so classification must come first ! on the other hand , it is perfectly easy to write a "" crazy "" comparative grammar for any random group of languages , e . g . , french and english . the last is perhaps the most important point : reconstruction of morphological systems can be done well or badly , so can comparison of lexical items . both can yield correct results ; both can also produce garbage . p . s . i say ' lexical items ' deliberately , because there seem to be language families where there is no morphology at all to compare . in most cases , howveer , there are some bound morphemes , and one compares those as well ( as did sapir in the case of uto - aztecan ) . but this is a far cry from reconstructing the kind of intricate morphological patterns found in the older indo - european languages , for example , but absent from many other language families .

the informational complexity of learning,"kluwer academic publishers is proud to announce the publication of : the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar by partha niyogi massachusetts institute of technology among other topics , the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar brings together two important but very different learning problems within the same analytical framework . the first concerns the problem of learning functional mappings using neural networks , followed by learning natural language grammars in the principles and parameters tradition of chomsky . these two learning problems are seemingly very different . neural networks are real-valued , infinite-dimensional , continuous mappings . on the other hand , grammars are boolean-valued , finite-dimensional , discrete ( symbolic ) mappings . the book 's objective is to bridge this gap . it uses the formal techniques developed in statistical learning theory and theoretical computer science over the last decade to analyze both kinds of learning problems . specific results include model selection in neural networks , active learning , language learning and evolutionary models of language change . the informational complexity of learning : perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar is a very interdisciplinary work . all individuals interested in the interaction of computer science and cognitive science should enjoy the book . researchers in artificial intelligence , neural networks , linguistics , theoretical computer science , and statistics will find it particularly relevant . contents foreword . preface . 1 . introduction . 2 . generalization error for neural nets . 3 . active learning . 4 . language learning . 5 . language change . 6 . conclusions . 1998 248 pp . isbn 0-7923 - 8081 - 9 $ 98 . 00 for more information about this publication , please visit our on - line catalogue at : http : / / www . wkap . nl or you may order directly from : kluwer academic publishers 101 philip drive norwell , ma . 02061 phone : 781-871 - 6600 , fax : ( 781 ) 871-6528 , e - mail : kluwer @ wkap . com kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 322 3300 ah dordrecht , the netherlands phone 31 78 639 2392 , fax : 31 78 6546474 , e - mail : services @ wkap . nl

profit on technology !,"( pardon this intrusion , you were mentioned as someone who would have an interest in technology ) we are in the beginning of an exciting , "" trillion dollar emerging market "" in technology . in the next 3 minutes below , i will show you how to capitalize on this extraordinary trend ! here 's the trillion dollar trend in american business that i ' m speaking of ! you may have noticed over the past few months the incredible number of billion dollar mergers in us business . huge mergers like worldcom and mci , travelers and citicorp - the list is endless but they one common thread - services , services , services ! ! services like : travel services , banking services , telephony services , entertainment services and utility services . all of these services that you , i and everyone we know use , are being combined into one , trillion dollar market of "" bundled services "" . services have been the fastest growing segment of the us economy for a number of years but this "" bundled services "" market is new . these are services that everyone uses - everyday , offered from one , simple source ! why are "" bundled services "" such a big deal ? let 's add it up : banking services = hundreds of billions travel services = hundred of billions telephony services = $ 200 billion in us , $ 1 trillion worldwide ( internet access , paging , cellular , long distance , local dial , cable tv , digital satellite , voice mail , virtual office , web tv ) utilities ( being deregulated now ) : electricity = $ 250 billion , gas = $ 70 bill . internet commerce = $ 8 billion ( projected to reach $ 350 billion in 5 years ) in short , "" bundled services "" are every conceivable service that you , i and everyone we know uses . a war is waging for these huge markets with the largest service companies in the world , and millions will be made from those entrepreneurs who position themselves in front of this trend . these service / technology companies are buying companies left and right so they can offer more services . these companies are fighting tooth and nail because they know something most of us do n't know . as a gte study reveals , when a customer enrolls on a single service they will stay on that service for an average of 2 years , with two services the average moves to 4 years . when a customer enrolls on 3 services , they will stay with that provider for an incredible average of 20 years ! imagine the cash flow on just one customer using 3 - 6-10 - 20 services , for 20 years . what would that cash flow be worth ? a whole bunch , and that 's why the race is on . the first company to get customers on 3 or more services - wins ! that 's why these service companies are spending billions in advertising to attract customers . but . . . these huge , traditional service companies have a serious problem . they can not get directly in front these customers . even if they could send someone directly over , would they find them at home ? if they were at home , would they let them in their house ? people decide on which service companies they wish to use , based on recommendations from people they know ! here 's my point : who better to make recommendations for services than from the people you know ! we do this unconsciously everyday anyway - now you can get paid for it ! we simply , and very passively , offer people we know , a "" free package of services "" designed to save them money and make their life simpler . the more they use the more they save ! this package will make their life easier with single billing for all the services they use . we can save them money by leveraging our parent companies $ 1 . 6 billion dollar buying power to offer the most competitive prices available anywhere for this package ! it gets even better ! we are not talking about no-name companies with questionable service . we are talking about the biggest service and technology companies in the world ! companies that are already a household name . these companies realize that "" word of mouth "" is the best way to get in front of customers . your associates & friends win , and you win ! they handle all the service / customer support - we just make the recommendation ( this could be as simple as passing out a brochure ) . services can create a true residual income ( no inventories here ! ) . what could an extra $ 10 - $ 50 , 000 a year do for your family - for the next 20 years ? with a more concentrated effort , the potential is "" income replacement "" and beyond . in addition to the monthly residual income you will earn on these services , you may also earn over rides on other re-marketers . the system of delivering services in the next evolutionary step in networking - we call it "" internetworking "" . the reason we call it "" internetworking "" is that everything can be accomplished via the internet . given the trillion dollar size of this untapped market , our financial backing and billion dollar partners , we project that we will be a billion dollar company and household name in 3 years . you are learning about us in the first 30 days ! timing is everything . imagine if you talked with an associate who has numerous property management contacts . let 's say this contact of yours knew several property managers who own thousands of rental units . the property management company could offer these services to thousands of tenants . the property management company earns a fortune , your associate earns a fortune and you earn a fortune . this is leveraged income ! there are hundreds of ways to market this because everyone uses these services . as a matter of fact , who do you know that would not be interested in saving money on their service bills , with the same top grade service companies and have the convenience of a single bill ? in summary , bundled services are a trillion dollar untapped market , ripe for entrepreneurs with vision . customers get the same quality service from the largest providers but now through one source ! because of our buying power and the fact you afford to give bigger discounts when customers are using more services ( bundled ) , it 's a win / win situation , and represents one of the largest business trends of this century . . . food for thought . . . social psychologists tell us that each person runs into at least two opportunities that could in fact , reshape their lives . the question here is this , is this your first opportunity or your last ? an interesting question . with a simple investigation , you will determine this opportunity and company , is for real . if you ' re too busy , that 's exactly why you need to do this . in three years or less , you can create the lifestyle you wish , with the effort of course . get the facts and make an informed decision . please visit our site now : http : / / www . vwcs . com / pauld thank you for your attention , the wave 4 group ps : this is a one time mailing

"re : 3 . 421 linguists , human subjects","i had the same reaction as martin volk to michael kac 's idea that linguists become linguists because they ' re superior language learners . my gut reaction was that it must be wrong , that we become linguists because we have a hard time learning language , that effortless polyglots pay no conscious attention at all to grammar or any other systems of rules . i was about to offer myself as an example when i realized that i _ am _ a pretty good language learner , but i ' ve always found the process frustrating . i hated learning languages because it seemed so dreary and inefficient until i discovered some shortcuts , namely syntax , phonology , morphology , etc . if my case is at all generalizable , then ( happily ) messrs volk and kac are both right - - we become linguists because we have some skill at language learning , but we are also the rational sort that thinks there must be a better , more efficient way to go about it ( and therefore perceive ourselves as having "" trouble "" with it ) . am i weird , or did it happen this way for other people ? let 's hear more . mark hansell asian lang . & lit . carleton college northfield , mn usa

judicial judgments - child support - investigator - ( 11116 ),"thank you for your interest in our training course ! ! success courses offers an extensive audio training course in "" how to collect judicial judgments "" . if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a judicial judgment is and why processing judicial judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a judicial judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : "" its now up to you to collect on the judgment "" . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . "" in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . "" the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected judicial judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 4 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing judicial judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of judicial judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today success courses and our associates have over 632 million dollars in judicial judgments that we are currently processing . of this 632 million , 36 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid judicial judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non-confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor does n't know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful judicial processing are as follows : = b7 mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with judicial judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) = b7 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you do n't call them unless you want to . = b7 you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . = b7 you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . = b7 once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) = b7 when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . = b7 once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote 's from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future . there 's no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on . after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now .

translation,"translation into the second language stuart campbell paper 0 582 30188 2 224 pages 1998 applied linguistics and language study series longman the dynamics of immigration , international commerce and the postcolonial world make it inevitable that much translation is done into a second language , despite the prevailing wisdom that translators should only work into their mother tongue . this book is the first study to explore the phenomenon of translation into a second language in a way that will interest applied linguists , translators and translation teachers , and esol teachers working with advanced level students . rather than seeing translation into a second language as deficient output , this study adopts an interlanguage framework to consider l2 translation as the product of developing competence ; learning to translate is seen as a special variety of second language acquisition . through carefully worked case studies , separate components of translation competence are identified , among them the ability to create stylistically authentic texts in english , the ability to monitor and edit output , and the psychological attitudes that the translator brings to the task . while the case studies mainly deal with arabic speakers undergoing translator training in australia , the conclusions will have implications for translation into a second language , especially english , around the world . ' translation into the second language ' is firmly grounded in empirical research , and in this regard it serves as a stimulus and a methodological guide for further research . it will be a valuable addition for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of applied linguistics , translation theory , bilingualism and second language acquisition as well as those involved in teaching or practising translation at a professional level . stuart campbell associate professor in language studies , and director of the language acquisition research centre at the university of western sydney macarthur . further information on the books published in this series , and the table of contents for this title can be viewed at the longman linguistics on-line catalogue at : http : / / www . awl-he . com / linguistics for a complete listing of our world-wide offices , please click below : http : / / www . awl-he . com / offices available for review

typological classification,"a few remarks on fritz newmeyer 's posting on classification in language typology : of course it is not always easy to decide to which type a given language should be assigned , since there may be conflicting criteria . but some people seem to think that this is somehow a deep problem with language typology . in reality , there is no deep problem here at all , so the typological literature is quite right in not dwelling on such trivial methodological points too much , concentrating on substantive and theoretical issues instead . true , the methodology of language typology is somewhat different from the methodology used in single-language studies that most linguists engange in . when searching for significant correlations between features / parameters in the world 's language , one has to classify languages , and the more languages one looks at , the less energy one can spend on resolving each individual case . clearly , the speacialist will sometimes disagree with the way her or his language was assigned , but then most of them time not all specialists agree on the right classification themselves . when the criteria are in conflict , it may sometimes be necessary to give more weight to some than to others in a somewhat arbitrary way - - but this is simply one reflection of the necessary idealization that accompanies any serious scientific endeavor . it 's as simple as that : the more one studies linguistic phenomena in breadth , the more one loses in depth . but vice versa , linguists that study only one or a few languages are working on an extremely narrow basis and lose in breadth what they gain in depth . ideally , typological research should be conducted by teams of linguists , much in the same way as research in big science is organized . with more resources that are combined , one could study linguistic phenomena in considerable breadth and depth simultaneously . an attempt to follow this strategy has been made in the european science programme in language typology , which has been running in europe for the past five years ( wait for 10 volumes on the typology of european languages , to appear with mouton de gruyter in a year 's time ) . this was only a very modest , seriously underfunded attempt , but until we attract really big research money or manage to agree on more things , we have to be happy that we have colleagues like johanna nichols who are willing to make enormous efforts to get a view of linguistic phenomena on a global scale . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )

"re : 8 . 764 , disc : noam chomsky : a life of dissent","i read robert f . barsky 's reply to postal 's and pullum 's comments about feargul murphy 's review of his ( barsky 's ) book and found it odd , to say the least . about three quarters of barsky 's reply do ( does ? ) not deal with the postal - pullum comments about murphy 's review for the linguist but with a review by pullum for ' nature ' of barsky 's book . i can understand that barsky feels the need to defend himself against pullum ( who would n't ) , but most of what he says is simply irrelevant to the issue at hand . postal & pullum wrote a reply to murphy , not to barsky . but even granting that this was a welcome opportunity for barsky to reply to pullum 's ' nature ' review , i see no justification for the fact that this reply deals almost exclusively with chomsky 's non-linguistic activities , which were not at issue in p&p 's reply to murphy . p&p are concerned with what they take to be inaccuracies being spread by murphy ( and barsky ) about one specific issue : the politics of the mit linguistics department at a certain point in history . p&p mention chomsky 's non-academic political activities only very briefly , and only insofar as they are relevant to chomsky the linguist : they concern murphy 's strangely irrelevant remark that "" chomsky was at this time simply very busy with other issues like the vietnam war "" .

"reduplication in child language acquisition and foreigner talk , etc .","in conducting a study of derivational morphology in creole languages , i have been investigating the origins of reduplication in the same . specifically , i am trying to determine whether it is best to explain the form and / or meaning of reduplicated structures in creoles in terms of the influence of substrate languages or in terms of the effect of language universals , or both . it has been suggested that data from child language acquisition studies may shed light on the question . also , data regarding "" baby talk "" and "" foreigner talk "" ( i . e talk by adults to children and non-native speakers , respectively ) may help in determining the extent to which reduplication in creoles should be explained in terms of language universals . additionally , the patterns of use of reduplication by adult second language learners in theirnon-native language ( s ) may also prove useful . thus , i would greatly appreciate any information you can give me ( by way of data , descriptions , references , etc . ) regarding the following questions : 1 . is reduplication a universal feature of children 's speech , baby talk , or foreigner talk cross-linguistically ? any examples ? 2 . where reduplication is indeed a feature of the above-mentioned speech varieties , what semantics are associated with the reduplicated forms ? specifically , is reduplication used as a category-changing operation , or is it used only in a modificatory way ( e . g . diminutivization , augmentation , etc . ) with no category change effected on the words to which it applies ? 3 . where reduplication is a feature of the above-mentioned speech varieties , what phonological form does it take ? i . e is total reduplication the rule ( e . g . "" the tiny tiny mouse ' ) ? or is total reduplication with modification ( e . g . "" teeny-weeny "" ) what we find ? or do we find partial reduplication of one kind or another , in which only syllables or parts of syllables are reduplicated ? andy saperstein adsap @ ling . ohio-state . edu ohio state university

sum : word processors for linguists,"summary of question about numbered examples , etc . in word 2 for windows first of all i want to thank all those who showed me how to number examples in word and gave me other advice . secondly , i want to apologize for not mentioning that i was referring to windows programs , and not mac programs . most people who wrote figured that one out , probably from the version numbers . in what follows , my comments are in square brackets . this was the original question : > i am thinking of moving ( "" migrating "" ? ) from wordperfect 6 to ms word > 6 , which came bundled with my new computer , and would like to know if people > with similar experiences have anything of interest to say about such a move , > such as for example any good references to look into ( that are not too basic ; > the software did n't come with a reference manual , just the online manual ) . > > two specific questions : > > 1 ) numbered examples : wp can set up counters , which is how i dealt with > numbered examples . word does n't seem to have a similar > capability ? could that be possible ? how do people deal with automatic > numbering of examples in word ( as well as cross-references to examples ) ? > > 2 ) file manager : this is something where wp is better than word by a long > shot , but i understand there are add-ons for word out there . has anybody > heard of this ? > > 3 ) search software : while i ' m at it , i just got a message about a software > utility called powersearch , by commtech , which has powerful search mechanisms > and works in word or wordperfect ( there are two versions ) . has anyone had > any experience with this ? ( it is obtainable with ftp ) . windows vs . mac [ there are more than twice as much pcs out there than mac 's , but perhaps among linguists the percentages are more even . i ' m not ready to change though . i am quite happy with pcs thank you very much . ] you do n't say whether you ' re a mac or pc person , but the reviews of word 6 for mac were uniformly enormously negative : they actually ported woindows onto the mac ! since we mac users continually have to escape the really lousy windows imitations of things the mac does gracefully , we can't imaging why they did that ! the macuser review recommended nisuswritier as the word processor of choice now ( and if you are evern going to use alien scripts , there 's no substitute ) ; but you shluld also look at framemaker ( abvailable for lots of platforms , ioncluding windows ) ; it can number an idefinitely large number of different series , cross-refer between chapters that are separate files , etc . it only is n't woldscript - sensitive . ( version 4 . 0 . 4 was sort of , but was buggy , and in the just-released version 5 , they abancdoned it . ) wordperfect vs . word [ the advantage of wp for linguists is definitely the special characters it supports , though the special fonts that come with wp ( which are true type ) will work , i believe , with word , so word users can get a hold of these true type fonts from their wp user friends . ] i am in a similar situation : my new office computer came with microsoft office , which includes word . i toyed with the idea of switching from word perfect , but after a minimal amount of tinkering with word , i have about abandoned the idea . the main reason , for me , is that word perfect comes with a fairly extensive set of special characters , which i use a lot . they include several foreign alphabets , most of the ipa alphabet , characters for logical notation , and so forth . word , as far as i can tell , comes with hardly any of these . so i have about decided to erase office from my hard drive and install what i really use . numbered examples [ word can indeed number examples or anything at all . the terminology is a bit different though , which is why i was confused . in wp you set up counters , but in word you set up sequences . ] [ several people told me that they had gotten this to work , though they did n't all know how they did it . however , after they pointed me in the right direction , i was able to figure it out . ] you set up a counter by using the seq field ( look in your manual under fields ) . fields are somewhat like codes in wordperfect , they have links to things like counters ( chapter number , section , number ) or dates , file names , etc . one of the fields is seq . ( a ) chose : insert / field , click seq , which will give you a seq in the bottom window ; add "" ex / n "" to the right of the seq code in lower window , press return ( the ex is the name or identifier for the counter , the / n is to increase the number by 1 ) . the first time you do this a 1 will show up , the second a 2 , etc . ( you can set up more than one such counter / sequence by giving each sequence a diferent name an identifier ) ( there are many predefined sequences , e . g . { seq chapter } refers to chapter numbers . ) ( b ) you can create a macro , which then you can assign to a button or a key combination , which does : 1 ) choose a paragraph type you ' ve created which has the right margins , font size , etc . for your example paragraph ; and 2 ) right tab , ( , the stuff in ( a ) above , ) , left tab . ( c ) cross - referencing examples : very easy . first you have to create a bookmark for an example you want to cross-reference : a ) highlight the number created in ( a ) above ( along with the parentheses ) . b ) choose edit / bookmark , give the bookmark a name ( 40 characters ) , e . g . donkey _ sentence c ) when you want to refer to it , you type , e . g . , "" as we saw in example "" ; then you click insert / cross - reference , click bookmark , click the name of the bookmark , click insert . of course , many of these operations can be simplified with macros . there are many possibilities that i have n't mentioned . for instance , if you want to number the examples in ch . 3 in the format ( 3 . 1 ) , all you have to is before you insert the field for seq , you insert the field for the chapter . ] help on numbering in word 2 came from : numbering examples in dos : you are right , the automatic numbering of examples in word ( . 4 , . 5 & . 6 ) is inexistant which is a problem for linguists since we deal with a lot of examples in our text . if this can be of any interst for you i have found an excellent programm which allows me to do automatic numbering of examples as well as cross-references to examples in the text . the name of the program is renumber 1 . 2 and you can get it by writing to : jonathan mead ; 356 no . spaulding ave . ; los angele , ca ; usa 90036 or by e-mailing jonathan at : izzyt09 @ uclamvs i have been told that the fees for this programm are $ 15 . for student and $ 20 . for non student . [ i have used renumber in the past , and it works well . it is not as convenient as the features in word and wordperfect though . ] powerful searches if you are a mac user and are looking for super-sophisticated searching , try nisus which uses grep conventions and is the best going that i know of . regarding your 's earch ' question , there is a * lot * of stuff available out there , depending on the scope of your intended use . . . . if you ' re just going for personal use on 1 pc , you may want to look at eclipse find , not free , but only $ 99 , last time i looked . ( just my $ 0 . 02 ) . [ powersearch seems to be pretty nice . i downloaded it from simtel ( ftp oak . oakland . edu , cd simtel / win3 / winword ( or cd simtel / win3 / wpwin ) , and get the compressed binary file powersch . zip ( or searchwp . zip ) . unfortunatel this version has the powerful features locked , and to unlock them you have to send in $ 50 , which i have not done . the search possibilities seem pretty impressive . trees huge advantage if you would make use of it is that you can easily draw trees , using the integral drawing program ( from what people say , it sounds better than arboreal ) . i keep a little file of tree-parts . reference books [ i should say that the microsoft office professional cd-rom which came wih my computer does have all the manuals in it . af first , i was n't too excited about these electronic books , but now that i ' ve gotten used to the idea , it 's not so bad . ] books : i have borland 's running word 6 . it is fairly adequate . but it does not explain about styles and templates sufficiently , to my mind ( admittedly somewhat addled ) and it does not have enough information about long documents ( master documents ) . the index is useless , until you already know what you want to find out . the help system is extensive , though again it is sometimes hard to know what to ask it . depending on your learning style , you may be quite handicapped without a real manual , but happily there are commercial versions available at most bookstores "" prima visual learning guide for word 6 . 0 "" ( prima publishing , po box 1260bk rocklin , ca 95677 ) is an example . on the other hand , it is good to get used to the on-line help , because it 's always there . file managers what do you want to do ? delete files ? view files ? create directories ? windows file manager , while not the best option , offers much of this function , just a mouse click away . also , try word 's find file command ( under the file menu ) i was real happy when i figured out how to do this one : i knew you could look at a file in wp without opening it , but i was not sure how to do this in word : here 's how : from the file menu , choose find file . select the file whose contents you want to view . if you do n't see the file you are looking for , search for it : click on the search button , choose the drive and directory ( s ) you want to look in , make a wildcard filename ( like * . rev ) choose include subdirectories ( if you want to check your whole drive , etc ) , click on ok , and look at the list of files found . to preview the file , select preview in the view box ( still in the find file dialog box . then just click on the filename you want to look at , and you will see the first page on the screen . you can scroll through it to browse , you can delete , copy , open etc . by choosing the commands button . - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - jon aske home address : bates college 12 bardwell st . lewiston , maine 04240 , usa lewiston , maine 04240-6336 e-mail : jaske @ abacus . bates . edu - phone / fax : ( 207 ) 786-0589 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -

sum : ' this ' and ' that ',"dear colleagues : last week i sent a query to this list asking you about the fomral opposition between ' this ' and ' that ' in the demonstratives ( june 4 , 6 . 772 , qs : ' this ' , . . . ) . i have received 26 responses by now , and so think it necessary to compile a quick summary today as i will be away from tokyo for more than two weeks starting tomorrow . the original text of my query was as follows : some present-day ' european ' languages have only one set of simple demonstratives and the opposition of ( this ) vs . < that > is expressed by the help of ( here ) and < there > : french ceci ' this ' ce livre-ci ' this book ' cela ' that ' ce livre-l ` a ' that book ' swedish det ha "" r ' this ' den ha "" r bilen ' this car ' det da "" r ' that ' den da "" r bilen ' that car ' estonian see siin ' this ' see maja siin ' this house ' see seal ' that ' see maja seal ' that house ' my sweidish - german dictionary ( stora tyska ordboken ) gives ( der hier ) and ( der da ) as colloquial ( familia "" r , umgangssprachlich ) german forms which conrrespond to ( den ha "" r ) and < den da "" r > , respectively . how common is a demonstrative system like this ? incidentally , japanese has a rather sophisticated three-way distinction here : kono hon ' this book ( you see here ) ' sono hon ' that book ( you see there ) , the book ( under discussion ) ' ano hon ' that book ( you see over there ) ' so i ' m afraid i will have to convince my students that the japanese are extravagant even in the way of using demonstratives . though the last paragraph was intended as an allusion to the way japanese tourists spend money overseas , quite a few people , both japanese and non - japanese , took it seriously and tried to convince me that the japanese language ( sic ! ) was by no means "" extravagant "" because it was not alone in having a three-way distinction in the demonstratives . some even drew my attention to the existence of a language with a five-way distinction . i thank them for the examples of various demonstrative systems they sent me , but this is not the point i wanted to discuss . perhaps i should have stated explicitly that i was interested in the morphology of demonstrative pronouns / adjectives . it is very important that french , for instance , has one basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective , i . e . ( ce ) , on the morph-lexical level , and that the speaker of french may optionally add an element meaning either ( here ) or < there > in order to make finer distinctions ( ce livre-ci , cette table-l ' a ) . in japanese , however , there 's no single basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective like ( ce ) in french : the speaker of japanese must always choose one from the set of three lexically distinct demonstrative forms . this is a big difference , and puzzels many of my students in my estonian syntax class . here are the responses which i think have direct relevance to my interest : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i imagine that your posting was a bit abbreviated , so did not mention the swedish demonstratives denna / detta / dessa and den / det / de , which in any case are grammatically correct but not usual in conversational speech ( "" den tiden , "" "" det aaret , "" "" de fraagorna "" ) . one would expect danish and norwegian to be similar in this regard to swedish , but unfortunately i have little information to contribute . while danish does has both den / det / de and so on plus the option of adding "" der "" ( "" tag den bog , "" "" naer saa du de mennesker ? "" ; "" hvad er det der ? "" , "" jeg tager dem ( der ) "" ) , i ' m not certain whether usage is quite the same , that is , whether the "" den der "" forms predominate as they do in swedish . [ . . . ] certain dialects of american english do use "" this here "" and "" that there , "" as attested by the way schoolteachers warn their students not to use those expressions . they ' re nonstandard and are regarded as uneducated usages , though i suspect that they actually come from older dialects of british descent in which they were acceptable . - - brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) - - the use of compund demonstratives is indeed common in my own mother tongue , norwegian , and i believe in all ' scandinavian ' languages , ie norwegian , danish and swedish . i feel that it is a feature of colloquial speech , and i would be surprised to find it in ( formal ) writing . in fast speech the distinction between the two demonstratives tends to be lost , at least in my own dialect ( bergen , western norway ) : den her bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( this car ) den der bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( that car ) moreover , norwegian ( and , i believe , swedish + danish ) has the distinctions : den bilen vs denne bilen ( that car vs this car ; masc . ) det huset vs dette huset ( that house vs this house ; neu . ) which seem to correspond closely to this / that in english , and are perfectly acceptable in written and spoken norwegian . - - gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) - - as a native speaker , i would not really use ( der hier ) even colloquial , ( der da ) is possible , an would more likely contrast with < der dort > , which implies that ( der da ) goes along with < this > and not with < that > ! but in general : it is always a problem for native speakers of german to acquire the this / that distinction , as we do not draw the same boundaries . maybe , a more formal ( in terms of the register ) would be : ( dieses ) ( this ) and < jenes > ( that ) - - this it at least what i use in translations ( and also what my german / english dictionary advises me to do - but never trust a dictionary ) . actually , we do not use ( jenes ) very much , it goes along with very formal speech and maybe even old - fashioned . - - gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) - - english colloquially , esp . black eng . vernacular , uses ' this here ' and ' that there . ' ' this book here ' vs .

6 . 136 language and species,"just a brief remark a propos of bemji wald 's comment on chomsky 's comment on whether apes can be shown to command ' reflexivization ' ; in particular the question of whether recognizing your image in a mirror as 's elf ' would be a sign of that ability . if it 's of interest , cats have a very peculiar relationship with mirrors . in my experience , most cats do not recognize images in mirrors , or tv , etc . as three-dimensional at all , and simply disregard them . but there are smart cats who do recogtnize their own images as cats in mirrors : but almost invariably as ' non-self ' . the typical reaction of a cat seeing itself in a mirror , if it 's a ' recognizer ' , is to bristle and hiss and go into defense-mode , or sometimes attack-mode . this of course raises what i like to call the dr doolittle problem : since we can't talk to animals we have to anthropomorphise and try to guess by analogy what they might be doing , but have no sense of what it feels like to be doing whatever . but in any case reflexivity is a bad example , because in general most animals do not have , in nature , any opportunity to see themselves ; animals that do confront mirror - like objects a lot ( say surface predators that hunt under water like herons , some cats , raccoons ) probably must deliberately as it were disregard the image they see , because they have to concentrate on refraction and what 's below the surface . roger lass department of linguistics university of cape town

"" on this same note , stavros macrakis states : "" if the provenance [ of the e - text ] is not clear , i do n't know why you 'd want to cite the thing in the first place ! if i give you a half-dozen xerox copies without the necessary bibliographic information , you would be wise not to rely on them too much ! "" and finally an important note on etiquette from evelyn todd : "" if you wish to cite an item that you received via [ . . . e-mail lists ] , please consider if the posting was public or private and contact its author for permission to cite . postings can be considered as published material , but it is always wise to check with the author before assuming that widespread dissemination was intended .

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / www . interwise . cc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully processed immediately * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

1999 genetic and evolutionary computation,"invitation to become a member of the program committee for the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco-99 ) http : / / www-illigal . ge . uiuc . edu / gecco / greetings : the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco ) would like to invite recent authors of papers related to genetic and evolutionary computation ( gec ) to become members of the program committee of the gecco conference to be held on july 13-17 , 1999 in orlando , florida . as you may know , the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco ) will be a combined meeting of the eighth international conference on genetic algorithms ( icga ) and the fourth annual genetic programming conference ( gp ) in cooperation with the american association for artificial intelligence ( aaai ) , parallel problem solving from nature ( ppsn ) steering committee , the international conference on evolvable systems ( ices ) steering committee , and other organizations and conferences to be announced . gecco will be held in lieu of icga-99 and gp-99 , and as such , it combines the oldest continuously running gec conference , and the two largest gec conferences . we believe that the gecco conference in 1999 will be a unique opportunity to bring together an exceptionally large number of people from all facets of genetic and evolutionary computation . being on the program committee will involve reading , reviewing , and ranking about half a dozen submitted papers on genetic and evolutionary computation or related areas during the month of february 1999 . ( the paper submission deadline for gecco-99 is wednesday , january 27 , 1999 ) . the willingness of active contributors to help the conference in this way is absolutely critical to the success of gecco . in the past , some have complained that their point of view has been excluded from the review process . by agreeing to join us , active gec researchers will help make the gecco review process fair , open , and broadly participatory . as part of the charter establishing this conference , extraordinary steps have been taken to ensure that ( 1 ) review representation is exceptionally broad and ( 2 ) the traditions , norms , and standards of the different flavors of gec are respected . let us take a brief moment to explain how this will be done . first , the charter of the conference says that reviewers are automatically invited based on their recent contribution of a peer-reviewed publication : a person may be a reviewer for the conference if he or she is an author of at least one peer-reviewed paper in a journal , conference proceedings book , or collected book of papers published since january 1 , 1995 involving any aspect or combinations of aspects of [ genetic and ] evolutionary computation . thus , becoming a reviewer is even-handedly based on recency of peer-reviewed contribution . second , gecco explicitly recognizes and respects the different traditions of different sub-fields within gec and related disciplines . as such , the conference has established six different tracks each with its own chair / editor : 1 . evolution strategies / evolutionary programming ( es / ep ) . a . e . eiben , gusz @ wi . leidenuniv . nl 2 . genetic algorithms / classifier systems ( ga / cs ) . robert e . smith , rsmith @ btc . uwe . ac . uk 3 . genetic programming / evolvable hardware ( gp / eh ) . wolfgang banzhaf ( also proceedings editor - in - chief ) , banzhaf @ ls11 . informatik . uni-dortmund . de 4 . artificial life , adaptive behavior , and agents ( aaa ) . vasant honavar , honavar @ cs . iastate . edu 5 . dna and molecular computing ( dna / mc ) . max h . garzon , mgarzon @ memphis . edu 6 . real - world applications ( rwa ) . mark jakiela , mjj @ mecf . wustl . edu these separate "" demes "" will establish separate rules and standards for paper acceptance based on the practices within the sub-discipline . in this way , we hope to more closely group "" birds of a feather "" and thereby avoid the rejection of high quality papers by reviewers who are less than familiar with the standards that should apply to a particular kind of paper . with this kind of carefully constructed process , we believe that a large number of recent gec authors will choose to join the program committee . if you are willing to be a member ( reviewer ) of the program committee , please email gecco @ aaai . org ( note : please do not use a "" reply "" command to respond to this message since dave goldberg will be out of town for most of june ) and send the following information : ( 1 ) the exact way you want your name listed , ( 2 ) the institutional affiliation you want listed with your name , ( 3 ) your physical mailing address , ( 4 ) your phone number ( for courier address labels ) , ( 5 ) your preferred e-mail address , ( 6 ) which of the six committees you would like to join ( gp / eh , ga / cs , or es / ep , aaa , dna / mc , or rwa ) , and if you have a preference for one of the sub-categories within that committee ( gp and / or eh , ga and / or cs , es and / or ep , alife and / or adaptive behavior and / or agents , dna and / or mc ) .

new book : language processes,"social and cognitive approaches to interpersonal communication edited by susan r . fussell , carnegie mellon university roger j . kreuz , university of memphis historically , the social aspects of language use have been considered the domain of social psychology , while the underlying psycholinguistic mechanisms have been the purview of cognitive psychology . recently , however , it has become increasingly clear that these two dimensions are highly interrelated : cognitive mechanisms underlying speech production and comprehension interact with social psychological factors , such as beliefs about one 's interlocutors and politeness norms , and with the dynamics of the conversation itself , to produce shared meaning . this realization has led to an exciting body of research integrating the social and cognitive dimensions which has greatly increased our understanding of human language use . this volume contains a collection of papers by noted social and cognitive psychologists illustrating this theme . each chapter demonstrates how the theoretical approaches and research methods of social and cognitive psychology can be successfully interwoven to provide insight into one or more fundamental questions about the process of interpersonal communication . the topics under investigation include the nature and role of speaker intentions in the communicative process , the production and comprehension of indirect speech and figurative language , perspective-taking and conversational collaboration , and the relationships between language , cognition , culture , and social interaction . the book will be of interest to all those who study interpersonal language use : social and cognitive psychologists , theoretical and applied linguists , and communication researchers . 0-8058 - 2269 - 0 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 59 . 95 0-8058 - 2270 - 4 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 32 . 50 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com

sum : analogy to 1sg,"some time ago i posted query asking for an an example of an analogical development in the inflectional system of any language , preferably an indo - european language , whereby the 2d and 3d persons singular were remade in the image of the 1st sg . the very possibility of such a development appears to have been denied in an important article by cowgill on the reflexes of ie laryngeals in greek , and it struck me as a bizarre claim , but i could not found any ready counterexamples . i would like to thank robert hoberman , lars borin , dana paramskas , george fowler , maggie winters , and max wheeler for responding . the closest to what i am looking for was identified by wayles browne : polish present tenses of the verb ' to eat ' : jem 1sg jesz 2sg je 3sg of these , only jem is inherited . the other two forms have been remade analogically , replacing what would be expected to come out as * jesi , * jes ' c ' . however , even this example is not completely compelling since it seems that the analogy here involves this verb taking the endings typical of another conjugation rather than specifically remodeling the 2sg and 3sg on the basis of the 1sg . so , was cowgill right ? can 1sg never serve as the basis for an analogical remaking of 2sg and 3sg ? ( there are examples of 2sg being ( re ) modeled on 1sg , robert hoberman pointing out that this is what happened in the perfect of ge ' ez , and i have since also found discussion of this happening in some yemeni arabic dialects , but the 3sg is not affected in any of these cases ) . alexis manaster ramer

reminder of coling-acl ' 98 workshop deadline ( cvir ' 98 ),"call for papers coling-acl 1998 workshop content visualization and intermedia representations ( cvir ' 98 ) august 15 , 1998 university of montreal montreal , quebec , canada workshop description : in the last few years , multimedia systems have become available which integrate text , graphics , sound ( speech and non-speech audio ) , as well as animation . there are many different communities working on such systems ( e . g . , hypermedia , human-machine interaction , information retrieval , scientific visualization , content extraction , dialog tracking ) , each with distinct concerns and goals , and often the communities are not aware of each other 's research and methods . this workshop aims to bring together these communities to examine the questions of the visual presentation of diverse content through multiple media . the major goal is to explore common intermedia representation languages which are expressive enough to cover diverse modalities yet suitably appropriate for the individual media . with increasing amounts of data , information , and knowledge available to the user , the effective use of visualization is increasingly important in applications . examples include : # visualization of data in scientific literature , including support for interactive information retrieval ; # business and finance data visualization ( data profiling ) ; # automated or assisted map , graph , diagram , or image construction from text or data ; event , process , and knowledge editing and visualization tools ;

glow ' 99,"call for papers : glow 1999 the glow 99 colloquium will be organized by the research center for general linguistics ( zas ) in berlin from 29th to 31st march 1999 . the conference will then continue in potsdam on 1st april with parallel workshops organized by the potsdam university and lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) . themes of the conference main colloquium : universals workshops : phonetics in phonology sources for universals technical aspects of movement calls : the colloquium : universals the search for universals has always been at the center of interest in generative linguistics . fundamental claims about universal properties of language are what we build into the very architecture of the theory of ug : primitives ( features etc . ) , combinatorial operations ( merge ) , the operation ' move ' , interfaces with extralinguistic systems ( lf , pf ) , etc . alongside such formal universals , we also seek substantive universals in inventories , markedness patterns , feature hierarchies etc . such facts may reflect properties of ug itself or derive from extralinguistic sources . recent growth in crosslinguistic study opens new opportunities for extending the empirical base , confirming or challenging old generalizations and establishing new ones . at the same time , recent theoretical developments in both phonology and syntax lead to important questions concerning the formal and / or substantive nature of universals in language , and the quest for the exact sources of variation between languages . in phonology , universals have typically been assumed to exist in many different subcomponents , e . g . features , prosodic constituents . only in recent years , with the emergence of output-based evaluation systems , has the focus of interest in universals shifted to the study of constraints and their interaction . hence new questions arise : are all constraints universal in the sense that they are constitutive of grammar ? should we conceive of constraints as being exhaustive and ordered ? are there universals that constraint orderings have to obey ? are there different domains ( i . e . lexical and postlexical level ) where constraints apply ? are there language-specific constraints ? syntactic theory in the early 80 's assumed principles common to all languages to interact with various types of ' macro-parameters ' : one deep property from which several other properties derive ( e . g . pro-drop parameter ) . later , variation was attributed to ' micro-parameters ' . now , with the emergence of minimalism and optimality , basic issues like what constitutes a universal principle / constraint , and what constitutes a parameter , need to be re-addressed . is there a universal inventory of functional heads / features ? as to the autonomy of , or the division of labour between syntax and morphology : is parametrized variation confined to inflectional systems ? is syntactic variation restricted to the choice of overt or zero realization of a given feature ? if all movement takes place in a single cycle , does variation reduce to the presence of affixes or the lack thereof ? are there universal constraints in morpho-syntax ? moreover , in recent years it has been argued that thematic relations are features . what are their characteristics ? do these have a universal inventory ? could they be parametrized ? many typological-descriptive generalizations await theoretical integration - e . g . greenbergian ' universals ' of word order patterns , cross-categorial harmony effects , etc . in this respect , kayne 's proposal for a universal ordering merely shifts the burden from phrase structure to movement . a guiding heuristic of generative grammar has been that parsimonious ( redundancy-free ) theories are to be preferred ; but minimalism goes further in suggesting that economy is built into ug itself . to what extent can the hypothesis that ug principles instantiate notions of economy be upheld ? in studying ug , we take the external systems with which it interfaces to be invariant in linguistically significant senses across individuals and languages . thus we posit universal interpretation mechanisms ( and uniformity across languages at lf ) , ' universal phonetics ' ( invariant articulatory / perceptual mechanisms ) , a universal parser , etc . ; so that variation is confined to grammars , in particular phonology / morphology and&nbsp ; aspects of the lexicon . yet properties of external systems may have far-reaching consequences for our view of ug . as we learn more about them , universals attributed to ug may have to be reassigned . what if ug - compatible grammars determine languages that cannot exist because they are unuseable ( unparseable ; unlearnable ; etc ) ? are there universal patterns in the acquisition process , in parsing strategies , etc . , that can be brought to bear ? the colloquium will consist of 20 talks of 45 minutes each plus discussion . abstracts may not exceed 2 pages with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font not smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in tenfold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation to : glow selection committee c / o artemis alexiadou zentrum fr allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , typologie und universalienforschung jgerstr . 10 / 11 , 10117 berlin germany phone : + 49-30 - 20192404 / 1 fax : + 49-30 - 20192402 e-mail : glow99 @ zas . gwz-berlin . de url : http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de / events / glow / index . htm the workshops 1 . sources for universals recent developments in syntax and phonology such as the minimalist program or optimality theory have led to new insights into the structure of the human linguistic capacity . in the context of such theoretical developments , the conviction has grown that recourse to innate properties of language cannot be the only explanation for the existence of certain generalizations of formal linguistic structure . the idea of the workshop "" sources for universals "" is to bring together researchers from various fields inside and outside of syntax and phonology in order to identify possible sources for formal universals of natural language . such possible sources could come from the following domains , semantic universals consideration of processing difficulty considerations of laws of historical development for languages considersations of constraints on language acquisition biological constraints in the sense of a "" universal grammar "" constraints inherent in the computational mechanisms serving language , this list is not meant to be exhaustive . contributions which link formal universals as discussed in recent grammatical models to any of such sources are particularly welcomed . 2 . technical aspects of movement filler - gap dependencies ( fgd ) belong to the most intriguing properties of natural language grammatical theories have to deal with . finding the right approach continues to be a matter of no little controversy . capturing the core properties of fgds , concepts of strictest c-command , which require fillers and their gaps to be immediately attached to the same projection line , arguably possess a high amount of naturalness or simplicity . this type of constraint is directly reflected by linear indexed grammars and has been implemented in the minimalist extension condition on structure building . ( attempts to derive the c-command relation from the minimalist operation merge take this strategy even further . ) yet , head-movement configurations , analyzed as adjunction in the principles and parameters variant of generative grammar , seem to require weaker versions of c-command , such that the adjoined head ' inherits ' the c-command domain of the head adjoined to . it is an open question , whether there are alternatives that do not - one way or the other - employ similar auxiliary devices . as is well known , fgd - patterns ( nested / crossed ) have consequences for the generative power of the grammars describing them . it is not properly understood , however , which devices of which systems capture less orderly patterns best . systems using slash-categories or similar techniques seem to run into considerable difficulty here . feature - lists integrated into a checking theory of movement may be considered one of various alternatives . most recently , the minimalist adoption of the "" copy theory of movement "" opened up another array of related issues . how , for example , do checking resources get eliminated if each step leading to elimination is preceded by a step of copying these resources ? are copies of np / wh - moved constituents assumed to retain properties of empty anaphors and syntactic variables respectively , or has any reference to empty categories ( e . g . ecp ) and their potential link to binding theory become undefined ? if the latter , could this change be motivated by complexity results concerning the powerful device of free indexation , as employed by gb binding theory ? indeed , a general ban on the use of indices has been accompanying the "" copy theory of movement "" . this calls for a demonstration how chains , the standard "" legitimate lf - objects "" , which in alternative versions of syntax are supposed to fully supplant movement , get handled without such devices . primary properties to be defined on chains of copies , for example , would be pf - realizability as well as the distinction between operator , variable , and descriptive content status at lf ( nontrivial consequences for the analyses of qr and acd being directly implied ) . alternatively , it would be helpful to be able to appreciate how far any worked-out proposals deviate from structure-sharing techniques as used in hpsg / lfg ( a . o . ) , index percolation devices from variants of indexed grammar , and other structure generating systems like tree adjoining grammar or categorial grammar . this workshop invites submissions of papers shedding light on the above questions from both technical / formal and linguistic angles . abstracts for both workshops are invited for 45 minute presentations ( plus 15 minutes dicussion ) . they should not exceed one page / 500 words . please send five anonymous copies plus a camera ready original ( with author 's name , address , and affiliation ) to the address specified below . speakers will be partially reimbursed for their expenses on the scale that applies to the colloquium . glow workshops c / o matthias schlesewsky institut fuer linguistik universitt potsdam postfach 60 15 53 d 14415 potsdam germany phone : x49 - 331-977 - 2016 fax : x49 - 331-977 - 2761 e-mail : glow _ workshop @ ling . uni-potsdam . de url : http : / / www . ling . uni-potsdam . de / ik / glow . html 3 . phonetics in phonology invited speakers : edward flemming , donca steriade organizers : carlos gussenhoven , ren kager the workshop is broadly concerned with the relevance of articulatory and perceptual facts for phonological theory . more specifically , it intends to focus on such questions as the extent to which functional factors determine phonological grammars , the status of the distinction between phonological representation and phonetic implementation , the issue of multiple ( articulation-based as well as perception-based ) phonological representations , and the universality and ` groundedness ' of phonological constraints . the workshop will consist of approximately 7 talks of 45 minutes each , followed by 15 minutes of discussion . abstracts may not exceed one page with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font no smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in threefold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation , to glow phonology workshop c / o . ren kager utrecht institute of linguistics / ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht netherlands phone : + 31-30 - 2538064 fax : + 31-30 - 2536000 deadline for submission of abstracts : december 1 , 1998 submission by fax or e-mail will not be accepted .

sum : quantification,"about four weeks ago , in linguist 8 . 948 , i asked a question on behalf of the basque language academy 's grammar commission about the standard or recommended scope of "" quantifier "" and "" quantification "" as grammatical terms , with special reference to the function of "" so many "" and "" so "" in sentences like : there were so many students that we needed a larger classroom . the students were so intelligent that we needed to get another teacher . i wished to know whether it is considered terminologically appropriate to say that not only "" many "" and "" so many "" but also "" very "" and "" so "" quantify , and thus that the function of all of these ( including what i call degree modifiers ) is quantification . better to contextualize the terminological problem that motivated the question in the first place and to help clarify the following report / discussion , let me suggest , ad hoc , calling the two positions contemplated the "" quantifiers versus degree modifiers "" position and the "" quantifiers subsuming degree modifiers "" position respectively ; or for short , the versus position and the subsuming position . it is also only honest for me to declare at this point that my personal position has always been and continues to be that of the versus view , although i tried to word the original question neutrally . at this point i perhaps ought to note that several respondents seem to prefer to treat "" so many ( students ) "" and "" so ( intelligent ) "" as merely various occurrences of a single item "" so "" rather than treating _ so many _ as an "" item "" to be discussed in its own right . i view this as a manifestation of linguistic anglocentrism : unlike english , in many languages "" so many "" is not expressed by the item equivalent to english "" so "" plus a quantifier equivalent to english "" many "" , and since i was not particularly asking about english in my question , i reject the assumption that the english lexical composition of "" so many "" is of crucial relevance to the issue i raised . thanks to the following who responded to my question : bruce d . despain , patricia galea , e . h . klein - v . d . laaken , jan k . lindstrom , p . l . peterson and marilyn n . silva . a summary of their answers and suggestions follows , with an interjection of my own personal opinion at times , identified by my initials ark . marilyn silva supports the versus position , stating that "" quantifiers determine noun phrases , not adjectives . "" for "" very "" and "" so "" she prefers the term "" intensifier "" to my proposed "" degree modifier "" . patricia galea expresses the same views . ( [ ark : ] since my original question was not about the latter terms , i shall refrain from defending my preference of "" degree modifier "" over "" intensifier "" in this context ; larry trask 's _ dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics _ treats the two terms as interchangeble . ) marilyn silva also discussed what i called "" consecutive "" sentences , pointing out that the subordinate clauses in the two english examples cited above , "" . . . that we needed a larger classroom "" and "" . . . that we needed to get another teacher "" , are called "" adverbial clauses of extent "" in her treatment of english grammar , _ grammar in many voices _ ( ntc pub . group , 1995 ) . she considers that here "" it is the clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause "" . silva went on to point out that english clauses of extent can be licensed by a main clause containing _ so _ ( with or without _ many _ ) , as above , but also by one containing _ such _ , as in : george was such a gentleman that he never raised his voice . and draws our attention to the fact that _ such _ could hardly be called a quantifier . ( [ ark : ] this argument seems to be of general typological interest , independently of the fact that there is no real equivalent of this use of _ such _ in basque . ) in all these sentences with extent clauses , silva argues , "" it is the [ subordinate ] clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause . . . which merely licenses the subordinate clause . "" according to silva , then , _ so _ and _ such _ should not be lumped together with items like _ many _ or _ very _ in any case , in line with the view that they do not themselves quantify but merely license a subordinate clause which quantifies . looking beyond english , jan lindstrom pointed out that in swedish a single lexical item , _ mycket _ , functions both as a quantifier ( of nouns ) meaning "" much "" and as a degree modifier or intensifier of adjectives meaning "" very "" , providing the following examples : 1 ) da "" r fanns mycket folk . ' there was much people ' 2 ) hon a "" r mycket intelligent . ' she is very intelligent ' lindstrom does not seem to be defending a particular terminological usage in providing this observation , but merely wishes to offer useful information that may be of interest in the discussion . [ ark : ] it seems to me that while the interest of this sort of observation is undeniable , it does not obviate the need for a terminological distinction , nor does it justify the subsumes position , but rather illustrates the need for linguists to employ a clear meta-language to enable us to distinguish between items or uses even where , as here , their formal expressions overlap language-specifically . ( by the way , some other instances of the use of a single form for "" very "" and "" much "" include portuguese _ muito _ , catalan _ molt _ , and italian _ molto _ ; but i can think of many more languages that do not show this kind of overlap or homonymy . ) philip peterson wrote discussing in somewhat more abstract terms the actual semantics of terms like "" many "" and "" more "" , and referred me to his article "" complexly fractionated syllogistic quantifiers "" ( journal of philosophical logic , 1991 , 20 , 287-313 ) . bruce despain 's comments are oriented to language-specific issues of syntactic classification of quantifiers in english that are not likely to be relevant to a description of basque , for which reason i shall not report his suggestions here . henny klein brought to my attention the following bibliographical reference : gary , e . ( 1979 ) extent in english . a unified account of degree and quantity . phd thesis , university of california , los angeles . in summary , none of those who responded favoured the subsuming position according to which "" very "" and "" so "" can be referred to as quantifiers or their function as quantification ( unless that was what jan lindstrom wished to imply ; it is my understanding that it was not ) . four of the six answers do not actually lean one way or the other . the two answers that address my question directly and suggest an answer , those of silva and galea , both constitute votes for the versus position . eskerrik asko denoi ( many thanks to all ) alan r . king , ph . d . alanking @ bigfoot . com alternative email addresses : mccay @ redestb . es , a @ eirelink . com , 70244 . 1674 @ compuserve . com snail : orkolaga plaza 3 1a , 20800 zarautz , basque country , spain phone : + 34-43 - 134125 / fax : + 34-43 - 130396 visit my web page at - - > http : / / www . eirelink . com / alanking /

books on semantics,"john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new title in the field of semantics : nominal classification in aboriginal australia marc harvey & nicholas reid ( eds . ) university of newcastle / university of new england 1997 . x , 296 pp . studies in language companion series , 37 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 848 5 price : usd 89 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3040 4 price : nlg 178 , - - this volume aims to extend both the range of analyses and the database on nominal classification systems . previous analyses of nominal classification systems have focused on two areas : the semantics of the classification system and the role of the system in discourse . in many nominal classification systems , there appear to be a significant percentage of nominals with an arbitrary classification . there is a considerable body of literature aimed at elucidating the semantic bases of classification in such systems , thereby reducing the degree of apparent arbitrariness . contributors to this volume continue this line of enquiry , but also propose that arbitrariness in itself has a role from a wider socio-cultural perspective . previous analyses of the discourse role of classification systems posit that they play a significant role in referential tracking . for the languages surveyed in this volume , contributors propose that reference instantiation is an equally significant function , and indeed that reference instantiation and tracking cannot be properly divided from one another . this volume provides detailed information on classification in a number of northern australian languages , whose systems are otherwise poorly known . contents : introduction ; nominal classification and gender in aboriginal australia ; new guinea ' classificatory verbs ' and australian noun classification : a typological comparison ; head classes and agreement classes in the mayali dialect chain ; head and agreement classes : an areal perspective ; class and classifier in ngan ' gityemerri ; nominal classification in marrithiyel ; noun classes , nominal classification and generics in murrinhpatha . contributions by : mark harvey ; nicholas reid ; fransesca merlin ; steve powell robert ; alan rumsey ; nicholas evans ; ian green ; michael walsh . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com

innateness,"i should n't get involved , but here goes : joe stemberger < stemberger % ellvax @ vx . acs . umn . edu > writes > > one last statement implicit in much work in linguistics : "" i have no theory > of genetics , ontogeny , or evolutionary biology , but i ' m sure that if i did , > modern linguistic assumptions about innateness would fit in real well . "" i do n't have my copy of "" the origin of species "" here , so i can't give a real quote , but the above lines remind me forcefully of a problem early evolutionary biologists faced , one which darwin was painfully aware of . darwin had no "" theory of genetics , "" and in fact the then current ideas of genetics made precisely the wrong predictions for evolution . ( it was thought that a new trait would simply be blended in with already existing traits , instead of remaining a discreet inheritable trait . ) it was n't until mendel 's work on heredity was rediscovered ( in the 1930 's , if i recall correctly ) that the theory of evolution had a way of explaining why newly developed traits were not lost in a population like a single water drop would be lost in the ocean . the history of science is full of new theories that appear to have fatal flaws , but the theories are accepted anyway , in faith that an explanation will turn up later . ( another example is the idea that the planets revolve around the sun in space , rather than being attached to crystal spheres that rotate around the earth . what on earth : - ) holds them in their orbits ? ) stemberger also writes : > i ' ve never understood why it makes any difference at all to linguistic > theory whether highly language-specific information is innate or not . > > yes , it makes a lot of difference for e . g . language acquisition , but that 's > beyond the scope of what most linguists do . it 's not considered essential > to study the acquisition of warlpiri before you study the adult grammar , > most linguists study only adult grammar , and the main principles of grammar > have come from studies of adult grammar . it makes no difference if you ' re simply writing grammars that attempt to be descriptively adequate ( in the sense of "" descriptive adequacy "" that chomsky writes about in aspects ) . but it 's not clear to me that that is really a theory of anything . if , on the other hand , you want an explanatorily adequate theory of linguistics , you need to worry about how the learner comes up with the right rules . after all , no linguist , even the most brilliant , has ever come up with a descriptively adequate grammar of any language ; whereas every child ( down to some limit at the level of retarded children , i guess ) comes up with a way of producing and understanding his / her language in a descriptively adequate way . regardless of what you believe as to whether the child produces a descriptively adequate grammar , there is a great mystery here . if linguists have n't studied child acquisition ( they have , but stemberger is using a slight hyperbole here ) , it 's simply because they have made a decision about how to investigate the problem , not because they do n't thing that 's the real problem . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * mike maxwell phone : ( 704 ) 843-6369 jaars internet : maxwell @ jaars . sil . org box 248 waxhaw , nc 28173",0

l2 learning / cultural empathy,"a graduate student in education approached a colleague of mine with a query which linguist people may be able to help with . he is doing an evaluation of an exchange program with indonesia one object of which is to prepare more high school teachers of indonesia here in australia . he wondered if there is anything written on the correlation of degree of acquisition of an l2 with degree of empathy and participation in the culture of the l2 speakers . high involvement / skills might seem to be a good thing for teachers in both areas ; however negative aspects might be there . apparently there seems to be a correlation between development of good skills in the language and dropping out of teaching . could this be due to "" culture shock "" on return to australia of those who became most deeply immersed ? any references / ideas gratefully received . if there are a number , i could summarise . patrick mcconvell , anthropology , northrn territory university , po box 40146 , casuarina , nt 0811 , australia

double negation in black english,"i am wondering if anyone has done research on double negation in black english in recent years . i am interested in particular in an old claim of labov 's that double negation in be spreads across clause boundaries as in : ain't no cat can't get in no coop as it happens , i believe that labov was wrong and that this example illustrates a different phenomenon , namely , reinterpretation of such structures as consisting of a single clause ( with ' ain't ' becoming a negative marker . and i am looking for any relevant research .

coling - acl ' 98 workshop announcements,"below are two more coling - acl ' 98 workshop announcements : - discourse relations and discourse markers - partially automated techniques for transcribing naturally occurring , continuous speech seperated by : * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * call for papers coling - acl ' 98 workshop "" discourse relations and discourse markers "" august 15 , 1998 universiti de montrial montrial / canada ( see also : http : / / flp . cs . tu-berlin . de / ~ marker / aclcolingws . html ) the notion of discourse relation has received many different interpretations , some of which are hardly compatible with one another . nonetheless , there is a consensus among researchers that intersegment relations hold between adjacent portions of a text and that these relations may be signalled by linguistic means , including so-called cue phrases , aspect and mood shifts , theme inversions , and other markers . the workshop intends to bring together researchers working on discourse relations and discourse markers in different linguistic traditions and different nlp applications . the particular focus of the workshop is the issue of discourse relations from the viewpoint of linguistic realization . specifically , contributions should address one or more of the following questions : o what are sound methodologies for comparing similar discourse markers ( contrastive studies , distribution analyses , etc . ) ? o what are sound methodologies for relating discourse relations with potential realizations ? o are there discourse relations that are always lexically signalled ? are there any that are never lexically signalled ? o what non-lexical ( i . e . , syntactic or prosodic ) means are used to signal a relation ? o in production , how does one decide whether to signal a relation at all ? o in production , how does one motivate a choice among candidate signals for a given relation ? o in production , how does the choice of signal interact with other decisions ( in particular , those of linearizing some tree or graph structure ) ? o in analysis , is it possible to reliably infer discourse relations from surface cues ?

english only,"i found the remarks of johanna rubba in a recent issue ( 6 . 967 ) to be very worthwhile and to the point . i would like to add a couple of points . in the vast majority of immigrants to the united states , the typical pattern of language acquisition is : the first generation may or may not learn english ; the second generation learns english natively and the parents ' language to varying degrees of proficiency ; the third generation learns only english - - and this is without any legislative intervention . there are strong pedagogical and psycholinguistic reasons for bilingual education programs for school-age immigrants and unassimilated children of immigrants . it is far easier to ` ` learn to read ' ' ( in the general sense , not in the sense of learning to read a particular language ) in one 's native language , and then learn to read the second language , than it is to learn to read ( in the second language ) and to learn the second language at the same time . - stuart luppescu | university of chicago | a foreign language is ` ` a weapon in sl70 @ cicero . spc . uchicago . edu | in the struggle for life .

innateness,"i made the following claim in my 22 - dec-94 posting : "" if x happens because y is innate , then this is a perfectly valid explanation for x 's occurrence ; if x happens for some other reason , then it 's not valid . "" i thought that this claim , being tautologous ( if we know what causes x , then we ' ve got an explanation for it ) , required no justification , but apparently i was wrong , since david powers ( 13 - jan-95 ) objects , on the basis that ` "" innateness "" amounts to saying "" because it [ ' ] s a fact of life "" . . . and saying that "" we are born with it "" is not an explanation . ' that is , apparently , even if we know that we are born with y , and that x happens because of this , we still have n't explained x 's occurrence . huh ? ( granted , we may now want to explain why "" we are born with y "" , too . but surely we ' ve got an explanation of some sort here , however partial it ultimately turns out be . and it 's got to be better than the relevant alternative : x happens because we learn x on the basis of "" general learning principles "" . ) i do think he has a legitimate objection to something , however , as discussed below . but first : perhaps i can put it another way , as i have elsewhere in the context of a fuller discussion ( "" on explaining the phoneme : why ( some of ) phonology { \ bf is } natural "" , bls 11 : 25-38 ( 1985 ) , p . 31 ) : a claim about innateness ( or lack thereof ) ` . . . should [ be ] evaluate [ d ] on the same basis [ as any other ] : does the evidence support the claim about innateness or does it not ? it would be just as wrong to claim that something that is innate is not , as to claim that something that is not innate is ' . it is true that making a claim about innatenes without evidence reveals "" laziness of the mind "" , but so does making a claim about lack of innateness . powers continues : ` . . . the science comes when we show ( a ) the sufficiency ; ( b ) the necessity & ( c ) the source of the posited [ innate ] constructs . ug is concentrating on ( a ) and there is a tendency to deprecate those who are interested in ( b ) and ( c ) - which go beyond the bound set by innateness . ' if ` ug ' really is out there running around making innateness claims solely on the basis of sufficiency arguments ( and i do n't doubt that some folks do this , alas ) , then i can understand why innateness has gotten a bad name . translating into syllogism-ese , such an argument would have the following form : "" y is innate "" entails x ; x is true ; therefore y is innate . logicians have a name for arguments of this form : "" affirming the consequent "" ; this is a classical logical fallacy . but , while individual practicioners may be guilty as charged , it is at least not always the case that innateness claims are made with disregard for ( b ) : arguments from "" the poverty of the stimulus "" , the unavailability of negative ( ungrammaticality ) evidence , and the ( alleged ) lack of errors by children that violate structure dependency are all clearly cases in point . ( see , e . g . , chomsky 's _ reflections on language _ . ) note further that my requirement in the above quote is stronger than requiring just ( a ) and ( b ) : "" y causes x "" entails "" y is necessary and sufficient for x "" , but not vice versa ( e . g . , if z causes both y and x ) . and , while i agree that deciding to pursue ( c ) should not be grounds for deprecation , neither should , i would think , deciding not to pursue it . this elephant is too big for any one "" blind man "" to figure out alone ! don churma , dept . of english , ball state univeristy , muncie , in 47306

"words that are their own opposites : sum , cont 'd .","here are some explanations of three famous types of auto-antonymy . bob fradkin gives us the auto-antonymy of verbs of covering / uncovering , chuck bigelow follows the english blackening of indo - european ' white ' , and david gamon explores how modal expressions may come to mean their opposite . * * * bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) writes : dust is part of a series of noun-verb conversions related to coverings of things . if the noun gives a covering that is natural to the thing , then the verb means "" remove the covering . "" if the covering is imposed , the verb means "" put the covering on . "" so you get "" shell an egg "" "" peel a banana "" but "" paint the furniture "" "" wax the floor . "" dust is interesting because it can go either way : "" dust the furniture "" ( a sort of natural covering to be removed ) vs . "" dust the crops "" ( put stuff on them that they did n't have and would n't unless humans put it there ) . i mentioned this in my english grammar book "" stalking the wild verb phrase "" ( univ . pr . of america 1991 ) at the end of chp . 3 . * * * chuck bigelow ( bigelow @ cs . stanford . edu ) writes : ) from historical linguistics , a well known example of a word 's meaning shifting to its opposite is english "" black "" , of which the indo - european root is * bhel - ' to shine , flash , burn , be white ' etc . another modern reflex of * bhel is "" bald "" - ' having a shining or white head ' . from a variant of * bhel - , * bhelg - / * bhleg - ' to shine , burn ' comes germanic * blakaz ' burned ' , and thence old english "" blaec "" - ' black , that which has been burned ' . nifty . ( i ' m using calvert watkins ' dictionary of ie roots , houghton mifflin , as reference . ) * * * david gamon ( gamon @ garnet . berkeley . edu ) writes : enantiodriomia refers to the diachronic process of acquiring an "" opposite "" meaning , and i suppose a word having two such meanings would be an enantiodrome . i learned this , by the way , from professor matisoff here at berkeley . enantiodromia of modals / attitudinals the first example of such a word i had drawn to my attention is * doubt * , which historically has a meaning such that to doubt that something be true meant to suspect it to be true . in some parts of northern england , i ' m told , it still has this meaning . this was brought to my attention by professor bill stewart at cuny . another example i ' m familiar with is the english modal * must * , which is reconstructed as meaning "" to have freedom or space "" ; the gothic cognate meant "" to be free or have permission ( to do something ) . "" there are two classes of explanation offered in the literature for this particular example of enantiodromia . first explanation : negation drops out klaren ( 1913 ) and antinucci and parisi ( 1971 ) propose that the semantic shift took place in a negative context , as follows : neg ( free to do x ) - - ) compelled ( neg ( do x ) ) given the equivalence of a lack of freedom to do something and a compulsion to not do something , an innovative "" compulsion "" semantics was reanalyzed from the "" freedom "" semantics in a negative context with concomitant scope change of the negative operator . the reanalysis is made esepcially perspicuous given a & p 's notation , which decomposes the older meaning of the modal ( freedom / persmission ) into the primes neg ( bind ( neg ) ) : if one is free to do something , then one is not bound to do it ; if this is negated , the first two negs cancel out to leave only the narrow-scope neg , with a resultant meaning of bind neg or "" compelled not "" with narrow-scope neg , as follows : cause ( x ) ( neg ( neg ( bind ( neg ( john goes out ) ) ) ) ) [ = j . may not go out ] - - - ) cause ( x ) ( bind ( neg ( john goes out ) ) ) [ = john must not go out ] the same sort of explanation could be applied in reverse to the german modal * duerfen * , which underwent a semantic shift from an original "" necessity "" or "" compulsion "" semantics ( cf . mod . germ . * beduerfen * "" need , require , "" * duerftig * "" needy , poor , lacking "" ) to the modern "" permission "" meaning : bind ( neg ( do x ) ) - - ) neg ( free ( do x ) ) however , the a&p notation fails to link the conservative and innovative senses in a natural manner . second explanation : antithetical nature of modality the other kind of explanation has been proposed by breal ( quoted in bech 1951 , p . 19 ) , visser ( 1963-73 , p . 1797 ) and traugott ( 1989 ) , and basically proposes that permission is used as a polite way of imposing obligation , with the implication subsequently being semanticized , or the originally indirect speech act giving way to direct , conventionalized coding . one might see the same sort of shift occurring in present-day english in contexts that suggest that this sort of explanation may indeed be valid , as in "" you may leave now . "" one can see from this , at least , that what counts as an "" opposite "" is largely a matter of the scale one implicitly chooses along which to arrange the items at issue , or the specific semantic prime upon which one chooses to focus . also , one would n't even think of conceptualizing the innovative meaning as antonymous if most of the conservative meaning were n't being preserved intact . another example is * prove * , which in middle english meant something like "" to test , "" or in a legal context , "" to put on trial . "" when the expression "" the exception proves the rule "" was coined , it quite logically meant that an exception or counterexample to a generalization or claim makes you question the generalization or that the exception so to speak puts the rule on trial . as the verb * prove * shifted its meaning 180 degrees , the expression , illogical though it then became , was preserved simply because it 's so handy - - whenever someone presents counterevidence to your claim , you can write it off as "" the exception that proves the rule "" ! ( it 's interesting , by the way , how many "" folk "" justifications there are of the sense of this idiom - - but that 's another story . ) references antinucci , francesco and domenico parisi ( 1971 ) . on english modal verbs , cls 7 : 28-39 . bech , gunnar ( 1951 ) . grundzuege der semantischen entwicklungsgeschichte der hochdeutschen modalverba . copenhagen : ejnar munksgaard . klaren , g . a .
