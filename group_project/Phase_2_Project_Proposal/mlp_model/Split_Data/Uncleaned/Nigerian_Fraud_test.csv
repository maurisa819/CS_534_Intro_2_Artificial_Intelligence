Having forseen the caputilation of Saddam Hussein government my late husband quietly moved his family (my two kids & I) to Europe and tried to desert the Iraqi Army to join us in Europe, but was cought up  with by the dangerosu secret security mechinary  of Saddam. He was brutally murdered on the order of Saddam himself and all our properties and estate including bank account were consficated by the infamosu regime.

Coast, my father died during the political war crisis
that going on in my country here in ivory coast(cote
d'ivoire)My mother died when I was a baby when she was
about to delivers a new baby and since then my father
took me so special. 

Before the death of my father on november 2002 in a private hospital herein Abidjan he secretly called me on his bed side and told me that he has the sum of Eight Million,Five Hundred Thousand
United State Dollars. USD($8.500,000) left in one of
the private security/finances trust services house
here in Abidjan Ivory Coast ,as a family treasures
that he used my names her only daughter for the next
of kin in depositing of the fund. He also explained to
me that he might not survive the situation he was at
that present.

However That I should seek for a foreign partner in a
country of my choice where I will transfer this money
and use it for investment purpose such as real estate
management or hotel management.

Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance
in this regards again.Your suggestions and ideas will
be highly regarded.


Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 
(1)Can you help me for the retrievements of this fund
on my behalf in the security custody here to your end?

since I am only 22 years old?

(3)Can you make an arrangement for me to come over to

I really don't want to struggle anything with them in terms of properties but my presence will still be disturbing them. thank God they are not aware of this fund in the company here hence, I want to
leave here as soon as you help me to have the consignment cleared from the security company here and lodge it into a safe account in your stable country and then send me some amount to enable me prepare to

to travel and clear it myself alone with my little or

Hello my dear friend,

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and may offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent and writing through this channel.I got your contact from searching for a reliable and honest person that will assist me safeguard fund.Divinely inspired to pick your name among other names found after series of prayers/fasting for Gods direction.I am Mrs.Susan Wright Jose Ceasar.person from South Africa undergoing medical treatment.I was married to

Dr.Jose Wright Ceasar who worked with Malaysia embassy in South Africa for nine years before he died in the year 2000.We were married for twenty years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. 

 Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.6 (Ten Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars)with one finance/security company in EUROPE.

 Presently,this money is still with the Security Company.Recently,my Doctor told me that I have six months to live as I am terminally ill with cancer.Though what disturbs me most is my partial paralysis.Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church/mosque or better still a Christian/Moslem individual that will

utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.I want a  church/Mosque or individual that will use this to fund churches/Mosque,Orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.They said blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be mis-used by unbelievers.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner,hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of God.If you will be of assistance,I will surely appreciate and reward you for your kindness in rendering help to a dying woman.

The Manager of,
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B.)
Ouagadougou, Burkina-Faso.
Direct Line +226 76 40 64 06.

Dear Friend,
Please read carefully, This is secret and confidential.

I hope that you are well today.I am the Manager of Audit and account dept of 
our bank, with due respect i decided to contact you over this business 
financial transaction worth the sum of FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS, (15Musd)in 
other to entrust this fund into your bank account.

This is an abandoned fund that belongs to the one of our bank customers who 
died along with his entire family on 25th July,2001 in a plane crash 
disaster. I was very fortune to meet the deceased file when i was arranging 
the old and abandoned customers files of 2000-2001 in other to submit to the 
bank managements accordingly for documentation purposes. Following our 
banking financial policy, it was obviously indicated and signed law fully 
that if such money remains unclaimed after five years without somebody been 
a foreigner apply and claim the fund as the next of kin , the money will be 
transferred into the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed fund.

So the request of you as a foreigner is necessarily needed for the claim 
because a citizen of Burkina Faso cannot come forward to claim the fund 
since the law does not permit an indigene to claim such fund Since the real 
beneficary of the fund is died , the bank are expecting the next of kin to 
apply for the release of the fund for him or her without delay but 
unfortunately i learnt through the investigations which I carried out that 
there is nobody behind who can come and claim the fund.

Therefore I want you to apply to the bank with your reliable bank account 
details where our bank will transfer the fund into and immediately the fund 
is transferred into your account ,i will share the fund according to the 
percentage indicated below.
SIXTY PERCENT (60%) of the total fund will be for me.THIRTY PERCENT( 30%) 
for you in provision of the Bank account.FIVE PERCENT(5%) will be for 
unexpected expenses which may occur during the transfer.FIVE PERCENT(5%) 
will be preserved for helping the helpless people, like charity organization 
and motherless babies.

Thereafter you will help me to visit your country for sharing the money 
according to the percentage indicated above.

And for the immediate transfer of this fund into your bank account as 
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as the only existing next of kin 
to the deceased customer and after approval which will take place 
immediately as you applied, the transfer of the fund into your nominated 
bank account will proceed. Please note that you should keep this business 
secret until you confirm the transfer into the bank account which you will 
provide. And there is NO RISK in this business. The bank will forward to you 
all necessary documents related to the transfer and which will prove that 
you make a legal claim of inheritance.

It is true that i pray to GOD before i was pushed forward to contact you for 
this business but i want you to assure me solemnly that you are a 
trsutwothy,reliable,honest and capable to avoid cheating me in this 
business.If you are really sure of your integerity, Reply immediatelly you 
receive this mail and call me on 00226 76 40 64 06  for more detailed 
information on how the process to transfer the fund into your account will 
be.
Yours faithfully,
Mr Raj Mohammed.

  Dearest one, 
      Grace and peace be multiplied unto you.
  I know my mail might be a surprise to you but never mind because I am contacting you in good faith. There are certain times in ones life
that whether or not one indicates interest for certain assignment,
people would look up to him/her for assistance. 
      I'm Miss Naomi stephane, a 23year old ophan from the Republic of Zimbabwe. 
      During the current crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of President Robert Mugabe to claim all the
white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to
surrender their farms to his party members and their followers.
My father however was one of the best farmers in the country, hence the supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated his properties (i've earlier lost my mom in my teen). So, after the tragic incident i decided to relocate to Cote d'ivoire (where dad told me he has money saved in a reserve company) for safety.
       Before dad actually gave up in the hospital, he told me that  he deposited the sum of $5,200,000,( five million two hundred thousand dollars) in a private security(reserve) company as family valuable property in a trunk box for safekeeping of the fund.
   He also gave me the documents which was given to him when the money was deposited. 
    The following are the documents:  (i)Certificate of deposit                   (ii)Agreement of deposit          (iii)Receipt of deposit payment.
     
   Dad told me while on his dying bed to tranfer the money abroad in an enabling enviroment and use it for profitable adventures.
        Please, I want you to know also that this money is the only hope we have for our future survival as our greedy relative made do with whatever remains of the party supporters loot except this fund which they're not aware of.      
     However, at present there's political uprising in the country where we are and the Northern Region has been seized by a separatist rebelious group that are also causing disturbanses in the commecial capital where i live at present.
       My purpose of contacting you is for you to help me retrieve the fund and provide a bank account abroad (in your place) where i will transfer my inheritted fund and assist me to come over to your place and use it for profitable ventures in partnership with you.  Though you will be the initial manager since i'm more interested in completing my education which has been interrupted by my fathers demise.

       Based on the experience i suppose you possess living in a developed economy, I believe with that esteem knowledge in the business world my money will be properly channeled in a viable/profitable business venture. 
   
      I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum if you will assist me in good faith.
    'Looking forward to hearing frm you
                                        Best regards,

I am a Ghanaian married with two kids.

I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us. As the 
regional manager of the bank, it�s my duty to send financial reports to my 
head office in the capital city of Accra.

On the course of the last year 2005 end of the of the year�s report, I 
discovered that my branch in which I am the manager made Six Million Five 
Hundred and Fifty Thousand US Dollars ($6,550.000.00) of which my head 
Office is not aware of and will never be aware of. I have since then PLACED 
this fund on a SUSPENCE ACCOUNT without a beneficiary.

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus 
I am compelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into 
your bank account.

I intend to part with 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me.
I do need to assure you that there is practically no risk involved in this.  
It�s going to be a bank-to-bank transfer.

All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund.
If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response.

mike odey <modey06@go.com>,modey06@go.com,"Fri, 22 Aug 2003 20:00:18 -0700",REQUEST,"Attn:My dear friend

I am Dr Mike Odey, the Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos 
Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for 
you.

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian 
National 
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) 
Deposit 
for 
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty- five Million 
Dollars) in my branch.  

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got 
no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered 
from 
his 
contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that 
Mr. Barry 
Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I 
found out 
that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next 
of kin 
to date has fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry 
Kelly did 
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, 
including his 
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is 
still 
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the 
principal 
sum 
at the end of each year.  

No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, 
at the 
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of 
the 
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, 
my 
proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the 
next of 
kin 
to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old mans labor will not 
get 
into 
the hands of some corrupt government  officials.  

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names, 
address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the 
necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the 
next of 
kin. We shall employ the service of another Attorney for drafting and 
notarization 
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of 
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will 
then 
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of 
kin.  
The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in 
the 
ratio 
of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on 
either 
sides during the course of this transaction.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will 
be done 
by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the 
successful 
execution of this transaction. Upon your 
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant 
documents 
that will help you understand the transaction better. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this 
transaction 
would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your 
assistance 
to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you 
soonest.

Best regards,

Dr Mike Odey.

Tel/Fax: 44 703 189 2908 
MANCHESTER (WA) 20515 
 
Greetings, 
 
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because I believe everyone will die someday.  My
name is Mr.CAMPBELL WILLIAM, from NEW ZEALAND, I have
been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which was
discovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying for
my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and
right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts. 
 
I have since lost my power of speech and can only
manage to write now, as that has been the only way I
am able to communicate. I have not particularly lived
my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone
not even myself but my business. Though I am very
rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to
people and only focus on my business as that is the
only thing I cared for 
 
But now I regret all this as I now know that there is
more to life than just wanting to have or make all the
money in the world. I believe when God gives me a
second chance to come to this world I would live my
life a different way from how I have lived it. Now
that I know my time is near, I have willed and given
most of my properties and assets to my immediate and
extended family members and as well as a few close
friends. 
 
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and
so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I did on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in UK, Brazil and
Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly,
I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts and
donate the money, which I have there to charity
organization in Bulgaria and South Africa, they
refused and kept the money to themselves. 
 
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not
to be contented with what I have left for them. The
last of my money which only few of them knows of is
the huge cash deposit that I have with my Bank in
ABIDJAN. I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.
waiting for reply.
 
Regards, 
MR Campbell William

(STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL)
FROM THE DESK OF ( MR.YSOUF AROUNA)
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT /FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BF
REQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY INTO YOUR 
ACCOUNT.

You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't know me 
in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your impressive 
information through an international business equiry .

But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it will open 
doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us.
This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of your 
business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair for 
profitable business is needed .

Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of 
auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN 
DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m 
US dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who 
died along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.

Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased 
anindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all 
his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside
with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t 
want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe 
fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next 
of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, 
inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after 
I will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the 
percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number,
your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication 
and location where in the money will be remitted .

On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by 
email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials 
confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the 
payment Agency. I willbe handling official
protocols here and expect you to undertake international responsibilities as 
I am assuring you of a risk free transaction provided you display maturity.

Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my
email address .

Thanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.

I contact you in such a surprising manner,but i respectfully insist 
that you read this mail carefully as i am optimistic that it will open 
DOORS forunimaginable financial reward for both of us. It is my pleasure 
to introduce to you a business that will make the beginning of 
never-ending family relationship. I hope that this proposal will not be an 
inconvenience or
embarrassment to you.


I must not hesitate to confide in you this simple and sincere request 
business for our mutual benefit.I am Mrs FLORENCE ACHIAH RUSANGANWA, the 
only Daughter of late Mr.Steve Achiah Rusanganwa{Snr}, a BEJA TRIBE 
MEMBER of EASTERN SUDAN in
Republic of SUDAN. I am 25 years of age. My father was a prosperous 
coffee and tin ore merchant in KHARTOUM, capital of the Republic of SUDAN 
before his untimely death. After his business trip to Abidjan - Cote 
d'Ivoire, to negotiate
on a Coffee and tin ore business he wanted to invest in Abidjan ? Cote
d'Ivoire.


A week after he came back from Abidjan, he was attacked with my mother 
by unknown assassins suspected to be Darfurian Rebels under the Sudan 
Liberation Army/Movement (SLA/M) and the Justice and Equality 
Movement(JEM) who were demanding an end to alleged economic marginalisation and 
sought power-sharing within the Sudanese state believed that my father 
has been given financial support to Beja Militia Rebels. After my 
parents death,i was aided by our church pastor,a good friend of my father 
through Chadian capital, N'Djamena to escape to ACCRA-GHANA.


But before my father gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was 
going to die,He disclosed to me that he deposited the sum of 
USD$18,500,000 (Eighteen Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) 
in cash
concealed in (2)two trunk boxes and deposited it with a private 
security house here in Accra Ghana which he declared and register as FAMILY 
VALUABLES, because of political problems here and there.


My late Father signed an agreement that the consignment should only be 
released to a foreign trustee of my choice or release it to me when i 
will become 29years old. So I want you to please assist me stand as my 
nominated foreign trustee and claim the boxes from the security company

processing plant for a company which he wanted to establish in Abidjan ? 
Cote d'Ivoire.

gunneddown.But since I have no experience or interest in this type of business,i am 
seeking a reliable and trust worthy business partner who will assist me 
to secure,claim-out and transfer this funds abroad strictly for 
investment purposes and for guidance.


Now I am soliciting for your assistance to help me to claim-out and 
transfer these 2 trunk boxes to your destination or abode, holding on my

Dear friend, 

On behalf of my colleagues and I,I write this letter with great pleasure. Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government)delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation,with co-operation of two other top officials,we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm,which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$18,300,000.00(Eighteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand UnitedStates Dollars)
 . Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor,leaving the excess balance unclaimed.The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general,and foreign direct investment in particular,are the 
real engines for sustainable economic development,for which reason it has continued to encourage investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere 
determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them,so as to continue to enjoy close relationship,and a mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its 
approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 30% while my colleagues and I shall receive 60%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies.More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts,and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.
This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your Specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.Kindly notify me by email engridris_moha@myway.com  for further details, upon your acceptance of this proposal.

Your Sincerely,
Engr.Idris Moha.

who worked as the financial director under United 
Nation Development Programmed for Africa for more than ten years before he died in 
the year 2004.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness 
that lasted for only four days. 
Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided 
not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home, which the bible is 
against. When my husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$16.8Million United 
State Dollars (Sixteen Million Eight 
Hundred Thousand Dollars) with a London ALPHA SECURITY COMPANY in my name.
Presently, this money is still with the security company; recently, my doctor 
told me that I would not last long due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs 
me most is my partial paralysis sickness. Having known my condition I decided to 
keep this fund in the security company. I want an organization or an individual 
that will use this fund for 
orphanages, Widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house 
of God is maintained.

The bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this 
decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my 
husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be 
used by unbelievers. I don,t want a situation where this money will be used in 
an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death 
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the 
lord. Exodus 14 vs. 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my 
peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regards because of my 
health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don?t 
want them to know about this development but I can call you if you send your 
number across. With God all thing are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the security company, that you 
are the beneficiary of the said consignment you will need to go and claim this 
fund. I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present 
beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the 
organization to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness 
is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the 
lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through 
you're your life.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this 
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. 
Hoping to receive your reply and remain blessed in the lord. You can contact my 
pastor Rev Marvin Smith, He is willing to 
assist us to conclude this transaction peacefully or Email

Yours in Lord,
Dr.(Mrs.) Owens Mary.

Dearest One,
 
A PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE.
 
It's my pleasure to contact you for an investment assistance which I intend to establish with you in your country.
 
Though we have not met with you before but I believe, one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life. However is not mandatory nor will in any manner compel you to honour against your will.
 
 I am the only daughter to the Late Markeni Enfandy, from the Nshili District of Gikomgoro Province in the Republic of Rwanda. My Father before his death was a successful Gold and Cocoa Merchant in Johannesburg, South Africa and Ghana. Barely a week my father returned from his usual European business trips, on Wednesday 14th June 2004, he was attacked and killed by some unknown assassins together with my dearest Mum.
 
The Police could not trace the killers till today, and because I do not know those behind my parents brutal killing and their reasons, I felt out of fear that my safety is not guaranteed, that is the reason why I decided to relocate with the help of the International Care to Abidjan in Cote D' Ivoire (formerly Ivory Coast) to save my life. 
 
They loved me so much, and I was like their confidants to them before their untimely death, as such my Dad gave me information&#30196; where he kept the documents on the very huge amount .(USD$10.500,000.00) 
 
Which he kept for the family. Presently the money is in a Courier's Company Bonded Warehouse called the (IVSF) (full information&#30196; to be disclosed later to you on confirmation of your acceptance to assist me.
 
I have decided to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Africa for security and political reasons and because of the problems in where I am now (Abidjan).
 
 I want you to stand as my appointed beneficiary whom will receive the consignment on my behalf since it was deposited for shipment which stands the best way to retrieve the deposit.
 
Note: The Courier's Company does not know the exact content of the box, as the content was declared to be classified documents and valuables. 
 
The shipment was done with Diplomatic Immunity [not to be inspected by any authority].
 
If you can be of assistance to me I will be pleased to offer to you 10% of the total fund for your assistance and your advice for the investments.
 
I hope to hear from you soonest for us to proceed.
 
Thank you and God bless you 
Yours Sincerely, 
Miss Aranima Enfandy

Compliments Of The Day,

Permit me to introduce myself to you. My name is Dr Bennie Mcarthy,A Top
Management Official of one of the finance
corporation in johannesbourg south Africa.

I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable
person/company to handle an important assingment on behalf of my 
Colleagues and myself.As a matter of fact, I got your information from Miss
Natasha Johnson of The International Affairs Department Of The South African
Chamber Of Business.


Proposition, A German Mr. Wolfgang Schinister, 66 years of age and a prosperous
oil\\Gold merchant had in our Bank the sum of
$35.5million in a domiciliary account.

Unfortunately, he was killed in the recent plane crash involving
concord AF4590 in Gonesse, France. Efforts had been made by the 
management of my bank through the German Embassy in johannesburg to contact
any of the deceased children but to no avail,as we were made to understand
he  had no children.Given the skeletal information available to the bank,
it has so far been impossible to reach any of the relatives.

The situation left for the Management is to declare the deceased
account dormant and revert the Amount to trading on behalf of the interest
of the Bank. In order to avoid this development, my Colleagues and I now
seek your approval to have you stand as a distant relative to Mr.Wolfgang
Schinister,so that the money would be released to you. All documents and
proofs to enable you get the money will be carefully packaged once we receive
your consent on this proposal.I shall Apply for a leave as soon as the funds
gets into your reliable account to come to your country for possible sharing
and investment opportunity which you will assist me in doing. May I assure
you that this is safe and risk-free, as we have taken care of all necessary
modalities to ensure a hitch-free movement. I have the authority of my
partners involved in this assignment to propose that should you be willing
to assist us in this,your share would be 25%.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me.

Dear sir, I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of works and Housing in Nigeria. Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction.Hence our desire to have an overseas agent. I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction. The deal in brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use. For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent. Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction, all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us . As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use o!  ur own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . It might interest you to note that last year, a similar transaction was carried out with one MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but after securing the payment approvals, and payment effected, MR.CHIENCHEN YU changed his numbers and addresses, and was no where to be found on our getting to Taiwan.  That was how we lost US$7.5Million. So this time around , I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen. You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal, through email. After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly destroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of the personalities involved.

SAVIMBI <savimbi098@netscape.net>,R@C,"Fri, 04 Jun 2004 16:30:15 +0200",THANK YOU,"Good Day,
I know you will find this surprising,please pardon my surprise. With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,and I hope this mail meets you in good time.I have mused over your profile for sometime and decided to contact you in this regard. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past,I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mr.Robert Savimbi,I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. 
My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death,Mr. Antonio Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were his second in commands, assumed office as leaders of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo and general lukamba,
there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose them and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension
and confusion in UNITA became uncontrollable when Mr.Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now
desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek political asylum.
I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (Eighteen Million Dollars Only), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank
account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam,Netherlands. in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited
for sometime now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to the netherlands to sought for political asylum here is because of the safe deposit. 
President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.
I plan to use this money to safeguard my families future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.
Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name from the Security and finance company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 
For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with Fifteen Percent of the Money of the money. 
I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.
I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 
Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

I wish to solicit your kind and urgent assistance.My name is Mr.PATRICK AGOLO, a lawyer based in Lagos State of Nigeria.As a lawyer, I was a private legal adviser (for almost two decades) to a white couple who unfortunately lost their lives 3-months ago in a ghastly motor accident here in Nigeria. Prior to their death, this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately, they died childless, with no knownrelatives or next of kin.
 
The issue at stake, for which I am writing you now, is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated.
Soon after the burial of the deceased, I had promptly notified the bank,which is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased.
 
Incidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you, to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased.
 
 As a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person.
I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done, the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours.
 
My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently, indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.
Pls. keep these disclosures confidential.
Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
Barrister PATRICK AGOLO(ESQ)

FROM:MRS.MABEL NDLOVU
ATTN:
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me
since you don't know me personally,but for the
introduction,I am MRS. MABEL NDLOVU,the wife of
Late DR.ONOMUA ANDREW NDLOVU who was recently
murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe.
I got your contact from the INTERNATIONAL TRADE
CENTRE here in Johhanesburg and decided to write
you.My Husband was among the few black Zimbabwe rich
famers murdered in the cold blood by the agents of
the ruling governmentof President Robert MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean
opposition party,controlled by the white minority.
Before his death,he had taken me to to deposite the
sum of Five Million Dollars US$ 5M.with a security
and finance company as if he knew the looming danger in
Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as
gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security
company. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new farm
machinery and chemicals for the establishment of our new farm in
lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when president
Robert MUGABE introduced a new land act,which wholly affected
the rich white famers and some blacks vehemently condemned the
modusoperand""adopted by the government. This
resulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the war
veterans and some political thugs presently,more
than SIX-HUNDRED[600]people have so far been killed.Heads of
government from the west,especially The Great Britain and The
United states of America have voice their condemnation of
MUGABE'S plan.The South Africa development community (SADEC)has
continuously supported MUGABE'S new land reform
Act.It is against this background that I and my Children who are
currently staying as REFUGEE in a SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC but
currently seeking An ASSYLUM in any of THE THE WEST AFRICAN
COUNTRIES have decided to transfer my late Husband's money into
a foreign
account. As the only and LEGITIMATE -WIFE of my late
husband I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a
genuine foreign account where this money could be
transfer without theknowledge of my country's
government who are tatically freezing our
familieswealthback home in ZIMBABWE and The South
Africa government seems to be playing along with
them. I am faced with the delimma of investing this amount of
money in The South Africa Republic for the fear of encountering
the same experience in future since both countries have almost
the same political history.Moreso ,the South Africa Financial
foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence
I am seeking for Assistance.As a business person whom
I must entrust my future and that of my family on his
hands,I must let you know that this transfer is 100%
RISK FREE . Therefore if you accept to assist my family,we are
willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assitance,70%
for me and my family,while 10% will be mapped out for all
expenses.I would wish to invest in your country on REAL- ESTATE
based on your advice and I would also receive assurance that you
would'nt sit on this money when transfered into your personal
or company account. If this PLEA is acceptable by you please do
send me your personaldetails,Name and Address,telephone and fax numbers .
You should know that this business is highly confidential and shall
be kept within you alone.I hope to hear from you soon
on the  email address bellow.

Thanks,

Best Regards,
MRS MABEL NDLOVU.

CITIBANK ,
332 Oxford Street,
London, W1N 9AA
Dear Friend,
I am Mr David Wood the Bank Manager of CITIBANK 332 Oxford Street,
London W1N 9AA.
I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On
August 6, 1997, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the
BRITISH PETROLUEM CORPORATION Mr. HAFFEZ AL SADIQUE.
Made a numbered time (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months,
valued at US$29,500,000.00 (Twenty Nine Million Five hundred Thousand
Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity in 2000, I sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, the British petroleum corporation that Mr. HAFFEZ
AL SADIQUE died as a result of torture in the hand of Sadam Hussein
during one of his trips to his country Iraq. On further investigation,
I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to
trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that mr HAFFEZ AL SADIQUE. did not declare
any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank
Deposit paperwork in my Bank.
This sum of US$29,500,000.00 have been floating as unclaimed since 1997
in my bank as all efforts to get his relatives have hit the stones.
According to the British law at the expiration of 8 (eight) years, the
money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund and the eight years is the end of july
2005.
Consequently, my proposal is that i want to seek your consent as a
foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money as the next of kin to
the deceased so that the bank will transfer the money to your
designated account. All documents and proves to enable you get this
fund will be carefully worked out. I have secured from the probate an
order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries, and more
so I are assuring you that the business is risk free involvement. Your
share stays while the rest be for me and for investment purpose as i
will leave London by the end of the year.
The sharing of the funds will be based According to agreement within me
and you. As soon as i receive an acknowledgement of receipt of this
message in acceptance of our mutual business proposal, I will furnish
you with the necessary modalities and disbursement ratio to suit both
parties without any conflict. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do
not take undue advantage of the trust i have bestowed in you.
PLEASE, APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT DOING BUSINESS OVER THE INTERNET IS
RISK.ENDEAVOR TO SEND YOUR CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER IN
YOUR REPLY TO THIS BUSINESS.

Regards.

My Dear Friend,
 
Compliments of the season.I did like to send to you the best wishes of 
good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my 
proposal as contained in this letter. i may not wish to disclose how I got 
your email address for now. After due deliberation with my son,I decided 
to forward to you this business proposal, we want you to assist us .I 
will give you more information. As to this regard as soon as you reply.

I am  Mrs. Rita Diatta . I am contacting you with the hope that you 
will be of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the 
sum of 14.3 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment 
purposes. I therefore personally appeal to you seriously and 
religiously for your urgent assistance to move this money in to your country 
where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the 
restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the 
Senegal Government.

This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my 
husband and a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my 
husbands share .Presently, the   Government has intensified their probe 
in to my husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of 
all our accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business 
licences and the arrest of my First son.
In view of this I want  to acted very fast to withdraw this money from 
one of our finance houses before it will be  closed down.My husband  
deposited the money in a finance firm   for safe keeping . No record is 
known about this fund by the government because there is no 
documentation showing that we have  such funds.

Further more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four 
years following the death of my late husband for charges of State organized 
murder and corrupt practices which my husband died in detention. My son  
was just been released by the Supreme Court after the president 
brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he is still under 
interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital documents.
Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to 
my family,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help 
in transferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund 
here  and to invest the money to profit my family  Bearing in mind that 
you may assist me.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.

I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly 
atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can 
start all over again if only you wish. I shall ask my son Mohammed to 
come over to your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies 
you. please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this 
information
in total trust and confidence.
 
Please kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal 
telephone and fax numbers. Conclusively,we have decided part with 25% of 
the total sum. of the total sum,10% will be for expenses incurred during 
thecause of this transaction, while 65% is to be held on trust by you 
until we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country 
subsequent to our free movement by the Senegal Government.
 
I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.

Dear Sir 
My name is LOI C. ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located in the South East Asia. 
My husband was recently impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. 
My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. The present government is forcing my husband out of manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. 
During my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. 
before my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold and my foreign business partner owned it. 
I am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. 
I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. 
When I receive your positive response I will let you know where the security company is and the payment pin code to claim the money which is very important. 
For now, all our communication is by e-mail because my line are right now connected to the Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. 
I will ask my son to contact you to give you more details , after i have received a responce from you.

from the EU, USA and other international governments and agencies. 
These moneies in all have ran into millions of dollars. 


As the officer in charge of receiving and managing these funds and 
executing the projects for which they are ment for, I have received 
all the money expected. I have also prepared my account which I have 
submitted to the AU High Command, and it has been approved by the AU 
Secratary-General, Dr. Amara Essy. However, in some of the money 
received, some of the donor countries and international bodies 
remitted to us amounts in excess of what they pledged. The AU before 
now, has written to all of them to acknowledge the receipt of the 
monies from them. The money in excess and which I have kept out with 
only me having knowledge of it, is in the tune of Thirty-Five Million United States Dollars (US$35,000,000.00). As it is now, this money belongs to me, as neither the AU nor any of the donor countries/international agencies has declared their money missing. 


I am therefore contacting you to assist me with the movement and 
safe-keeping of this fund. As a public officer in my category, I 
cannot openly put this money into any bank here in Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia, the AU headquarters where I am now, or in any other part of 
Africa, as an account holder. This will surely raise eyebrows and 
expose me. I have therefore concealed this amount of US$35M in four 
metal trunk boxes, and declared them as artefacts belonging to a 
foreigner. I deposited the boxes with a Security Company based in 
Spain which has an affliate offices in Ghana, Cot d'Ivoire and South Africa. These cities are safe havens for this kind of transaction. 

This transaction will however be hitch-free. So, I would therefore 
want you to be in Banjul, The Gambia for the clearing and claiming of 
this fund. I will furnish you with information/documents on how 

you will stand as the beneficiary of the boxes. I have decided to 
give to you 40% of the total amount involved. 

Please I will want you to contact me on this e-mail address or the 
alternative: (joe_mokoena@fastermail.com). 


Also, you have to assure me of the secrecy and confidentiality in 
this transaction. 

Thanks in anticipation of your valued co-operation. 

Mr. Jonathan Mokoena.

SOUTH AFRICA 

GOOD DAY , 
                            URGENT RESPONSE 

Let me start by introducing myself. I am MR JAMES TSHABALALA a bank manager with a commercial bank here in South Africa. I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable person/company to handle a confidential Portfolio that is under my supervision. During my visit to Pretoria, one of my associates there, in confidence gave me your contact address. With srong hope that you are my search, I decided to put before you this proposal. 

The Portfolio: 
A German man called Mr. Wolfgang Schiniter, 66 years of age and a prosperous farmer had deposited with us a sum of TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS(U.S.$20Million). His wife Mrs. Helga Schiniter is the legitimate beneficiary to this account. Unfortunately they were both killed in the air crash involving Concord AF4590 in Gonesse, France. 

Our serch through the german embassy to find any of the next of kin, have all proved fruitless. 

According to the embassy, the couple had no offspring. The Firm is still unrelenting in its effort to contact any of the relatives for possible claim of this money, or the fund will be transfared to the government cofferes. In order to avoid this development, my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a distant relative to Mr. Wolfgang Schiniter so that the funds would be released to you. 

All the documents and proofs of identity to further enable you get these funds will be worked out. 

We ""the Firm"", have secured the order of mandamus fom the court to serch and locate any of the deceased relatives. This is why I am asking you to present yourself as the possible closest next of kin.

I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount, I has also map out 10% for any expenses that might come during the process of the transaction, why 60% will be for me.  Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me If your good self accsept to this request, I will then commence with the procuement of the necessary documents to back your claim as the next of kin. 

Thanks, we wait to hear from you. 

Yours sincerely 

MR JAMES TSHABALALA.

  Your attention please:
  I am Barrister Khan Anwaar Faraad a Guinean Solicitor & Financial Attorney. I was the personal attorney to a client who was an expatriate mining consultant/contractor with Guinean Petroleum Corporation in Conakry , Guinea . The contractor here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond/Gold Merchant.
   
  He made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit of Twenty five million United States of America Dollars in one of the prime banks here in the state capital of with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity, the routine notification was forwarded to me that I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without a reply. After a month, I sent a reminder which I received from the bank without any reply again. Finally, I discovered from my Client's contract employers- Guinean Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in an auto crash along Lab express road. On further investigations, I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Conakry
 Guinea .
   
  First, I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Guinean law states that at the expiration of 5(five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Guinean Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund. 
   
  Secondly, as a foreigner, to stand in as the next of kin to him so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal. 
  I wish to point out that after the claims, I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly, I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice. If you are interested, please contact me immediately. Upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.
   
  I strongly believe every information is given for you to access my status before any further interactions.
   
  I go on anticipating your urgent co-operation.
   
  Thanks & Regards

This business will be of interest to you and your business and
involves $30,000,000.00, which emanated from over invoiced contracts executed
on behalf of my ministry of minerals and Energy, by foreign contractor.
Though the actual contract value has been paid to the original
contractor,GUILDER MINING (PTY) SA, now in-liquidation. We have however included
our billforthe over invoiced amount of US$30m amongst the present bills
that are scheduled for payment in the name of the company in-liquidation.

you will forward to us. I shall supply you with all the relevant documents

John Naveed <jnaveed1@hotmail.com>,jnaveed1@hotmail.com,"Tue, 20 Sep 2005 05:28:07 -0800",DEAR BELOVED,"Dear Friend,

Please as you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I 
believe everyone will die someday. My name is Mr. John Naveed, a merchant 
from Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Oesophageal cancer. It 
has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about 
a few months to live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well as a good person, as I never 
really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very 
rich, I was never Generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused 
on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all 
this, as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or 
make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would 
live
my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me 
and at the point of death, I have willed and given most of my property and 
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close 
family friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul, so I have decided to 
give
alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good 
deeds
I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity 
organizations
in the U.A.E, Malaysia and some countries in Africa. Now that my health has 
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do so many things by myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute 
the
money that I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, 
they
refused and selfishly kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust 
them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for 
them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of 
eleven
million dollars $11,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company 
abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to 
various charity organizations. I have set aside some part of this deposit 
for you as compensation for your time and any inconvenience this will cost 
you. You can also contact me on mr_johnnaveed@yahoo.co.uk

God be with you.

Dear Friend,
  
Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Jonathan Mutambara, In 
charge of Credit and Foreign bills of my Bank, AMALGAMATED BANK OF 
SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA).   I  have an obscured business suggestion for you. 
One of our accounts with a holding balance of Money Valued 
$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) has been dormant and has not 
been operated for the past six years.  
   
>From my investigations and 
confirmations, the owner  of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a 
citizen of Germany who perished in a plane crash [Concorde Air Flight 
AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard on 31 July2000. And for your 
perusal you can view this web site:http://news.bbc.co.
uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and since then nobody has done anything 
as  regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members 
who are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds.

Also 
Information from the National Immigration stated  that he was also 
single on entry into South Africa.
  
I have secretly discussed this 
matter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable 
foreign partner to deal with. In fact we could have done this deal 
alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants,we 
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually 
raise an eye brows on our side during the time of transfer since we 
still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a 
second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of 
kin with informations which will be made available to you.
 
This 
transaction is totally risk and trouble free as  the fund is legitimate 
and does not originate from  drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any 
other illegal act. 
   
The sharing of the fund between us, is as 
follows; 40% of the total sum will go to you for your effort and 
commitment to the success of this transaction. 60% for me and my 
colleague's. 
 
Forward your reply to jomutambara@fsmail.net

Tel: 234-1-7761675
Fax: 234-1-7592687. 
Dear 
My nameis MR MR.ODIASE GEORGE.chairman of the contract award committe of the.
Federal Ministry of Aviation. Sometime last year,the Federal Government of Nigeria decided to upgrade the Radar and Landing facilities at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport,kano inNorthern Nigeria.The contract ran into several millions of
Dollars. 

The contract was handled by a foreign firm but because of the
huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided toover-invoice the
contract sum. Now the contract has been completed and the
original contractor has since been paid, but the contract balance
of US$12.5 million, which resulted from the over invoiced
contract sum that has been left in a suspense account with the
CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA, is what me and my partners are planning
to take out of the country for ourselves. The problem is as
government officials, we are not supposed to own fat bank
accounts, talk less of having foreign ones. To this end, we are
soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us
and receive this amount into your account. We are ready to share
this money with you on the basis of participation. We also have
plans to invest part of this money in any viable business in your
country under your care, as we are very close to retirement age. 
In any case, I received a reference of you on the net while
looking for a potential and reliable partner. Please if you
accept my proposal do not hesitate to send me an e-mail, so that
I can provide you with the basic procedures for the release of
the fund. 
It does not matter whether you or your company does contract
project of the nature described here, the assumption is that you
won a major contract and subcontracted it to another company,
more often than not, big trading companies or individuals of
unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and
subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution. 
BENEFIT: For providing the account where we shall remit this
money, you will be entitled to 15% of the entire funds, 80% will
be for me and my partners, while 5% has been set aside to cover
any expenses that may be incurred by both parties during this
transaction, both local and international. 
Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost degree
of maturity and confidentiality because I am still in active
government service with the ""FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION"". If I
receive your response on time, this whole transaction could be
accomplished within the shortest possible time based on your
interest and determination, since the money is already in
transit. 
Please, try to reach me soon as there is no much time to waste on this . 
Yours faithfully, 
MR.ODIASE GEORGE

Office of the chairman 
Contract awarding committe 
Ecowas headquarters 
Lome,Republic of togo.

Attn:

Account provision for usd 9.5m

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you
asa surprise and if it might offend you without your
prior consent and writing through this channel.

I am George Ugo,The Chairman, Contract
Awardind Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST
AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters in Lome,
Togo.I got your information in a business directory
from the Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries
when I was searching for a reliable,honest and
trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was
simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the directory.

After discussing my view and your profile with my
colleagues,they were very much satisfied and deci! ded
to contact you immediately for this mutual business
relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of
USD9.5,000,000.00 (Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars only.)into your personal or
company`s bank account.

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract
bills awarded by us for the supply of ammunitions,
hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical items,light
and heavy duty vehicles, apperals and other
administrative logistics etc for the ECOMOG in
Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping
Projects.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully
protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed
off.As the Chairman of CAC,I have the cooperation and
mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of
the Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the
contract funds supplied by different companies from
different countries during the crisis. 

It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a
willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to
transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne
out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.

The original contractors have been duely paid by the
Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest
(Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is
suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by
any foreign company of our choice.We intend to pay out
this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its
activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the
countries and the coast has been achieved.

Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil
servants working under this organisation, are not
allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more
reason why we needed your assistance to provide an
account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping
and our future investment with your comprehensiv! e
advise,assistance and partnership in your country.

It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal
to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation,65%
will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used to
defray any incidental charges and cost during the
course of the transaction.

This transaction will be successfully concluded within
14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due
cooperation.You should provide the followings; 

YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL
AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)

THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX
AND TELEX NUMBERS.

THE ACCOUNT NUMBER

THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY 
WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

Upon the receipt of this informations,the documents
and approval with the texts will be sent to you for
confirmaton and then forwarded to the organisation for
ratification and subsequent payment.

As with the case of all organised (s! ensitive)and
conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved
confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We
hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable
business life afterwards.There are no risks involved.

Reply Asap. 
With Regards.

CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING OUR PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.

I ESCAPED WITH MY WIFE AND CHILDREN  OUT OF SIERRA LEONE TO GHANA WHERE
WE
 ARE PRESENTLY RESIDING  ON TEMPORARY POLITICAL ASYLUM.
HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION I DECIDED TO CHANGE MOST OF MY

BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO

EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES,HENCE I AND MY WIFE  ALONG WITH MY CHILDREN, DECIDED LAYING

OF
MY  CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE FRENCH
GOVERNMENT,AND AS SUCH WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR IDENTITY SO THAT OUR
INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND CONFISCATED.

SPECULATIVE
INVESTMENTS.

I am Sussan Adams 

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above 
named person. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I’m now 
in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who 
worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in 
the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He 
died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his 
death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not 
to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible 
is against. 

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million 
(Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, 
this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE 
COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 
SEVEN months due to my cancer 
problems. 

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I 
decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or 
muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to 
instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on, 
orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to 
understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision 
because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my 
husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard 
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation 
where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason 
for taking this bold decision. 

I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I 
am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the 
lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any 
telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of 
the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want 
them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. 
As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information, 
such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax 
number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of 
my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your 
nominated Bank Account in your country. 

I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as 
the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want 
you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my 
shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund 
when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a 
life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must 
serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through 
your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a 
church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me 
that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from

From:Mr. Patrick K W. Chan.

Good Day ,

I am Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan. Executive Director and Chief Financial
Officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Col. Hosam Hassan who was with
the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit
for 18 calendar months, with a value of Thirty Million United State
Dollars($30,000,000.00) only in my branch.Upon maturity several notices
was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after
the war another notification was sent and still no response came from
him.We later find out that Col. Hosam Hassan along with his wife and only
daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their
home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that our client
Col.Hosam Hassan did not declare any next of kin in his official papers
including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in
me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his
deposit in my bank. So, Thirty Million United State
Dollars($30,000,000.00)is still lying in my bank and no one will ever
come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws
of
my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds. Against this backdrop,my suggestion to you is that I will like
you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to  Col.Hosam Hassan so
thatyou will be able to receive his funds.

MODALITIES:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we
shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Col.
Hosam Hassan,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to
provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence
his job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also
fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and of
probate in yourfavour for the move of the funds to an account that will
be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we
are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the
necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in
all matters concerning this issue.

Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we
shall then share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you.Should you be
interested please send me your,

1,Full names,
2,Private phone number,
3,Current residential address.

And I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below;

(pkwchan_hk@yahoo.com.hk)

and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this
operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,

My Dear Friend,

I am Mr. John B. Castro, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Capital trust bank Benin, Cotonou, Republic of Benin West Africa, and also a special account officer of Mr. Peter Lund,European. He was a seasoned contractor with Benin Cement Company, Cotonou, who unfortunately died in a plane crash of Union Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727 in Cotonou, Republic of Benin on 25th December, 2003.You will read more stories about the crash on visiting this website:

2.www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/

Before his death on the 25th December 2003, Mr.Lund has a fixed deposit account with the bank and no other person know about this account or have any information relating to this account. The account has no beneficiary nor next-of-kin other than him, My investigation reveal that his supposed next-of-kin died along with him in the crash. Since then, I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.

After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you.I'm contacting you to assist in remittance of a dormant fund as the next of kin left behind by Mr.Lund so as not to allow the bank confiscate or declare the funds unserviceable in the account according to Benin Republic financial law on unclaimed bills which the government usually map out for the purchase of ammunitions which are the major course of conflicts in the west of  Africa. Consequently, I'm seeking your consent to present you as the next-of-kin to the deceased customer so that the outstanding fixed deposit (US$24.1M) will be remitted into any designated account of yours to be shared by both of us in the ratio of 60% to me and 40% for you.

I have all necessary legal documents to back up this claim. All that is required of you is absolute honesty, total commitment, co-operation & absolute confidentiality. Be rest-assured that this transaction will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect both parties from breach of the law and it is 100% risk free and attracts no authorities and every information you will require as the next of kin will be forwarded to you after your final acceptance to help me champion this deal.

DR. Taofeek Marvin.
taofeekmarvin@netscape.net  

Dear Friend,

I,DR Taofeek Marvin, the Director of Bills  & Exchange of the foreign
Remittance Department at  FIRST NATIONAL  BANK SOUTH AFRICA. I got your address while searching for trustworthy individuals in various countries. In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of $25, 5 million US Dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died with his family in the September 11th plane crash.

 Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come to our bank and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as a next of kin or relative to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed relatives died in the same plane crash leaving no relative behind to claim the fund. It is upon this discovery that l and other officials in my department decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relative to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not want this money to go into our bank treasury as an unclaimed fund.

 The banking law and guidelines here stipulate that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds. The request for a foreigner as a relative for this claim is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a South African cannot claim this fund as next of kin.

We agreed that 20% of this money will go to the foreign partner who will supply the foreign account, 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the transaction and 75% will be for me and my colleagues. Thereafter and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement of the percentages as indicated above.

If you are interested to assist in this transaction, kindly contact the writer on the above mobile number or private e-mail address. Please this transaction is risk free and you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for transfer.

Yours Faithfully,

DR  Taofeek Marvin

MR FRED OBI. <fredobi3@omaninfo.com>,,"Wed, 27 Nov 2002 13:45:46 +0100",URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE,"TRANSFER OF USD$22MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT}

ATTENTION: President\\CEO.

I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different
organs of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) owned
parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as
regards transfer of the above-mentioned amount into
your bank account.  This fund accrued from over
invoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatal
to certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago.

We, as holders of sensitive position in our various
parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government
to Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign
Contractors and we discovered that some of the
contracts they executed were grossly over-invoiced
either by omission or commission.  In the process the
sum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only)
was found lying in the parastatal suspense account
after the foreign contractors had been paid their
rightful dues for executing the said contracts.

We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount be
transferred (for our own use) into a bank account
provided by a foreign partner, because we are
government workers and the Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate foreign accounts.

However, we have succeeded in transferring some of
this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars
only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North
Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is
up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the
earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total
amount be paid into his nominated bank account before
disbursement will take effect.  If for a meagre sum of
US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not
compensated, is it when the balance of US$22M
(Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that we
will be sure of our full compensation? Of course, this
abuse of trust and inhumanity calls for sober
reflection and search for absolute trust.

Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance that
the remaining amount of US$22M can be speedily
processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank
account.  On successful remittance of the fund into
your account, you will be compensated with 30% of the
amount for your assistance and services.

So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive
positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction
neither can we give out identity as regards our
respective offices, but whereby cordial relationship
is established, smooth operations commences, you will
be furnished with details of all you deserves to know.

I am at your disposition to entertain any question
from you with respect to this transaction, so contact
me immediately through my e:mail for further
information on the requirements and procedure for this
transaction.

Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality and
utmost urgency.

Yours faithfully,

MR FRED OBI.

121 Old ojo road,
Pmb 224 Ikoyi,
Lagos-Nigeria.


Dear friend,

THIS IS THE TRUE STORY OF THIS MATTER

Please my name is Jones Usman a financial adviser to David a national of your 
country.He was an oil merchant here in Nigeria. On the 21st 1997, my client, 
his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along 
Ibadan Express road lagos. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost 
their lives along with the driver.

Since then I have made several enquiries in his Embassy to locate any of my 
client's extended relatives.After these several unsuccessful attempts,as a 
matter of fact,I decided to trace his relatives over the internet in order to 
locate any member of his family for a huge sum of fund deposited on his name 
in an offshore financial company overseas but that was to no avail, hence I 
decided within myself to contact you as his supposed relative since you are 
also a foreigner to avoid the offshore company from confiscating the deposit 
for theirs .

Please, I want you to assist me in repatriating the money left behind by my 
client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the UBN 
Finance company offshore payment centre where these huge deposits were lodged.

He had an deposit valued at about US$12M(Twelve Million US Dollars)and now 
the finance company has issued me an urgent notice to provide the next-of-kin 
or have the account freezed within the next ten official working days.

This was the last fund moved by my late claim to the offshore payment company 
of UBN for sefety by the oil merchant shortly before the autocrash that took 
his life and all in the car.This was as a result of the conflict emulated 
from the annulled june 12 presidential election by the military dictatorship 
Gen.Ibrahim Babangida which resulted to the death of many people in Nigeria 
even chief Moshood K.O Abiola that won the presidential race.

Since, I have succeeded in locating you today as his relative,I hereby seek 
your consent to present you as well as use your name and particulars apply as 
the next of kin to the deceased,so that the proceeds of this account deposit 
valued at US$12M can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money at 
last or invest with it for a profitable venture in your country, 50% to me 
and 50% to you.To present you as the next of kin will pose no difficulty as 
there is no risk involved hence i am the one presenting you officially.

I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up our 
claim.

2. Letter of Administration
3. Sworn Affidavit

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction 
through. I guarantee that this business proposal to you is 100% real and will

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. 
I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in 
good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.
I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the 
CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at 
US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was 
moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on 
the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. 
After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum 
Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to 
his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. 

On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nassers family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he 
did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any 
WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no 
one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not 
aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.
With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. 
By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of 
above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country 
immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain 
the source of the money. 
I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to 

late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of 
the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. 

All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under 
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are 
interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. 
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal. 
I wait your urgent reply through my private email address: arahkhrahman@yahoo.com.au

Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. Chris Swales and I work with a Bank here in  
London-England, The name of the bank is Barclays Bank. We had a  
Mr.Allen Duke, customer that had a deposit of US$4.8M (Four Million  
Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) before he died in a  
plane crash with his wife and only Child about 6years now (January 30,  
2000) and since he died, we in the Bank here have been expecting  
his/her next of kin/relative(s) for the inheritance of the deposit,  
but none has surfaced.

The policy of the Bank however stipulates a limited time period for  
such inheritance to be made or the fund will be written off going by  
the record of the incident, the time limit for the claim is closing  
up. In this consideration, I am contacting you to seek for your kind  
understanding and sincere co-operation to claim this inheritance for  
our mutual benefit.

If you can stand as the next of kin in this project, success is  
assured because I am in possession of the personal file jacket of the  
deceased which contains every needed information about the account and  
the deceased. You and I stand no risk of any kind because I have  
enough information to support you in claiming the inheritance.

The proceedings of the transaction will be shared 50% each after  
expenses are reimbursed. Kindly indicate your willingness by email on  
chriswales@katamail.com and we shall proceed with the initial step for  
the claim. The entire project is expected to last for about ten  
working days.

this issue. Also do not fail to furnish me with your direct phone and

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BF
REQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't
know me in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your
impressive information through an international business equiry .

But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it
will open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us.
This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of
your business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair
for profitable business is needed .

Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of
auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an
abandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in
november 2002 in a plane crash.

Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his
next of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation
to the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but
unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation
died alongside
with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my
department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and
I don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed
Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money
remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered
into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is
occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,
inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set
aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for

kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account
number,
your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective
communication and location where in the money will be remitted .

On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or
by email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide
materials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment
formalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official
protocols here and expect you to undertake international
responsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction
provided you display maturity.

the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my

ABIDJAN - COTE D'IVOIRE
PHONE: 00225 07 93 44 19

Dear sir

I wish to solicit your help in migrating to your
country and investing my funds.
Briefly, I am a Sierra Leonean National and the wife
of late Dr SIMON LAMINE.
Until his death, my husband was the General overseer
of the Diamond and Gold Mining Corporation in Kanema,
Sierra Leone. On April 6 2000 the military forces
loyal to the Government of Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH invaded
the Diamond and Gold mine and assassinated my husband,
mistaking him for his brother MIKE LAMINE who is the
deputy to the leader of the revolutionary United
Front (RUF ) FODAY SANKOH.

When the news reached me, I hurried gathered some
valuables in our family villa and escaped for my dear
life in the company of my only son PETERS.

Among the valuables was a file that contained details
of a Deposit my husband made in a security company in
Europe. He deposited US$ 15.5 M  contained
in 1 Trunk Box in the name of our son PETERS as
containing family valuables. He did not disclose the
real contents of the box to the security company.
Rather, he declared the deposit as Family Valuables
for security reasons. This is the money he made from
the sale of Gold and diamonds during his time as the
General overseer.
We need your sincere assistance to move this funds out from the 
security
company IN EUROPE for investment
in your country as we cannot invest here due to its
nearess to our country and the war still going on
there. Besides, our Refugee Status here cannot help
matters for us. We also ask you to scout for a viable
and lucrative business, so that we can invest wisely.

We have it in mind to give your 30 % of the total sum
(15.5 million US Dollars), and 20% share in any
investment we will embark upon if you assist us. We
will also set aside 5% of the funds for ancillary
expenses which you will make in course of this
transaction- air tickets and handling expenses etc.

This fortune we have revealed to you should remain
confidential as it only you who we have told about it.
pleaselet me have your phone/fax numbers for more detials.

Note that this transaction is risk free.
May God Bless you as you assist us.
Yours Sincerely ,

MRS ELISABETH / PETERS LAMINE

,prince_philip28@yahoo.com,,APPRECIATION!,"
With good faith i have come to you on this proposal
which i feel you
are liable of handling, and firstly i must introduce myself,i am PRINCE PHILIP
GARBI, the first son and manager of Mr. Garbi
Thembe, one of the most
popular black farmers in Zimbabwe who was recently
murdered in the land
dispute in my country.
I got your contact through network online hence
decided to write you,
Before the death of my father, he took me to
Johannesburg to deposit the
sum of US29 million ( twenty-nine million, 
United States
dollars), in one of the private security company, as
he foresaw the
looming danger in Zimbabwe, this money was deposited
in a box as family
valuables to avoid much demurrage from security
company. This amount was
meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals
for a new Farm
establishment in Swaziland.
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President
Mr.Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Reform Act wholly affecting
the rich white farmers
and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the
killing and mobbing
by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society. In fact a
lot of people were killed because of this Land
reform Act of which my
father was one of the victims.
It is against this background that, my family and I
fled Zimbabwe for
fear of our lives and are currently staying in the
Netherlands where we
are seeking political asylum and more so have
decided to transfer my
father's fund to a more reliable foreign account,
Since the law of
Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to
open any bank account
or to be involved in any financial transaction
throughout the
Territorial zone of Netherlands.
As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with
the responsibility of
seeking a genuine foreign account where this money
could be transferred
without the knowledge of my government who are bent
on taking everything
we have got. Since the South African government
seems to be playing
along with them, I am now faced with the dilemma of
moving this fund out
of South Africa for fear of going through the same
experience in future
because both countries have similar political
history.
As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I
have to entrust my
future and that of my family in his hands, I must
let you know that this
transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me
and my family all I
want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements
with the security
company to clear the consignment (funds) from their
affiliate office
here in the Netherlands as i have already given
directives for the
consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from
South Africa. But
before then all modalities will have to be put in
place like change of
ownership to the consignment and more importantly
this money I intend to
use for investment.
I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose
to have certain
percentage of the money for nominating your account
for this
transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me
for a proper
profitable investment in your country. Whichever
option you want, feel
free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this
money for all kinds
of expenses incured in the process of this
transaction. If you do not
prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of
the money while the
remaining 85% will be for my investment in your
country. Contact me with
the E-mail address while I implore you to maintain
the absolute secrecy
required in this transaction. Thanks, God bless you.
Yours faithfully,
PRINCE PHILIP  GARBI

Please accept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message of goodwill to you, I have to say that I have no intention of causing you any pains. My name is SENATOR VICTOR OYOFO,representing Edo North FederalConstituency,(, Pension Funds Committee in the senate of the Federal Republic Of Nigeria. I am writing you to earnestly Solicit your assistance in helping to receive some sum of money. I got your e-mail address on the Internet while searching for a reliable and reputable person to handle this transaction. THE PROPOSITION: We have the sum of US$25,200,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars) that we intend to transfer overseas through the assistance of a foreign partner.This money came as a result of the unclaimed pension funds belonging to a British expatriate petroleum engineer with the Nigerian National Gas Company,Engr.John Bruno. After all other pensioners have been paid their entitlements, we deposited this unclaimed sum of US$25,200,000.00,with the Debt Management Committee. In a bid to make sure Engr.John Bruno gets his due,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian Gas Company that Engr.John Bruno died, from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr.John Bruno did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents. This sum of US$25,200,000.00 is still sitting in an account of the Debt Management Committee and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 2 (two) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Engr.John Bruno so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so that I can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin to Engr Bruno. Upon this,we would then obtain the letter of probate/administration in your favor from a Federal High Court.A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and my partners,30% for you and 5% for any expences incured,during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done at the high court and my position as a member of the Committee guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.The fund shall be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down procedures governing transfer of funds. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address. Thanks and regards, Sen.Victor Oyofo.",1,1

(STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL)
FROM THE DESK OF ( MR. YSOUF AROUNA)
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT /FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BF
REQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't
know me in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your
impressive information through an international business equiry .

But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it
will open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us.
This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of
your business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair
for profitable business is needed .

Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of
auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an
abandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in
november 2002 in a plane crash.

Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his
next of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation
to the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but
unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation
died alongside
with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my
department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and
I don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed
Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money
remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered
into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is
occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,
inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set
aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for
me . There after I will visit your country with my family for
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of
kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account
number,
your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective
communication and location where in the money will be remitted .

On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or
by email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide
materials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment
formalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official
protocols here and expect you to undertake international
responsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction
provided you display maturity.

Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my
email address .

Thanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.

Yours sincerely.

MR. YSOUF AROUNA.

Sir,


RE: YOUR OUTSTANDING PAYMENT

 
The Coalition to Protect Contractors is a Non-Government Organization (NGO) formed in March 2006 by a group of activists, patriots and like-minds to protect the rights of Foreign Contractors in Africa. We have also extended our scope to include pursuit of payments for money inherited from the deceased. We are operating from United Kingdom at the moment for tactical reasons and have resolved to ensure justice is done for the money being owed you for long because of the unscrupulous activities, misdeeds, irregularities, exploitation, extortion, mess and disappointments by many questionable and unscrupulous characters in these African countries. Many Foreigners are being owed or purported to be owed in African countries for Contracts they have satisfactorily completed or for funds they have inherited from the deceased. The processes of claiming the unpaid sums have been very tortuous, stressful and frustrating. Your payment is pending. All manner of people have contacted you. We
  will ens
ure all people that exto

 
Stop any form of correspondence with any office/official with immediate effect and never pay one cent to any person again. Reply immediately providing/reconfirming the following information to facilitate our work - How much are you purported to be owed? State the origin, e.g. executed contract, inheritance e.t.c. Where is your money coming from; South Africa, Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, e.t.c?  What is the Contract Amount or Reference Number of Transaction? Provide your Receiving Bank Information. Have you been made to travel in the course of pursuing your payment? Have you received any part payment at all? Have you received any bogus Draft, Cheque or in deed any other instrument? Was there any attempt to pay you with the so-called defaced cash? How long have you been pursuing your payment? How much money have they extorted from you? Do you have any pending case in court to this effect?  Provide your direct telephone and fax numbers. It will be practically impossible t
 o make an
y progress on your case

Dear Friend,
Reply to:naybet@web-mail.com.ar

Your first reaction to this mail will be 
total rejection, scare and may be disbelief, 
owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days. 
 
But this mail comes from a devastated, 
sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs 
compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe 
away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian 
gesture.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel 
sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies 
someday.My name is Naybet Trabelsi a merchant in 
Dubai,in the U.A.E.I worked with Zambian Ministry of 
Mining and Resources for eight years as a contractor,
I have been diagnosed with Esophageal 
cancer .

It has defiled all forms of medical 
treatment,I am very worried as the doctors have 
informed me that its terminal.
I don't know how much time I have left on 
earth, hence this mail to you.
I have not particularly lived my life  
well, as I never really cared for anyone but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was 
never generous, I was always hostile to people 
and only focused on my business as that was the only 
thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I 
now know that there is more to life than just 
wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance 
to come to this world I would live my life a 
different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has 
called me, I have willed and given most of my 
property and assets to my immediate and extended 
family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept 
my soul hence, I decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of 
the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have 
distributed money to some charity organizations in the 
U.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health 
has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this 
myself anymore. I once asked members of my family 
to close one of my accounts and distribute the money 
which I have there to charity organization in 
Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money 
to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them 
anymore, as they seem not to be content with what I 
have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of 
is the huge cash deposit of $18,000,000,00 that I 
have with a finance/Security Company 
abroad. I will want you to help me collect 
this deposit and dispatch it to charity 
organizations.

I have set aside 20% for you and for your 
time.

God be with you.

With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
This letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to
Receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
and due to the rate of scam mails being sent around the world you 
might find it difficult to trust anyone,but please do not regrad this mail as such as i have all genuine documentsand facts backing my claims,and also a reputable security and financial institution in europe is were my funds is deposited.

However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction(TRANSFER), which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.

My name is HAROLD.A.MBEKI, the son of LATE STEVE ZHIRI MBEKI,
One of the most popular farmers from Zimbabwe, who was murdered in the
Land dispute in my country.As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for Contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
Business venture i intend to go into as soon as i get out this funds.

Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, and President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers,all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers  association and a strong Member of an opposition party that did not support the president's idea.

He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to
Invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They Killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm.

After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my
Father Reverened Theophilus Nnamni ,handed us over will documents with instructions from my father That we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him.

The will documents have a certificate of deposit, Airway bill confirming cash Deposit totalling Twelve million five hundred thousand united state 
dollars. [$12.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to 
the company (BRITISH INVESTMENT TRUST SECURITY COMPANY (NETHERLANDS) 
that the content is money hence it was deposited as PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for
Safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase
Of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in
Botswana.

This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of
My beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives.I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father
After he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger
Became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe
With the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from
Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left
With his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach
Him but all to no avail.

I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political
Asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because
the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have
Contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in
Johannesburg to The affiliate office here in Amsterdam The Netherlands
which they have finally confirmed to me that the funds has sucessfully 
being transfered to their branch office in AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS.
and that they are waiting further directives from me before they effect the transfer tomy nominated bank account.but due to my refugee status its being difficult for me moving this Money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum Seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial Transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable Partner and friend, whose account this money can be transferred after the consignment,hence your involvement in this venture.and that would be with the assistance of Advocate Smith.E.Fevinn
who has his chambers in DEN HAGG,in the NETHERLANDS who has agreed to stand by me till my funds is released, after hearing all my ordeal and verifying my claims from the security company.

You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big
And brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of
the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist
With arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from
their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred
>From Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here. The company will
be legally informed of you representing me.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
Choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me
Open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money
in your country.Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in
Your reply.

I have also set aside 1 % of the total sum $12.5M for all kinds of
Expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
For Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for
Your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left
in the account here for me.

Please note that this 1% is not with me at the moment but shall be 
deducted from The total contract sum as soon as the money finally hits your nominated account.because it is from this i% that i have to settle the barrister.

Finally I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of
This transaction.as i do not want anything that would jeopardise this
transfer,all my life soley depend on this funds to start up a better life as i have no one else to fall back to.as i have lost all i have gotten back home.You can verify my story at

With the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from
Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left
With his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach
Him but all to no avail.

I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political
Asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because
the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have
Contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in
Johannesburg to The affiliate office here in Amsterdam The Netherlands
which they have finally confirmed tome that the funds has sucessfully 
being transfered to their branch office in AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS.
and that they are waiting further directives from me before they effect the transfer tomy nominated bank account.but due to my refugee status its being difficult for me moving this Money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum Seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial Transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable Partner and friend, whose account this money can be transferred after the consignment,hence your involvement in this venture.and that would be with the assistance of Advocate Smith.E.Fevinn
who has his chambers in DEN HAGG,in the NETHERLANDS who has agreed to stand by me till my funds is released, after hearing all my ordeal and verifying my claims from the security company.

You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big
And brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of
the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist
With arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from
their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred
>From Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here. The company will
be legally informed of you representing me.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
Choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me
Open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money
in your country.Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in
Your reply.

I have also set aside 1 % of the total sum $12.5M for all kinds of
Expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
For Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for
Your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left
in the account here for me.

Please note that this 1% is not with me at the moment but shall be 
deducted from The total contract sum as soon as the money finally hits your nominated account.because it is from this i% that i have to settle the barrister.

Finally I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of
This transaction.as i do not want anything that would jeopardise this
transfer,all my life soley depend on this funds to start up a better life as i have no one else to fall back to.as i have lost all i have gotten back home.You can verify my story at rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html

mahoyi mamudu <mmahoyi@caramail.com>,mmahoyi@caramail.com,"Sat, 30 Nov 2002 17:32:20 -0000",respond asap,"Dear Sir,

Let me first apologise to you for any mbarrassment
this mail might cause you.
I am MAHOYI BELLO, a cousin to the Vice Presidentof
the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Alhaji Atiku) and
Executive Director of SADIQ PETROLUEM LTD.I have
decided to contact you for this business proposal
based on the mutual understanding I know that can
exist between us, having known that people of your
Country are trustworthy.

Since May 1999 when the new Government came to
power,large sums of money have been recovered from our
past military leaders who siphoned money from Nigeria
and deposited it in offshore accounts in
Europe,America,Asia and some parts of Africa, for
their own selfish benefits. This happened during the
military regime,Now we are under a democratically
elected government. This fund was among the money
recovered and seized by the Federal Government of
Nigeria. 

Hence, my elder cousin (Alhaji Atiku Abubakar) the
Vice-President of Nigeria is in charge of all
off-shore accounts seized and retrieved from our past
military leaders.Therefore, we urged you to assist us
provide a very vital offshore account, where the sum
of US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million) US Dollars
will be transferred for safe keeping. 

Presently, this money is in a foreign Country I cannot
mention now.Please note that other information will be
detailed to you on the receipt of your reply. My
elder cousin and I have agreed to give you (the
account owner)for this transaction 30% of the total
amount remitted while 60%is for me and Cousin Atiku,
for the purchase of foreign investments, with your
assistance after the money have been disbursed, while
10% is for expenses both of us will incur.

Note, I have been mandated by my elder cousin to
handle this deal with you, due to his position in the
Nigerian Government as the second citizen. Therefore,
if my proposal satisfies you, kindly contact me via my
e-mail address and enclose your phone and fax numbers
for urgent confidential discussion.Your letter of
acceptance indicating your personal telephone and fax
numbers to enable us move ahead.

Besides, this transaction is risk-free and hoped to
last 7 (seven) banking days upon my elder cousin
Alhaji Atiku Abubakar's authorisation.I thank you for
your expected co-operation. 

God Bless you.Best Regards.

MAHOYI BELLO.

,paul_kamara@yahoo.com,,CALLING FOR HELP,"  From Paul Kamara
Abidjan Cote D' I voire.
Email:paul_kamara@yahoo.com 

   
  Dear One,
   
  
For my safety and security of my future I am making this proposal to you for our mutual benefit. This however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour it against your will. I am Paul Kamara, 23 years old and the only son of my late parents Mr.and Mrs. Kamara. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously during one of his business trips abroad on the 4th october. 2005. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 2 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on 4th october, 2005 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of nine million, one hundred and fifty thousand United State Dollars.(USD$9.150,000)
 deposited in a bank here in Abidjan which he use my name as next of kin.
   
  He further told him that he deposited the money with my name as the next of kin, and finally told him to tell me where to find the documents of the deposit which he said was in possession of his lawyer in sealed documents held by him and asked me to collect it from him and all the necessary documents to this fund. I am just 23 years old and a first year university undergraduate and really don't know what to do.
  Now I want a trust worthy person who can help me to transfer this money  and provide an account overseas where I can transfer this funds.This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.
  Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
  1. Can you honestly take me as your own and help me.
  2. Can I completely trust you?
  3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the money is in your account?
   
  Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible so that i can forward the documents to you after we have agreed on the conditions for your assistance. My life is not safe here and i need to be out of here as soon as possible because now that my father is dead and with me only as a male child, my uncles will be seeking to kill me so that they can have all my fathers properties. i really don't want to struggle anything with them in terms of properties but my presence will still be disturbing them. thank God they are not aware of this fund in the bank hence, I want to leave here as soon as you help me to lodge it into  a safe account in your stable country and then send me some amount to enable me prepare to meet you. Without your help, i will find it difficult to travel and transfer it myself alone with my little or no experience.
  I am waiting for your urgent reply with your contact phone number so that i can give you the contact of the bank were my late father deposited this money 
for you to contact them as  my late father's partner. 

  
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards
Paul Kamara.

janetbradford@sunumail.sn,febregasagent@aim.com,"Tue, 31 Jul 2007 04:01:25 -0000",DEAR FRIEND,"Dear Friend.

I am Mrs Janet Bradford, am a widow and an International Oil merchant in
Dubai, United Arab Emirate and a member of Project Management Institute. I
have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late due to my
laxity in caring for my
health. It has defiled all forms of medical attention ; Right now I have
only about a few months to live, according to my Medical Consultant from
Germany. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really
cared for myself but for my the Oil business just because of the fact that
am a Widow with no feeling for love and sex from any man since i had lost
my lovely husband years ago!.

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business
as that was the only thing I cared for since i lost my lovely husband 12
years ago!. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to
life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.

I believed when God gives me a second chance and heal me I would livemy
life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my
healing and have willed and given most of myproperties and assets to my
immediate and extended family members and
as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I havedecided
to give arms to Charity Organizations and give succor and comfort to the
less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want
this to be one of the last good deeds I did on earth so far, by
distributing some of this money to some Charity Organizations in India.
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my
selfanymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts
in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to Charity
Organization and to the less privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan. They cashed
the money but kept it only to themselves. Hence I do not trust them
anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them
already.

The last of my funds/money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit
of Twenty Two Million United States Dollars ( US$ 22 Million) that Ihave
in the Vault of The Security Company in Europe as family valuablesince the
year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf
anddisburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia and for the less
privileged. Please sendme a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in
this disbursement. Iwill set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts.
I need your
urgent reply with the below complete information

Your Full names:
Your Residential Address:
Your phone/Fax numbers:
Your Age:
Your Occupation:

As soon as I receive this from you it will enable me go ahead andinform
the company where the said fund is deposited for the project.Be informed
that I will make sure I do all I can to ensure that thisproject work out
in the name of God .I will also plead to you to always pray for me because
only God can heals. I will advice you to also send your reply to my below

Dear Friend,
RE:REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

I,on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of
Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards
the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This 
fund arose from the overinvoicing of various contracts awarded in my 
parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago. We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, were mandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts.

We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank 
account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in united State of America,but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement
will take effect.

We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of of the amount for your assistance and services.

This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitive positions
we cannot afford a slip.
I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with
our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully
established and smooth operation commences. I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so, 
contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure. Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very great importanceb for security reasons.
Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency.

MARRIAM TAYLIR <marriam_taylor@yahoo.fr>,R@M,"Mon, 31 Jan 2005 13:15:53 +0100",MARRIAM TAYLIR,"FROM :Mrs Marriam Taylor 
Freetown-Sierra Leone. 
Please this business proposal is strictly confidential with due respect. 
Sorry at this perceived confusion or stress you may have receiving this letter, since we have not known or met ourselves previously. Despite that reason, please save us from this situation as I hope that this letter will not constitute an embarrassment to you.I decided to contact you because of the urgency of my situation here and with this, let me introduce myself. 
I am Mrs. Marriam Taylor (49 yrs.), the wife of Major Stephen Taylor, Chief Security Officer and Aide-de�camp to the president of Sierra Leone. who died during the Sierra Leone civil disturbances. I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I received from my husband younger brothers. They planned to take away all my husband treasury and properties away from me since the unexpected death of my beloved husband. 
Meanwhile I have four lovely children for my husband before his death (a boy and Four girls). My first and only son is twenty 24 years old and by name Samuel Taylor. I wanted to escape to the United Sates States with my children but they conspired together and stole my international passport and other valuable travelling documents. But luckily they did not discover where I hid my husband�s documents file where important documents are kept. So I decided to contact you confidentially. 
They have even closed all my husband bank accountsjust to put me and my beloved children into suffery and starvation. Now I urgently need an assistance of a reputable and trustworthy Foreigner like you to help me receive and subsequently invest on my children�s behalf the sum of US$ 10.000.000.00 (TEN MILLION DOLLARS), which my husband kept in a vault before his death. It therefore became very necessary and urgent that somebody in your foreign position should render a helping hand to safe-guard this fund for me in safe haven over there until my arrival in your country. 
It is my intention to compensate you with 20% of the total money for your services while 5% will be kept aside for any miscellaneous expensesincurred by both of us and balance kept for the good of my Children in respect of some good investments in your country or other country as you may advice me.The fund cannot be transferred or moved out through the banks via telegraphic transfer system because all eyes would be on me. 
This is the reason why I decided to contact you. Please all communications should be through this email address only for confidential purposes. Giving you my phone number will definitely expose all the transaction as any of them may eavesdrop to our confidential conversation. So the fund being a huge amount of money would require your help as a eputable businessman who can invest in any foreign country out side Africa. So to this end, I have devised a fool-proof method of crossing this cash by defacing the entire fund to avoid detection, seizure or diversion. 
And move this fund outside the country (Sierra Leone) as a diplomatic luggage with the help of a Courrier diplomat service-man. He will be ignorant of the actual content of the luggage and will help to deliver it outside the country where you go and take carefull delivery of the luggage and arrange the necessary banking formalities after normalizing the funds. With all the arrangements already put in place, the consignment will leave the country to a security company where it will be kept till your arrival there to take it along with you as mentioned above. 
As soon as I receive your positive response showing your interest I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this transaction sincerely. 
Awaiting your urgent and positive response. 
Thanking you in advance for your understanding and co-operation. 
Yours Sincerely, 
Mrs. Marriam Taylor

prime bank here in South Africa, On a routine inspection, I discovered 
a dormant domiciliary account with Balance of US$56,559,000(fifty six 
Million Five Hundred and Fifty) Nine Thousand U.S dollars Only).The 
account holder was in charge of President Saddam Hussein's secret crude 
oil transactions in Africa. On further discreet investigation, I 
discovered that the account holder died long ago with his family on a 
fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other 
person knows about it. I am in close contact with the bank manager here 
who is my partner and is willing to approve the transfer to any 
reliable and trust worthy foreigner with foreign bank account because 
the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner.

Pardon me if I have offended you by contacting you for such a big 
transaction through an ordinary letter which makes it suspicious 
considering the type of fraud proposals moving around the world today. 
 
However, I was advised to explain this transaction to you on a face 
to face meeting. I could not do this because of the situation in the 
world today not being sure of your reaction.
 
I am Jones Martin, a 
Consultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese 
Businessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company 
in Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for 
termination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and 
the oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid 
payment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of 
US Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
 
A special 
arrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with 
Japanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to 
terminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with 
an arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they 
prepared and handed over to The banker.
 
I was directly involved, well 
paid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was 
withdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault 
delivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.
 
The real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was 
delivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for 
the storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys 
were all handed over to me.
 
Mr. Takashi the Florida businessman was 
planning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when 
the unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster 
which claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me 
devastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit 
details to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change 
which was signed was still with the banker in his office which was 
lost.

Since last December the diplomatic storage manager has been 
calling me to bring or tell the owner to come over for collection. 
Since then, I have been finding any reliable person to collect these 
consignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came 
across your details. Be rest assured that this transaction has been 
well organized, 100% safe, legal, and should be kept very 
confidential. 

Signify your interest by getting back to me via my 
email as soon as possible.
 
Regard,

Manager National Bank of Abu Dhabi
Dubai Unted Arab Emirate (U.A.E.)
Email:sharaff3@simbamail.fm

I am Mr.Haitham Yousuf Branch Manager National Bank of Abu Dhabi), I 
have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
A British Oil consultant and contractor with the Kruger Gold Company,
Mr.Remond Beck made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar
months, valued at US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve Million United State Dollars
) in my branch. Upon maturity,
 
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his 
contract employers, the Kruger Gold Company that Mr. Raymond Beck died 
in a plane crash along with his wife Mr. and Mrs. Remond Beck died in 
a plan crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990, 1999 air crash
(for more information about this crash and person you can contact this
website: http://www.s-t.com/daily/11-99/11-02-99/d08ho174.htm
 
Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation,
I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to 
trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation
and discovered that Mr. Remond Beck did not declare any kin or relations 
in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in
my Bank. 
 
This sum of US$12,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest
is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No
one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of United Arab
Emirates, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to
the ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
 
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the next of kin to Mr. Remond Beck so that the fruits of this old 
man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and 
address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and 
affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.
We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/
administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part
of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of
this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. 
 
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of
60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork
for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the
Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email
address above. 
 
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe 
utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most
profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest
my share in your country.
 
Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential email address.
Regards.
 
Mr.Haitham Sharaff.

This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met,but it should not ,since we are determine to get what rightly belongs to us anyhow,but soon when every thing goes according to plan.The message could be strange but reality will definitely dawn on you,if you pay some attention to it's content.I would'nt have notified you but for the sake of your integrity and goodwill.Please accept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message to you.I have to say that i have no intentions of causing you any personal pains or discomfort.
I am MR Joseph Savimbi,Son of the late rebel leader Jonas Savimbi of Angola who was killed on the 22nd of February 2002.We are desperately looking for a trustworthy person to assist us in this Confidential bUSINESS.My late father,Jonas Savimbi deposited Huge Sums of Money realised from the sale of Diamonds and Precious stones/Metals in different Bank in Europe.My father is presently no more,and the movement of his family members(including me the son)is highly restricted.We are forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our immediate localities.Presently,the money realized from those sales amounting to US$25,000000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS),which my father realized,and was tranfered to Netherlands.Is safe in a security Firm,over there.Before you can get access to it you have to be given the password and the Personal identification numbers(PIN NO:)of the consignment deposited.I am therefore soliciting your help to have this money collected by you and transfered into your account,as I and my family would give you the neccesary documentions,to facilitate your collection of the consignment personally in Amsterdam,before the government gets wind of this arrangement.You know my father was a rebel leader in his life time before his death.
My reason for doing this,is because it will be difficult for the present Angolan Government to trace my father's money to an individual's account,especially when such an individual bears no blood relationship with us.I have decided to keep that Money for my family's use.Presently the money is still in that security Company in Netherlands.
I am currently and temporarily living in Luanda with my family seeking for my refugee status.moreover the political climate in Angola at the moment is very tense,sentitive and unstable.With this password and informations that we will give you,together with the Power of Attorney,you will then proceed to the security firm,and these will facilitate your collection of the consignment.You have to proceed personally to Netherlands where after fulfiling their requirements,the us$25,000,000.00 will be released to you in the two lage trunk boxes that it was deposited in,after which we may likely ask you to come over with some money for us to run away from here at least for now into one of these European countries.You can have the Fund tranfered into any account hat suits you,after your personal collection of the consignment,until further instructions are given to you by my family.
***PLEASE YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS HIGHLY REQUIRED.
Thank you very much for your time and understanding.
Yours Sincerely,
Mr.JOSEPH SAVIMBI

            SEEKING FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE 
              (TRANSFER OF US$15.5MILLION)

It is my pleasure to request your assistance on this business proposition which if pursued to its conclusion ,will be of immense benefit to both of us. This request may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is Col. Victor Aloma of the Democratic Republic of Congo I am one of close aids to the formal president of Congo Democratic LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.

For the military of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebles in my country, I was instructed by him (late president Kabila) to go to the Europe to purchase ARMS
AND AMMUNIATION worth us$15.5(fifteen million Five Hundred Thousand us Dollars) to fight the reble groups. But when it became ap! parent  that president
Kabila has been killed in a bloody shoot out by one of his aids. I immediately decided to divert the fund ( US$15.5) into  a private security company for safe
keeping. The money is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am currently in exile  after the death of president Kabila.

I need a reliable and trust worthy foreign partner/national who can assist me to clear and move this money as the beneficiary from the security company.

Though we have not seen nor met each other, but I would want this transaction to be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks, this money in question is state fund as it is a deal between you and I, hence the need for secrecy considering the security implications.


Thus, if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of the Netherlands, you can contact  me onthe above email addres to enable us discuss more about the deal and what  your percentage will be for assisting me.

Please note that you will be required to make a brief trip to the Netherlands for inspection of the fund. I also intend to visit your country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment.

I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.

Kindest  Regards,

COL. Victor Aloma

 My name is Mr. Fredrick Andrew. I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) of Singapore. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because a late investor , who bears the same last name with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all these years.
 

Banking regulation legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, working with you,since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor, we can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I crave your participation and cooperation.
 

I have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk .
 

Needless to say, Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until I hear from you. To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email, stating your full names, date of birth, telephone number and fax number. I do expect your prompt response.
 

pls do contact me in my email address[fredr_andrew@yahoo.com.sg].

Dear Sir/Madam,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.
I will introduce myself as a staff in the accounts management section of
a well-known bank here in the United Kingdom. 

One of our accounts with holding balance of Ł15,000,000(Fifteen Million
British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past
4 years. 

>From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account a foreigner
by name Austin Martins died in August 2000 and since then nobody has done
anything As regards the claiming of this money because he has no family
members who are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds.
Also Information From the National Immigration states that he was also single
on entry into the UK.

I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and
we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus
propose to do Business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these
funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have
been followed. 

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate
and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other
illegal act. On your interest, let me hear from you.


Regards,

Gordon.

I am interested in your partnership in business dealing. This business proposal I wish to intimate you with is of mutual benefit and it's success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality as regard this transaction.

I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account. 
 
The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$100,000,000.00 (One hundred  Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$115,500,000.00 (One hundred and Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval. 
 
As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided account.

 20% for you and 80% for us.

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTN: 
Compliments of the day and sorry for the embarrassment
my letter might cause you. I am Dr. Frank Bello, the
Executive Director Finance, of the Nigeria National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). 
Because of my position and that of other strategic
officials who are heads in their departments, we have
in our possession since 1997 the sum of US$60M Dollars
(Sixty million United States Dollars) which we amassed
through over invoicing of foreign contracts fully
executed and commissioned with the different foreign
Contractors duly paid their full contract amounts. 
Following the peaceful life ushered in by the current
democratic dispensation in Nigeria, I and my 
colleagues have decided to transfer the sum of US$60
Million into a foreign account operated by a foreigner
for onward transfer into our accounts. I request your
assistance in transferring and safeguarding the sum of
US$60M Dollars for our mutual benefits. 
For assisting us in transferring and safeguarding this
fund, you will be entitled to 35% of the total sum, 
60% belongs to my colleagues and me while 5% will go
for reimbursement of all expenses made by both 
parties. 
It is imperative to note that this transaction is risk
free as my colleagues in the relevant ministries have
perfected all modalities for the successful transfer
of this fund. 
However, we should see absolute confidentiality as our
watchword throughout the course of this transaction
for we are civil servants and will want to safeguard
our jobs, so as to receive our pension, since we have
put in a lot of years on active service for the
N.N.P.C. 
I will not be ungrateful if you can urgently furnish
me with your full name as you want it to appear in the
necessary documents, address, private telephone, fax
and mobile numbers so as to enable us conclude all
modalities associated with the transfer of the funds
for onward transmission into your nominated bank
account because the Central Bank of Nigeria has
authorized the Guaranty Credit Bank of Nigeria to
make payments to all contractors and you will be
included among the contractors by me and my
colleagues.  
Looking forward to hear from you soonest so as to stop
further contacts .

Dr. Frank Bello.

Bond certificates and the passwords to the vaults, i
am not about to tell you the password and how many
bonds involved until I have your words right now I am
on the run, Than is why I dont want to go back there
from UK and where it got bad is that I bear the same
name with my late father my mother Mrs. Mary Ezekiel
and younger sister is here with me in the UK and said
that I should find someone who will help me convert
the gold bonds into cash or move the bonds away from
Abidjan to Europe or America where it could still be
converted to cash.

Now the war in my country is over with the help of
ECOMOG soldiers, the present government of Sierra
Leone has revoked the passport of all officers who
served under the former regime and now ask countries
to expel such person at the same time freeze their
account and confiscate their asset, it is on this note
that I am contacting you, all I need from you is your
Trust.

I am offering you 20 % of the total bonds, now
all my hope is banked on your trust and I really wants
to invest this money a country, were their is
stability of Government, political and economic
welfare. 

Dont be alarmed how I contacted you. I was giving this
information by an activist from my country.

Thanks and God bless
Best regards 
Isaac Ezekiel Jnr

Dr.Kunle Owolo.
Tel:234-8042136866
Fax:234- 1-7597626
Block 4 Federal Secretariat Road,
Ikoyi-Lagos


REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Dr.Kunle Owolo, the chairman of contract award and review committee set
up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts
executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of
these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of
USD$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state Dollars).

This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that
the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid
and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I
are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent
disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of
conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign
accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10%
shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit
the balance
to other accounts in due course.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of
finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the
funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above
stated terms.

our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transaction
the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole
approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name
or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary.
Once more I want you to understand that
having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I
am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore
be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.

Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a fax
on my confidential fax number ( 234 17 597626) or mail to private email
address,so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that this
business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly.

I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal
strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we
intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute
the second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.

Thanks and God bless,

Dr.Kunle Owolo.

Dear Friend
 
My name is MRS.ROHDA SAEED IBRAHIM from Iraq. I am married to DR. SAEED IBRAHIM, who worked with shell Petroleum Company in Iraq for twelve years before he died after a brief illness. 
We were married for eight years without a child. Since we married we were both Islamic couple members. After his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $9.5 Million (Nine million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with International Diplomatic service firm in London with purpose to invest the fund in Islamic foundation or better Christian foundation before his death, The fund is still under safe keeping with the International Diplomatic firm in London, hence and contacting you to help me to achieve this project in your country.
 
 During the current war in my country, all the property and the assets of my husband were destroyed I don�t have anything left on behalf of my husband except this fund that�s deposited with the Diplomatic service company in London, now I�m undergoing a serious illness that resulted to be stroke and cancer problem, I had tried all my best to treat myself with every medical expert but there is no improvement, Currently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next six  months due to my cancer problems. Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to Mosque, Islamic School Authority or Better Christian foundation, individual, that will utilize this money the way I instruct here.
 
I want this fund to be distributed to, Orphanages, Widows promoting the work of almighty Allah, and to promote work of Almighty Allah in your country. The Koran made us to understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision because I don�t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband�s brothers are unbelievers.
 
If this fund spent to promote the work of Almighty Allah, better. I don�t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the heaven. I don�t need any telephone communication in this regard because my health and the presence of my husband relatives around me always,
I don�t want them to know about this development. With Allah all things are possible. 
 
As soon as I receive your reply I will instruct the DIPLOMATIC operation manager and my husband lawyer to furnish you with more details on how to receive the fund.
I will also instruct him to issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original-beneficiary of this fund. I want Christians and the Muslims to always pray for me because in Almighty Allah I put my hope. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Muslim.
 
Reply me through my alternative e-mail address, as you delay in your reply will give room in sourcing for another faith member for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I instructed here. As, I am seriously ill and I will not be able to move around and do much due to the illness, I will really appreciate it, if you only contact me through my Email:Address:rohda3_saeedibrahim@yahoo.co.uk 
as the Internet is my only means of communicating. Hope to hearing from you soonest.
 
Remain blessed in the name of the Allah.

Mr.G.Boka <gb1965@walla.com>,si.all@UM,"Sun, 27 Mar 2005 04:33:30 +0900",Waiting for response Pls !!!,"Dear Blessed One,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me,
because, I believe everyone will die someday.
My name is George Boka ,a merchant in South Africa and 
Zimbabwe.  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,according to medical experts.
 
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never
really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business.
Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was always
hostile to people and only focused on my business as that
was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this
as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting
to have or make all the money in the world.
 
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this
world I would live my life a different way from how I have
lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and
given most of my property and assets to my immediate and
extended family members as well as a few close friends. 

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So
far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations
in the U.A.E, Algeria,Malaysia and some countries in
Africa. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I
cannot do this myself anymore.
 
I once asked members of my family to close one of my
accounts and distribute the money which I have there to
charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused
and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust
them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I
have left for them.
 
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash
deposit of One Million United States Dollars
US$1,000,000,00 that I have with a Security Company
abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and
dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 10% for you,your time and also any
expenses incured during this Great task.
God be with you.

ATTENTION: DEAR  SIR



              HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

  With due respect trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which I believe it will be a great interst
to you.I found your contact while I was doing a
private research on the internet for a reliable and
capable foreign partner that will assist my family and
me. That's why I contacted you. I am MRS.ROSE SONDO
the wife of MR.MICHAEL SONDO of Zimbabwe.
  During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and
from the support of our president ROBERT MUGABE to
claim all the white owned farms in our country, all
the white and black farmers were ordered to surrender
their farms to his party members and his followers. My
husband who was one of the best farmers in our country
and treasurer of the farmer's CO-pperation did not
suport his idea and so the party members invaded my
husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm,
Killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in
my husband's farm.
    After the death of my husband, i and my childern
decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were
in danger with the money that my husband kept in his
hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the
safe is US$24.2M (TWENTY FOUR.TWO MILLION UNITED SATES
DOLLAR) and we decided to code the money and move to
the Republic of SOUTH AFRICA where we deposited the
money in a SECURITY COMPANY as a valuable item.So i
decided to make contact with an overseas firm whom
will assist me to move this money out of South Africa,
because we are asylum seekers here in South Africa.
   So if you consider this proppsal, we have agreed to
give you 30% of the total sum for helping us to move
this money out to your country and 10% will be mapped
out for expenses both of us may incur during this
transaction and 60% Will be for me and family to
invest in your country. All i want is for you to
furnish me with all your banking details and your
personal phone and fax numbers for easy communication.
You can contact me on the above Tel and e-mail
address.
  NOTE: That this transaction is 100% risk free and
absolutely confidential.Then if you are intrested to
help me and children you will contact my only son
MAGIZAR SONDO with the above e-mail

Address : Rue 152 Cocody Abidjan
Cote D' Ivoire West Africa.

Dearest One,

I wish to solicit your help in migrating to you. My name is Nena Donald. I am the only daugther of Late General Frank Donald the former Director of military inteligence and special acting General Manager of the Sieria Leone Diamond mining coperation(SLDMC ).

I am contacting you to seek your good assistance to transfer and invest (USD 10. million) belonging to my late father which is deposited in a bank in Abidjan. This money is revenues from solid minirals and dimonds sale which were under my fathers possession before the civil war broke out.

Following the brake out of the war, almost all government offices, coperations and parastatals were attacked and vandalized. 

The SLDMC was loothed and burnt down to ashes, and diamonds worth millions of dollars was stolen by the rebel military forces who attacked my fathers office. Many top government officials and senior army officers were assasinated and my father was a key target because of his very sensitive military possition and appointment in the SLDMC. 

Regreatably, my father was captured and murdered along with half brother in cool blood during a mid-night rebel shoot-out when our official residence in freetown was armbushed by Fordey Sanko the notorious rebel leader.

My mother sustainded very sever bullet injuries which resulted to her untimelyand painful death in a private hospital here in Ivory Coast. Now I am alone in a totally strange country without parents, relatives or any body to care for me at my tender ages. 

Before my mother died, she told me that my father deposited some money which he made from diamond sales and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and that i should pray and find a trustworthy foreign business partner who would help me to transfer and invest this money in profitable business venture overseas.

She told me to do this quickly so that i can leave Ivory Coast with my cousin brother-Arthur who is here in the camp with me and, then settle down abroad. 

She gave to me all the bank documents to prove the deposit and then told me that my father used my name as the only daugther to deposit the money in the bank. She told me that this is the reason why we came to Ivory Coast. My mother died afterwards. May her soul rest in perfect peace. 

I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this money and I spoke with the director of International remittance who assured me that the everything is intact and promised to help me transfer this money to my foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide my partners foreign bank account for them.

However, the director is very concerned because of my age, I am 23 years and as such promised to help me and he would like to speak with my partner to ensure that this money is invested wisely in only profitable business because of his personal interest and sympathy for me. 

If you are will to assist me, please let me know immediately and provide me with your following information for bank here:

1. Your full names and address, tel/ fax
2. Name of Bank and addres, Tel/fax/telex
3. Account name and number and
4. swift code etc.

Please note that I can only offer you 10% of the total money as compensation for your noble assistance in accodiance with my mothers advise. I am interested in any profitable commercial venture which you consider very good in your country and you would also get a school for me and cousin so that we can finish our colledge education. 

I am hoping to hear your urgent response so that I can not look for another foreign partner.

Thank you and may God bless you and your dear family.

Yours sincerely
Nena Donald.

Good 
Day,

Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet 
your business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr. 
Barry Henry, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known 
bank, here in London, England.

One of our accounts, with holding 
balance of £15,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has been 
dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and 
confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John 
Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in 
Birmingham; you can view this CNN website

http://edition.cnn.
com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/

for details on the crash.

Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this 
money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the 
existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from 
the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into 
the UK.

I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank 
officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal 
with. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the 
next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you 
after necessary processes have been followed.

This transaction is 
totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does 
not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal 
act.

On your interest, let me hear from you.

Warm Regards,

Mr. Barry

FROM THE DESK OF
MR JERRY OZUBA 
N N P C.
 
MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

I am Jerry.Ozuba,the chief accountant of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.
There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of
multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:
1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).
2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.
3. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.
The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.
It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.
Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total  amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at this junction is
enormous. 
In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and
external) between the parties in the course of the transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,the Nigerian  officials.
Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the
above stated terms.
Our assurance is that your role is risk free,I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund,the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.
Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.
Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have my image and career deemed.
Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you are  interested in this deal or not, if you are not, it will enable us scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where you are interested send the required documents.

Send by Email for security reasons with this email address jerry_640@fsmail.net

Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest co-operation.
Very truly yours,
JERRY.OZUBA.

Mohammed Abacha <orionventures@go.com>,opetuy2k@yahoo.com,"Fri, 09 May 2003 05:02:44 -0700",Business Cooperation,"From:Muhammed Abacha

I wish to introduce myself to you and the reason for my reaching out to you. I am Muhammed Abacha the the son of the late military head of state General Sani Abacha who died mysteriously on the 8th of June 1998. Following the death of my father Gen. Sani Abacha,elections were successfully held in the country and a civilian administration was sworn into power with the assistance of the American Government under the leadership of President Clinton. With the advent of the new democratic administration, a decision was taken by the new president
of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo to probe and ultimately prosecute all past military officers and their cohorts that served in very strategic capacities in the last military regime of my father.I was among those singled out to to be punished after a makeshift trial,for the supposed deeds of my dad,ever since I have been in detention(the past 3 years).

On monday the 24 September 2002,I was released,on the condition that I will release the rest of my fathers money in my care,to the tune of $I.5b,which I agreed. Now I have been released but kept under severe house arrest,I had amassed monies running into hundreds of millions of dollars stashed in various private foreign accounts around the world,most of wish have been frozen. Presently, I am confined under house arrest after my recent release from detention and I am now constrained into seeking for this assistance today because I cannot afford to let this goverment know that I still have funds stashed away. Shortly, before my detention I hurriedly deposited the sum of USD35.5 m illion with a security deposit firm for safekeeping,hence my seeking your assistance to receive this fund. I have since had
this amount stashed away in a private security company in Europe. I cannot send this money to any of my Bank Account abroad or open a new account for reasons mentioned earlier.

I hereby seek your assistance in moving and securing this money in your account abroad. I will adequately compensate you with 15% of the total sum for your assistance and co-operation with me to move this fund to your account for safe keeping where I can easily utilise it. The present administration has beamed their search light on any body remotely related to me and my family and you strongly know for certain that I am under surveillance and I cannot operate any of my bank accounts any more, due to their being frozen. I intend to safeguard and invest this amount of money abroad, but with a reliable foreign business partner so that we can invest the funds in doing business in your country. 

That is why I am soliciting your assistance and cooperation as regards this business.Arrangements are being concluded with the Security Company which has branches in Europe to receive the money in cash. I cannot tell the full story of my predicament on this letter. However you can get more information by checking the following web;

Mr.Harry Hakeem <harryhakeem1956@netscape.net>,rrrrr <R@M>,"Fri, 09 Jul 2004 13:23:39 -0400",CHARITY SUPPORT,"Dear Friend.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.
My name is MR.HARRY HAKEEM, a merchant in Dubai, in the
U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few
months to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only
focused on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come
to this world I would live my life a different way
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called
me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family
members as well as a few close friends.
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul
so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one
of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them.
The last of my money which no one knows of is the
huge cash deposit of TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS
$12,000,000,that I have with a finance/Security Company
abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit
and dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 25% for you and for your time if you want to help me to collect this Funds and also invest this money.

N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE
LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE
DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY
UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR
SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME.

I apollogize in advance if this mail comes as an embarrassment because of so many things that happens in our times. I am Isaac Baka, the site inspection director with the ministry ofworks and construction and I worked directly with the Minister in charge of the Ministry here in Republic of Sudan.
   
I awarded a contract to a firm worth several millions of dollars a few years ago. In the course of executing the project the firm discovered large gold deposit in one of the construction sites. Being the site director I collaborated with the firm in the mining of the gold on a mutual agreement to share the proceeds out of which I got a share of 7.5 Million. 

As a civil servant in this small war torn country, I cannot introduce this funds into the banking system here considering my meager monthly income as well as the code of conduct guidelines regulating civil service here in my country, Sudan. Presently Sudan is engulfed in a civil crisis and as this crisis intensified by the day, I have decided to move this fund out for any profitable venture. The fund will be moved out of Sudan under diplomatic cover as soon as we conclude all procedure.

I therefore solicit for your co-operation to take delivery of this fund into your custody for any profitable investment that will be mutually beneficial. I will be able to arrange all necessary procedures to ensure smooth movement of this funds until you are in control of it.  

Please let me know if you are interested by return mail to be sent to: (isbaka@myway.com, isbaka@sify.com). Also include your full names and contact telephone number to enable me call you. I will provide you with more information as soon as you indicate appreciable interest to deal.

Zuma Koffi <kofi_z06@yahoo.com>,sigmod-pods06-webmaster@UM,"Wed, 15 Mar 2006 07:18:21 -0800",Matter m  of trust,"Dear Sir/Madam
Compliment of the day to you .
I got your contact through business search from the internet.
I am Mr.Kofi Zuma, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch
. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th
2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek
made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at
TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my
branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply.
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next
of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.
This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. 
No one will come forward to claim it.
According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,
the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies
to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to
assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael
creek,
so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the
hands of some corrupt officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full
names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall
employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration
in your favor for the transfer.
A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%
for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous
expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary
paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding.
Best Regards.

BANGKOK THAILAND
DEAR SIR, 

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am RAYMOUND kABE, the first son of DR KINGSLEY SMITH KABE who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through network online hence decided to
write you. 

Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$10.5Million(Ten million five hundred thousand United StatesDollars), in one the private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.This money was deposited in a box as germ stones to avoid much demurrage from Security Company.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and established of new farm in Swaziland. 

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduce a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks farmers.And this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victim. 
It is against this background that, I and my family who are currently staying in bangkok thailand decided to transfer my father�s money to foreign account sine c the law of bangkok prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the teritorial zone bangkok. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddle with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are Sent on taking everything we have got. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in bangkok for fear of what is going on in the bangkok Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment for an asylum seeker. 

As a businessman, who I have to entrust my future and of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me is to make arrangements and come to bangkok thailand, sothat you can open a non-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. 

I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the options you want, feel free to notify me I have also mapped out 10% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 70% will be for my investment in your country. 
Contact me with the above E-mail and please candly put ur numberin your reply. while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. 

Yours Faithfully, 

RAY KABE

idris umar <idrisumar94@go.com>,idrisumar94@go.com,"Tue, 08 Jul 2003 18:52:12 -0700",Thank You.,"Attn: The President /ceo 

Dear, 

By way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. 

Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. 

Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . 

By this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to 
understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. 

Trusting to hear from you, I remain 

Respectfully yours, 

Mr. Idris Umar.

 I know this letter will come to you as surprise. I
managed to get your contact line from the Cote Divoire
Chamber of Commerce, hence I did not waste time to
contact you on a business proposal. 

Firstly, I deem is important to introduce myself. I am
MRS SARA KABILA the third WIFE of late Democratic
Republic of Congo President Luarent Kabila, who was
assassinated on Tuesday 16th Jan . 2001, by his
bodyguard. After the death of my husband, I and my son
williams Kabila were not well treated in the family.
His first wife(Madam Maman Kabila and her son(Joseph
Kabila)who succeeds my late husband as the next
President of Democratic Republic of Congo dominated my
entire husband assets and property.

 Fortunately for me, on the day of the incident, I was
in my husband&#146;s private house at LUMUBASHI, Firstly I
wept over his assassination and then I thought of my
future. I then started searching for important
documents and valuables, because I know that my
husband used to exchange minerals to buy arms from
foreign companies. Eventualy I ran into one of these
important documents. As God has planned for me, it
happened that my husband deposited a Diplomatic Box in
my name with a security and Finance Company in Abidjan
Cote Divoire. I could not believe when I picked up the
document
Referred to here as the &#147;DEED OF LODGE&#148; My late
husband secured (US$12million) TWELVE MILLION UNITED
STATE DOLLARS, which was acquired from the sales of
minerals. On discovering this document I came to
Abidjan Cote Divoire where I am presently residing 
with my only son williams. 

Right now I want you to assist me to transfer this
money into your account in your country, where I will
invest it in any lucrative business as you may advice
me. For your assistance I will offer you 25% of the
total amount and 10% will be set aside for expenses we
may incure in the process of this transaction. Should
this letter receive your honor please do not hesitate
to contact me or my son, and try to maintain the
confidentialty of this transaction. 
I'm waiting anxiously to hear your favourable reply.

NB: Please furnish me with your private number for
easy communication. Please note that this
 Transaction is 100% risk free and you should up hold
the secrecy involved. 
 
Best regards,

I am MR. MARTINS AKUthe eastern district bank manager of united bank for Africa plc (UBA). There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After intensive investigations, I discovered that if I do not find a way to get the amount in question stacked out somewhere safe urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account, ENGR. SMITH U. WILLIAMS, a foreigner, the manager of Petro- technical support services, a chemical Engineer by profession and he died in 1990 and no other person knows about this account or any other beneficiary. My investigations prove to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and has no attachment to the said amount. The amount involved is 56 MILLION USD (FIFTY-SIX MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) ONLY. 

In the light of the fact, I needed your assistance to open your door to this opportunity by providing your account or any account of your choice where the fund will be remitted. I want to transfer this money into a safe foreigners account abroad but I dont know any one who could actually assist, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to a foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the owner of the account ENGR. SMITH U. WILLIAMS and a foreigner too. 

I know that this mail will come as surprise to you as we dont know ourselves, but be sure that is for real. I got your contact on the believing that you will not let me down in this business. You are the only person that I have contacted for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will let you know what steps to take next. Send also your private telephone, fax and mobile number for easy communication including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account. I need your full co-operation to make this work out alright. 

Your assistance as foreigner is necessary because the management is ready to welcome any person, a foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you immediately, if you are interested to conclude this transaction with me. If your are capable of handling such amount in strict confidence, keeping to my instructions I need a sincere person for this venture because I dont want to make mistake, I need your strong assurance that this money will be intact pending my arrival in your country for sharing. 

You should be informed strictly that I will burn all the documents in your presence immediately after this money has been remitted to your account leaving no trace to any place. 

I will apply for annual leave immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. This is to enable me use my position and influence to effect legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange department. 

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 20% of the total amount, 70% will be for us and 10%for any expenses incurred during the transaction.

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you dont know me personally, I am DR RANI ALI JUMA, the first son of DR. OMAR ALI JUMA, and he was the VICE PRESIDENT of the REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA. Before he died, my father died at the age of 63 in the year 2001 after addressing fellow TANZANIANS during the visit of PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA of DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO and YUERI MUSEVENI of UGANDA. I got your contact through the Ghana information Exchange (G.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person  to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you.
My late father was among the ruling party (CCM) which the opposition party was dominated by his Muslim brothers led by PROF. IBRAHIM LIPUMBA. Before his death he had taken to Europe  to deposit the sum of US$40 million (FORTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security and finance company as if he foresaw the looming danger coming. The money was deposited in two sealed boxes as valuables goods to avoid much demurrage from the security company. I most say that the death of my father has warned me and my whole family not to go back to politics. For the fact that PRESIDENT BENJAMIN MKAPA, never showed any concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life was no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana ,West Africa where I am residing now with my own family.
Meanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I dont think of going back and for this I and my family have decided to transfer my fathers money into a foreign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who have tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of African government. Furthermore, the new Ghana government does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must entrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.
Therefore, if you accept to assist me and my family, we are willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 75% for me and my family, while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial property based on your advice and I will also wish to receive your genuine assurance that you would not sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your personal or companys account. If this transaction is acceptable by you.
BEST REGARDS

I greet you in the name of our lord. My name is MRS ROSELINE MULEKO, I
am a
widow and a mother of Two all girls. I know you will see my letter to
you as
an embarrassment considering the fact that we do not know ourselves,
from
Adam, but,plead with you to be patient with me. Well,I feel very
pleased to
contact you for some assistance and business relationship.

I live in South Africa with my children. My late husband was a loving,
caring and hardworking businessman who died unfortunately In a ghastly
autocrash.

Before the sudden death of my beloved husband, and father of my
daughters,
my late husband intended to establish a business, Abroad with the sum
of$8.5
million united states dollars, but unfortunately he died before this
proposed venture.

Following his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled
to
his property (Assets and money) since I am a woman and my offspring's
all
girls as I do not have a male child for my husband. Well, according to
barbaric traditional laws here in this partof Africa which doesn't
entitled
a woman to inherit a man's property, as they are expected by tradition
to
take over the management of his business and other properties including
myself who automatically becomes a wife to one of his immediate
brothers.

Unfortunately to this wicked family members, the $8.5million united
states
dollars which my late husband intended to use in establishing a
business in
Overseas was deposited in a bank account unknown to his family.I and

TEL:234-8034540228
Dear Sir,/Madam
I am LADY SWEETIE AMINA USMAN, Bank Manager of Zenith
International Bank of Nigeria,Adeola Odeku Branch,Lagos . I have urgent and
 very
confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American Oil 
consultant/contractor
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a
numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at
US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon
maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got
no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his
official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This
sum of US$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foriegner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the
fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some
corrupt government officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately
your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next
of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and
letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.
We would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of
kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mr. Barry Kelly to travel and
claim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe or sub-regional
African country which is used by my bank as an offshore clearing house
to the bank.The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio
of 60% for me and 40% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch
Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via
the private email address below. Upon your response,I shall then provide
you with more details and relevant documents that will help you
understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I
shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please
furnish me with your telephone and fax numbers for easier and faster
communication. Awaiting your urgent reply via my 
email:ami44000@netzero.net
Thanks and regards,
SWEETIE AMINA USMAN

              Dear friend,
                       
                   RE: TRANSFER OF US$28.5MILLION.

Compliments Of The 
Day, Permit me to introduce myself
to you. 
      
My name is MR.
JOHNSON GUBE,a top Management Official
of the above Finance Corporation 
in Cotonou, Benin
Republic.

I came to know about you in my private 
search for a
reliable person/company to handle an important
assingment 
on behalf of my Colleagues and myself.

MY PROPOSITION: An Australian 
Engr Donald Pepper, a
prosperous oil & Gold merchant had in our Bank 
the sum
of $28.5million in a domiciliary account.
Unfortunately, he was 
killed in a ghastly motor
accident in Benin Republic. Efforts had been 
made by
the management of my bank through the Australian
Embassy to 
contact any of the deceased children but to
no avail.

We later 
discovered that he had no children.Given the
skeletal information 
available to the bank,it has so
far been impossible to reach any of the 
relatives. The
situation left for the Management is to declare the
deceased account dormant and revert the funds to
trading for interest 
to the Bank. In order to avoid
this development, my Colleagues and I 
now seek your
approval to have you stand as a distant relative to
Engr 
Donald Pepper,so that the money would be released
to you.

All 
documents and proofs to enable you get the money
will be carefully 
packaged once we receive your
interest in this proposal.I shall apply 
for a leave as
soon as the funds get into your reliable account to
come 
to your country for sharing and investments which
you will assist me in 
doing.

May I assure you that this is safe and risk-free, as
we have 
taken care of all necessary modalities to
ensure a hitch-free movement. 
I have the authority of
my partners involved in this assignment to 
propose
that should you be willing to assist us in this,your
share 
would be 30%.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint me. Call me immediately to show
that you have 
recieved this mail and I will brief you
more on the successful transfer 
process.

Best Regards,

MR.JOHNSON GUBE.

Dr. Tunde Cole. 
Block 4 Federal Secretariat Complex, 
#16 Norman Williams Way. 
Ikoyi-Lagos 

ATTENTION: 

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 

I am Dr. Tunde Cole the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. 

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of USD$31,500,000.00 (thirty one million five hundred thousand united state Dollars). 

This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, 
the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transaction the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having 
my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by responding to this email so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year. 

Thanks and God bless. 

Dr.Tunde Cole.

Contracts Award Monitoring Committee.
Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources.
0031 617 664 901
ATTN:,
I humbly wish to solicit for your assistance in a business transaction.
This business proposal I wish to intimate you of will be of mutual benefit
to the both of us and its success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a
high level of confidentiality.

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committee of
the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking your assistance
to enable me transfer the sum of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account.
The fund came up as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on
behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two
foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty
Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the
contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of
US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This
contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian
firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is
in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.

As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law
to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to
you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company
account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the
Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of
US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) into your provided account.

On actualization, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.
1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary
2. 80% of the fund will be for us.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth
actualization of the transaction within the next few working days of
commencement. For further details as to the workability of this
transaction,
please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification.
Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.
Yours Sincerely,

I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, from Kuwait. I am married to 
Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed 
memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine 
years before he died in the year 
2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died 
after a brief illness that lasted 
only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and 
I was a devoted Christian by 
birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my 
late husband was alive, he 
deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million, 
five hundred dollars), which he in
herited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an 
overseas finance and security firm. 
Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. 
Recently, my doctor told me that I 
had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next 
four months. 

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either 
a Christian organization or a 
devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way 
I am going to instruct here in.
  

I want this Christian organization or individual to use this 
money in all sincerity to fund 
churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the society 
upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible 
emphasized so much on the giving 
of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold 
step. I took this decision 
because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives 
are all Muslims and I don't want 
my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call 
me an unbeliever.

I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an 
unholy manner hence the reasons for 
taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with 
God the highest and the most 
merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will 
only give you the contact of my 
lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making 
you the beneficiary of the 
consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this 
letter and accept to assist me 
to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he 
will arrange for that because my 
doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I 
can't discuss in the presence of
my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the 
hospital, my lawyer is the only person 
that knows the decision that I am taking.

With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I 
receive your reply through my 
lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the 
beneficiary of the consignment and all 
necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall 
also give you the contact of the
finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of 
authority that will prove you as the 
original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian 
community where you reside to 
always pray for me. 

My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian 
though married to a Muslim, 
whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in 
spirit, please always be prayerful 
all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room 
in souring for another Christian
organization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. 

Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your 
shoulders, may the Almighty God 
continue to guide and protect you. Amen. 

Yours faithfully, 

PLEASE REPLY THROUGH MY ATTORNEYS PRIVATE EMAIL:kufor100@yahoo.com

Micheal Bangura <mbangura@walla.com>,,"Thu, 10 Feb 2005 15:38:57 +0100",Hello From Micheal !!!!! .,"Dear 

Good day!!. 

Compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family!!!. 

I know this letter will come to you surprisingly but let it not be a surprise to you, for nature has a way of arriving unannouced and an adage says 'originals are very hard to find but their echo sounds louder'. So, I decided to contact you myself for you to assure me of safety and honesty if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody. 

I am Mr Micheal Bangura, the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura who was the minister of finance in Sierra leone but was killed during the civil war. Knowing your country as being economical condusive for investment and your people as transperant and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise I write you. 

Before my father death, he had the sum of twenty-three million united states dollars(us$23,000,000.00) which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war and deposited it in a security company for saftey and safe-keeping. this fund was supposed to be used for rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country before the outbreak of war. when the war broke out, the rebel leader demanded that this fund be given to him, my father insisted that the money was not in his possesion but he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund. 

Meanwhile my mother and i is the only person who knows about this fund,because my father always confide in me since i am the only child in the family.When my father was killed,I quickly made an arrangemnt with a red cross rellief worker who used his official van to move me and my mother to lungi airport in freetownfor our safety because the rebels also wanted to kill us too. 

The fund was deposited by my late father as a family inheritance with a safe relaible security company in Dakar senegel where I was only given temporary asylum with my mother.I do not want to invest this money in senegel due to unfavourable economic climate and so close to my country. Also, I still kept this money also for security reasons as the present administration is investigating the existence of such fund of which I denied knowledge of it, claiming that my father did not tell me about such money. The only assistance I need from you which i believe you would do for me are the following: 

1.Assist me invest this money in your country when it is release to you on our behalf by the security company. 

2.Assure me that you will not sit on my share when this fund gets to your country. 

You will have 15% of the money for yourself as you guide me further to invest the remaining 80% in any valueble business venture while 5% is earmarked to cover expenses contingencies. 

Most importantly, i will like to buy a personal house where i and my mother will reside.Upon confirmation of your interest to help me as my foreign partner to invest this money, i will link you the details of this 

transaction to be scheduled in your favo ur by the security company. 

While thanking you for your anticipated understanding and cooperation, I look forward to your urgent response. 

please note that this transaction is strictly confidential and must be treated with utmost secrecy. 

Best regards, 

Mr. Micheal Bangura.

I am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with !
 a very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;
(i) As government employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the 
foreign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the 
whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is 
first to furnish us with the following through my email address.
1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )
2.) The beneficiary's name,
3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a 
smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria 
Government Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you,reply me 
immediately through my personal E-mail: uzoromaobi@o2.pl or call me on my

Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE
CHILDREN OF GOD.

My name is Mother Doris Killam 63years old woman from United States of
America. I am married to Engineer Pitt Killam who till his death Worked
with Willbros, a U.S oil Engineering firm here in Nigeria, we were
married for Thirteen (13) years without a child.

He died on Saturday, 18 February 2006 after my late husband Eng. Pitt
and Eight (8) other foreign oil workers were abducted by militia groups
active in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria, on the process of
negotiation by the Nigerian Government and the Militant Group
unfortunately, my
husband Eng. Pitt Killam died, before his death, we deposit a sum of
$2.5 Million Dollars which was proceed of a contract work he just
concluded with the Nigerian Ports authority.

PLEASE FIND FACT ON THE INFORMATION FROM THE WEBSITE BELOW.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4726680.stm

After his painful death I decided not to re-marry or get a child
outside my matrimonial home. My Doctor told me that I would not last
for the
next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most
is my partial stroke as a result of high blood pressure.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this funds to church or
better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the
way
I am going to instruct herein. I want a church or individual that will
use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the
word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that grivet. I
took this decision because I dont have any child that will
inherit
this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I
dont
want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I
dont want a situation where this money will be used in an
ungodly
manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision.

I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I
am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the
lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things
are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I will want you to give
me
your

Name:...........................

Occupation:.....................

I will send a copy to the bank. For identification when you will
contact them. I want you and the church to always pray for me because
the
lord is my shepherd and I shall not want.

My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Please
assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.

Note: this must be kept confidentially from eyes and ears of my
husband's family. Hoping to hear from you.

Reply me and Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

yaya <dr_tyh@hotmail.com>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Wed, 21 Jul 2004 10:26:16 +0100",IN GOD WE TRUST,"Dearest,

I am Chief Thomas Nimely yaya, chairman of the Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia (MODEL),now Foreign Minister in the transitional 
government, and also a first cousin to the deposed President 
of Liberia, Charles Taylor, who is presently in exile in one of the 
West African Countries.

 During the reign of my cousin, Charles Taylor, I was
in-charge of all Diamond operations coming from
Angola, Sierra Leone, etc.  Then Charles Taylor enjoyed
the patronage of the rebels controlling parts of 
these countries, as tonnes of uncut diamond were
shipped to him, and he inturn through me sold these
diamonds to foreigners, and used the proceeds to buy
arms for the rebels in these countries, and a large
chunk of this money  was for the enrichment of the
rebel leaders. Literally speaking he  gave cover to the
rebel Leaders. This operation was code named: Conflict
Diamond. I cordinated the entire Diamond trade in the
sub-region and this ran into hundreds of Million of
Dollar.

While carrying out this operation, I was able to divert
the sum of US$45,000,000.00 (Forty-Five Million
United States Dollars) for my personal benefit, and
it is concelled into 4 Trunk Boxes and deposited as
artifacts materials with ecowas diplomatic Security and cargo unit 
 in Accra-Ghana. 

The Security Company does not know the
true contents of the consignments. This is only known to you and 
me, and I hope you will keep this confidential.

Now that Charles Taylor is no more in Power, I thought
it wise to move the money out to any  country of the
world for investment purposes. Now I am contacting you
seeking your assistance to help me in transfering this
money to your country. All you need do is to make
necesary arrangement and fly down to Accra-Ghana, see the
money and talk about it.

Already, I have the consent of the Security Company Director in Accra-Ghana
who has agreed to help us move the consignments out through
Diplomatic means to their affilliate office in Europe. 

I am offering you 25% of the total amount involved for
assisting me while 5% is set aside for any expenses that might be incurred during
the completion of this project, and the remaining 70% will be used for any lucrative
investment you will introduce me into.



Best Regards,

Chief Thomas Nimely yaya.

            panmentat@phantomemail.com
            
KINDEST ATTENTION,

PLEASE PERMIT ME TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE IN SO INFORMAL A MANNER.
THIS IS NECESSITATED BY MY URGENT NEED TO REACH A DEPENDABLE AND
TRUSTWORTHY FOREIGN PARTNER. THIS REQUEST MAY SEEM STRANGE AND
UNSOLICITED BUT I CRAVE YOUR INDULGENCE AND PRAY THAT YOU TAKE MY
REQUEST VERY SERIOUS.

I AM MR PETER WILLIAMS, A REKNOWNED BUSINESSMAN IN ONE OF THE
REBEL-HELD TOWNS, BOUAKE (ONE OF THE WAR ZONES IN IVORY COAST)
I RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO DESCRIBED YOUR
COUNTRY AS BEING ECONOMICALLY CONDUCIVE FOR INVESTMENT
AND HER PEOPLE AS TRANSPARENT AND TRUSTWORTHY TO ENGAGING BUSINESS
WHICH MADE ME TO WRITE YOU. AS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW
AND TO MAKE YOU LESS CURIOUS,I GOT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS FROM AN
INTERNET SITE THAT PORTRAYED YOU (YOUR ESTABLISHMENT) IN GOOD
LIGHT.

ON THE 17TH OF SEPTEMBER 2002. THE REBEL LEADERS, UNTIL THEN WERE
LOYAL SOLDIERS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT LAURENT GBAGBO 
CONTACTED ME IN MY OFFICE WITH THE BUSINESS OF IMPORTATION OF
ARMOURIES. WITHOUT THE PREMONITION OF WAR, I ACCEPTED THE JOB. THE
SOLDIERS PAID ME THE SUM OF TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$ 20.5) ON THE SPOT AND TOLD ME TO EXPEDITE
ACTION. SINCE I AM NOT INTO IMPORTATION OF ARMUNITIONS AND BECAUSE OF
THE URGENCY, I IMMEDIATELY STARTED MAKING SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH
BUSINESSMEN ACROSS THE GLOBE.

TWO DAYS LATER, HEAVY FIGHTING BROKE UP IN CENTRAL BAOUKE AND
KORHOGO, EVERYWHERE WAS IN DISSARRAY AND I LOST EVERYTHING THAT TOOK
ME SO MANY YEARS TO ACQUIRE. I HAVE NO OPTION THAN TO DO AWAY WITH
THE US$20.5M.


MY WIFE AND I QUICKLY MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A RED CROSS RELIEF
WORKER WHO USED HIS OFFICIAL VAN TO MOVE THIS MONEY TO ABIDJAN,
ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE REAL CONTENT OF THE BOX.  PRESENTLY,
THIS FUND HAS BEEN DEPOSITED WITH A SAFE RELIABLE SECURITY COMPANY IN
ABIDJAN WHERE I AM HIDING FROM THE REBEL WHO DECLEARED ME WANTED. I
DO NOT WANT TO INVEST THIS MONEY IN ABIDJAN DUE TO UNFAVORABLE
ECONOMIC CLIMATE.  AS A RESULT, I KEPT THE MONEY IN A CUSTOM BONDED
WAREHOUSE WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY.  SO THAT I CAN NOT LAY MY HANDS
ON IT UNTIL
IT GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY, WHERE I WILL COMMENCE INVESTMENT.

THE ONLY ASSISTANCE WE NEED FROM YOU WHICH I BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO FOR US ARE THE FOLLOWING:

1. MAKE IMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENT TO TAKE THE DELIVERY OF
THE CRATE (FUND) AT THEIR EUROPE OR AMERICAN
COMMISSION AGENTS.
2. ASSURANCE FROM YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT SIT ON OUR
SHARE WHEN THIS FUND GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY.

MY WIFE AND I AGREED THAT YOU SHALL BE ENTITLED TO 20% OF THE TOTAL
AMOUNT WHILE THE PRINCIPAL SUM WILL BE INVESTED IN A VIABLE BUSINESS
VENTURE WITH YOUR ADVICE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WILL LIKE TO BUY A
PERSONAL HOUSE WHERE MY WIFE, MY TWO SONS AND I WILL RESIDE.

UPON CONFIRMATION OF YOUR INTEREST TO HELP US AS OUR FOREIGN PARTNER

Kabila of Democratic Republic of  Congo (DRC).  Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am  in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million  US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for  special projects.  This fund has since been deposited  in a security company in West African Country of Togo  where I am residing now with my children. It is now my intention to move the said fund out of  this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of  my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on  this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me  take this money out of Togo.  However, note that my children and I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the  offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your  responsibility in directing us on a viable business.  It is also my intention to relocate and probably take  a temporarily resident in your country pending when  all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We  advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon  as we arrived.  To conclude this transaction, you will be required to  come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in  Togo where the security company will deposit the total  sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be  remitted into your original bank in your country.  Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to  your country, where my children and I are expected to  take a temporary resident.  Please note that I can not open any Bank account with  my name because, My late husband's first  son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't  want to see me and my children, He claimed that when  our husband was alive, that I was very close to him  than any other of his wives including his (Joseph)  mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness  to him that I was able to get things from him more  than others. As a result he has been monitoring me.

Dear Sir,

       It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet. 
My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.

My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.
Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.
It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.
This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE
 and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.
And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.
Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.
So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  
I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.
Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project. 

Best regards,

Mrs.Atiya Mohameed

I hope this mail meets you in good health and spirit; i am, Rawlings Ometie, a sierra Leonie. Presently, I live as a refugee in republic of Ireland, with my younger sister, Sarah. I am the son of late Chief Dr. Wilfred Ometie, the assassinated former assistant director Of Sierra Leone gold and Diamond-mining Corporation, a victim of the war in my Country.

My father was killed with other government officials during official hours when the rebel troops stormed and raided the mining   corporation office at the heat of the crisis in my country. A few weeks later, the rebels also invaded our residential building in which my mother and two of our security men were killed in the compound while I was out for a special research program and my younger sister was in school.

I had a singular shock and trauma, which compelled us to flee from the country to republic of Ireland with the help of an army colonel, who is a close friend of my late father, I have degree in marketing and I would have further my education if not for the death of my parents. I have never worked to earn my living since my late parents had enough wealth for us.

I am contacting you now because of the present difficulty i am facing. Unfortunately my father's two accounts in West Africa have recently been frozen, however this did not affect the twenty million six hundred thousand US Dollars (us$ 20,600,000.00), which he deposited with a security company in UK.
For now, I am having every information and document needed for the collection of the deposit with the security company and i want you to act as the beneficiary of the deposit for easy and smooth collection to your account abroad for investment purposes.

You will no doubt be adequately compensated with as well as a percentage of the profit from investment of the fund. Also you will see to it that my sister and I come over to your country at the earliest possible time. I am making this request to you with tears in my eyes and I feel that god almighty will touch you with his spirit to listen to my cry for help and answer me without delay.

Since our Parents is no more and this is the only hope for life. 
Your positive response will give me the greatest joy and relief. 
God bless you for your kind assistance we have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum.

 Seriously waiting for your urgent reply.

Best regard.

Greetings from Mrs. M. Abacha,

l am sorry for the embarrassment this my letter might cause you as we have not had any correspondence before this letter. I got your contact address through your country's embassy and high commissions here in Lagos Nigeria,during my research for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who i will do business with, though l did not disclose the nature of the business l intend to do with whoever they will recommend for me for security reasons. 

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA (A Moslem), wife and the widow of the late Nigeria Military Head of State, Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial business relationship.

l currently have within my reach the sum of Twelve Million US Dollars (US$12,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment purposes, like Real Estates Development specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant.  The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of  USD$12,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l a director. Right now, the new Civilian Government headed by president olusegun obasanjo have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw this US$12,000,000.00 from our  company's vault and deposited it with another Security Company for safe keeping. l have since declared our Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existedconcerning the money traceable by the government because  there is no documentation showing that we received this money from our Russian business partners.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of (BBC World News of 12th August & 4th September 2000). You can check it through their contact website at

The present civilian government in Nigeria had seized and frozen all our bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is highly needed in proceeding to the Security Company and claim this fund for onward invesment in your country. l proposed a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 5% for offsetting all minor expenses incurred in the course of this Transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop all further contacts. 

All correspondence must be by my private email address above. I will give you my particulars including my personal picture for you to know me very clearly when l hear from you.

I will also scan and send to you a copy of my photograph for your record keeping. Pls Note that some times to come,You might receive some messages that looks like this but you don't need to respond back to such messages because they are ikely to be our family enemies and impersonators who are trying to know the current  financial strenght of my late husband. (Sani Abacha).

NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family by the present civilian government headed by president olusegun obasanjo, l have decided that this transaction transaction will exist between you and my family Attorney and also my son,Abba Abacha, Therefore you can contact my son through our contact telephone numbers at: 234-80-33464921.

Dr. Tunde Cole. 
Block 4 Federal Secretariat Complex, 
#16 Norman Williams Way. 
Ikoyi-Lagos 

ATTENTION: 

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 

I am Dr. Tunde Cole the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. 

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of USD$31,500,000.00 (thirty one million five hundred thousand united state Dollars). 

This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, 
the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transaction the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having 
my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by responding to this email so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year. 

Thanks and God bless. 

Dr.Tunde Cole.

,mjc@kia.co.krpoltroon,,Dear Good Friend.,"Dear Good Friend.

      I am Mrs Tina Williams from Solomon Islands. I am married to Mr. Lobi
Williams who worked with our Embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before
he died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a child.
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.

     Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death
I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which
the Bible is against.

    When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.5 Million
with a Bank in Cote D lvoire. Presently this money is still in the custody
of the Bank in Cote D lvoire.

    Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight
months due to cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate
this fund to a church,organization or good person that will utilize this
money the way I am going to instruct herein.

    I want a church,organization or good person that will use this fund
for orphanages, widows and other peoples that needs help and also propagating
the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.

   The Bible made us to understand that""Blessed is the hand that giveth"".
l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this
money and my husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all because
they are the one that responsible for the death of my husband in other to
have all my late husband prperties and I don't want my husband's efforts
to be used by those that conspired for his death.

      This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence
I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the
Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the lord will fight my case and I shall
hold my peace"".

     I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of
my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.
I don't want them to know about this development and l know that With God
all things are possible.

     As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
Bank in Cote d' lvoire. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the
bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want
you, church or the organization to always pray for me because the lord is
my only shephard.

      My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever
that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please
always be prayerful all through your life.
Contact me on the this email address and any delay in your reply will give
me room in sourcing another good person, church,organization for this same
purpose.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

Hoping to receive your response immedaitely.

Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.

l remain yours sister in Christ.

It was my consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne out of our beleive in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-region.  The original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)This balanceis suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice.I intend to pay out this fund now as the organisation is winding up its activities. Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise,assistance andpartnership in your country.  I have however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of the entire sum ascompensation,why 55% will be held on trust for me while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost if any,during the course of the transactions.This transaction will be successfully concluded within 5-7 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings.

We hope to retire peacefullyand lead a honourable business life afterwards. There are no risks involved.  Well, this is the sharing ratio of this $14.3M for both of us:- 1) I want you to know that my 55% from this fund $14.3M is: $ 7,865,000 :00. 2) While your own 40% from this fund $14.3M is: $5,720,000:00. 3) While 5% from this fund $14.3M for any expenses Made by you and me is: $7,15,000:00.

Daniel Kargbu <dankar3@zwallet.com>,R@M,"Sun, 03 Aug 2003 16:43:46 +0000",MY DEAR !,"From;Mr.Daniel Kargbu and Family, 
         Lome. Republic of Togo. 

My Dear , 

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. 
My name is Mr.Daniel Smith Kargbu , the second son of Retired Major.George Smith Kargbu , of Monrovia Liberia,.At the height of the current political crises in our country,in which the rebel group of the opposition party in our country slain and ripp off the supporters of our president,Mr Charles Taylor,in their efforts to reclaim power in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 6th of July,2003, in their struggle to protect some civilians who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a retired major with our countrys army and a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the civilians by the rebel group in which they force the younger civilians to fight with guns and grenades and in the process loose either their lives or some parts of their body upon refusal !
 to take the ammunition for war.I therefore decided to move my mother and my younger sister and brother to the Republic of Togo for refuge,where we presently stay without anything and without any source of livelyhood. 


During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death with my elder brother in the night of that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving grown up son of my father,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Republic of Togo finally.And also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money before it is dictated out and blocked by the incoming regime in our country, and also to improve my familys worsening condition at present. 

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me; 

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to their office here in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear and accomodate this money for my family . 
2. To finally assist us in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years after I must have joined you first. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our unexpected bad situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help. 
Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request. 

Best Regards, 
Mr.Daniel Kargbu and family.

On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant  domiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million  two hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet  investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago  with his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the  account and no other person knows about this account.  I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner  and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy  foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c  is a foreigner and from Australia in particular.  I am certainly sure that  he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no beneficiary and  nobody will come again for the claim of this money.  It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the  account holder which I will provide to you if you are interested, therefore  I need your cooperation in this transaction. The difference in country of  origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. This money  will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund  out to a foreign account.  I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to  claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide  your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement that  will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to  nominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct  phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in  handling this transaction.  At the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total  transfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any  expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The  fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer  USD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you after the  successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will   have the remaining balance  of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account  only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any  disappointment from your side.  Have a nice day as I entrust this transfer into your hands.  Finaly reply to this e-Mail address bellow if you are willing to do this  business with me.   Best Regards, Mr. Jenif Davix.

DAKAR, SENEGAL.

Assalamaulakum.

My Dear Friend,

Compliments of the day.I did like to send to you the best wishes of good 
health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as 
contained in this letter. After due deliberation with my son,I decided to 
forward to you this business proposal, we want you to assist us .I will give 
you more information. As to this regard as soon as you reply.

I am Mrs.Estelle Mamadou . I am contacting you with the hope that you will 
be of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of 
7.3 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes.

I therefore personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your 
urgent assistance to move this money in to your country where I believe it 
will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of 
movement imposed on the members of my family by the Senegal Government.

This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband 
and a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my husbands 
share .Presently, the Government has intensified their probe in to my 
husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our 
accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and 
the arrest of my First son.

In view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of 
our finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the 
money in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this 
fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we 
have such funds.

Further more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four years 
following the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder 
and corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after 
the president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he 
is still under interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital 
documents.

Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my 
family,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in 
transferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to 
invest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist 
me.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.

I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere 
like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start 
all over again if only you wish. I shall ask my son Mohammade to come over 
to your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies you. please 
do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in 
total trust and confidence.

Please kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal 
telephone and fax numbers. Conclusively,we have decided part with 25% of the 
total sum. of the total sum,10% will be for expenses incurred during 
thecause of this transaction, while 65% is to be held on trust by you until 
we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent 
to our free movement by the Senegal Government.

I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.
Your URGENT response is needed.

Regards and God Bless you.

Mrs.Estelle Mamadou .

Dear Friend,  Permit the manner with which I am seeking your assistance but I am short of options and have no other choice. I am Jonathan Charles from the hospitality state ( Mississippi ), an army contractor attached to the US Military force in Iraq . The reason why I’m contacting you is to explain my findings to you and to seek for your assistance to enable you contributes immensely to the actualization of my dream.   
I am attached to the US army for the sole purpose of reconstruction work in some parts of Iraq . As you know very well Iraq is gradually undergoing a rebuilding process in some parts and there is much need for reconstruction which was why I was invited. I evaluate the level of destruction and offer professional advice in line with the way they intend rebuilding and reconstructing damaged facilities. Work has been risky no doubt and challenging as sometimes we are faced hard on with armed insurgents where we lose some soldiers during confrontation. I have had my own share of losses as I lost a friend whom I have known for 12 years. On the 27th day of March 2007, at about 11:00 hrs during a normal inspection routine along Haifa Street where there is long rough high-rise buildings which were built and occupied by the late Saddam Hussein when he was alive, I with other 3 soldiers proceeded to a marked site and as I commenced evaluation work while I was closely guided by soldiers, I discovered an unusual bulge in a cellar which I presumed to be a storage room, I decided to have a look at it, only for me to kick the metal covering and find a metal boxes (5 in number) piled on top one another which were locked with a padlock each with a sign written in each of them.  Upon forcing the boxes open, we discovered several guns, amour and some boxes amongst which two contained guns and bullets, one filled with hard drugs (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contained some US Dollars and kilograms of alluvial Gold, which we counted and discovered that the money in one of the boxes amounted to $9.2 Million. I believe the boxes owned and linked to the Al Qaeda and Ayman al-Zawahiri. I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have the money and alluvial Gold to our selves, they all agreed to the plan of getting the money out of the country, but first we had to hide the money and alluvial Gold in some safe and untraceable location. We secretly kept the boxes in a safer place after which we handed over the drugs and the weapons to our superiors. 
I am now in desperate need of a “Reliable and Trustworthy” person like you who would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars and alluvial Gold for me until my assignment elapses here. We cannot afford to leave the boxes here in Iraq for any reason since Iraq is getting unsafe and dangerous everyday. We have no idea what could happen next as everything remains inconclusive at this point. I am fully aware of what your thoughts would be next, but on receiver of your response, I will send my picture as well as my Identity, for you to know whom you are dealing with. I assure and promise to give you 15% of this fund and some quantity of the alluvial Gold, please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret within you so that my job would not be jeopardized.  My Sincere Regards,Jonathan Charles.You can contact me with my private email: jonathancharles01@yahoo.co.in

                         Request For Foreign Partner

Dear Sir,

I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust to enable my 
colleagues and I carry out an urgent business opportunity in my 
department.
I work with the Union Bank of Nigeria PLC: currently I am the senior 
manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my
 bank. I was the account officer to one Mr. Ali B. Ashraf who died along
 with his family on the 8th of November 1998 in an ADC Boeing 747 plane 
crash at Egirin River. All 141 passengers on board were feared dead.He 
left
in his domiciliary account the total sum of $15.5million Fifteen million
 five hundred thousand USA Dollars. Since the management got the 
information of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or 
his next of kin to come up and claim his money. Unfortunately
from the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his 
relation or friends has come up for the claim. The banking and financial
 law of Union
bank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed 
after a period of four (4) it will be transferred into the bank treasury
 as unclaimed bill.On this discovery sir, I and two other senior staffs 
now
decided do business with you and release the money to you as the next of
 kin to Ali B. Ashraf for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will 
soon proceed
for my retirement leave this year, and I personally do not want this 
fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is
 why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my
retirement.

The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by
 the fact that the customer Mr. Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a 
Nigerian cannot
stand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that
20% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner; thereafter my 
colleague and I will visit your country for disbursement according to 
the percentages
indicated.

To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account,you
 will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased,indicating
 your bank account number and location wherein the money will be 
remitted.Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest,I
 will send to you the text of the application that you will send to the 
Union Bank
authority for an approval to submit your claims.

Send your reply through my direct and private email
address:abdulkareem_39@rediff.com or abdulkareem_39@tiscali.co.uk indicates your direct Fax and telephone
 numbers for effective communication that this transaction needs. Do not
 reply through the union bank email address because it belonged to the 
senior staffs for public use.

Please note that you are not to appear in person, as every thing 
regarding this project will be strictly on documentations and every 
banking documents needed for this transaction will be taken care of by

GREETINGS,

Based on the information and recommendation I got about quick growth of 
business, investment and commerce in your country, I deemed it necessary to 
write and inform you about my interest to invest in any viable venture in 
joint partnership with you.

I am Mrs Rita Abed the first wife of king George Abed K.S.M the king of 
mende tribe in Sierra-Leone. On the 19th May, 2004 my husband was murdered 
by some rebel group on the accusation that he is a great sponsor and in 
support to restore the democratically elected President of Alhadji Tejan 
Kabba. Almost half of the palace was burnt.Fortunately I was not in the 
place when they raided the palace my husband married 4 wives with 16 
children two of the wives, with my 3 children where murdered in cold blood 
while my second son escape the incident with bullet wounds on his right leg 
at the moment where the remaining families are I don?t know their way about 
whether they are alive or not. Right now I am left alone with only one son 
since the sudden assassination of my husband the family has been displaced 
and totally disorganized left with noting.
Early that year befor my husband was Late husband was murdered he came back 
from travel and gave me some document to keep for him as usual he told me 
that he deposited 18.5 million USD in a trunk box with private security 
company in Abidjan Cte d?Ivoire as a family treasure. So I decided to go 
and search for the documents where I use to keep them I discovered the 
documents covering the deposit he made with the company and some other 
documents like his will and other documents for his business. As my town has 
been
a serious war zone, I made arrangement with two peace keeping force to help 
me and my son move out of the country, however we moved out of Sierra-Leone 
successfully, to Abidjan Cte d?Ivoire where we are now. I have gone and 
conform the deposit with the
company with all the documents all the documents are with me here.
Now I wish to transfer these funds abroad and enter
into a business venture as the country (Cte d?Ivoire) is no longer in peace 
since they conducted their Presidential election on the 22nd October 2004 
the country has witness all sort of political unrest
ranging from ethnic clash which resulted to killing of innocent citizens and 
strangers people are living in fears as the country is no longer that 
peaceful nation as it was before due to this reason that I have
decided to contact you, to assist me to lift this my consignment out of this 
country. Please I need your assistance. Waiting for your urgent reply.Thanks 
and God bless.
Best regards.(rita_02555abed@yahoo.com)

dr kabo hammed <ka_hammed@fsmail.net>,ka_hammed@fsmail.net,"Sun, 30 Nov 2003 16:03:11 +0100",We can do this,"
Dear Sir, 




I am DR KABO HAMMED




I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil
consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered
time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months,
valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five
hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity,
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a
reminder and finally we discovered from his contract 
employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident 
with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On 
further investigation, I found out that he did not 
leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin 
were fruitless. 




I therefore made further investigation and discovered 
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n
all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still
sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
No one will come forward to claim it. 
According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5
(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim
the funds. 




Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry
Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide me
immediately with your full names and address so that
the attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits, which will put you in place as the
next of kin.
 
We shall employ the services of two attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. 




There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via
email. Upon your response, I shall then provide you
with more details and relevant documents that will
help you Understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable
for both of us because I shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country. 




Awaiting your urgent reply via email:dr_kabortsb@yahoo.com




Thanks and regards
 
DR KABO HAMMED

  My name is Mrs elizabeth jemma. 
I came in contact with your profile and therefore picked interest for a business relationship with you,though I have not met with you before but I believe one has to risk, confiding in someone to
succeed sometimes in life
  .
  I was married to Dr.Williams jemma who worked with Cote'd Ivoire embassy in Sierra Leone for nine years before he died in the year 2003
  We were both married for eight years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only nine days.
  When my late husband was sitll alive he deposited some amount of money  with a security firm here in Abidjan,$22.4 Million.(twenty two Million Four hundred thousand U.S.D). At the point of his death he told me of this money and directed me where the documents partaning the deposit was.He told me that I am the only beneficiary as he believes that his family was behind his illness.Presently, this money is still with the Security Firm.(Name of the security company withheld now for personal reasons)
   
  I am looking for a God fearing foreign partner who will help to retreive
this money from the security company and retransfer it into his /her
account outside Africa for investment purposes.
  The political stuations here in Africa did not give any encauragement for investors or investments.
  As soon as I receive your reply mail I shall give you the contact of the
Company.I will also issue to you a letter of authority that will empower you as the beneficiary of this fund.I have decided that you will get 15% of the total amount for your assistace to me immediately after the conclussion of the transaction.
  
I would like the money to be managed in a profitable manner preferably a
joint venture business with you if possible.
  Please I will like you to note that this money is of no criminal origin as my my late husband was a subsdiary agent of Gold miners associations in Sierra Leone before his death.
Hoping to hear from you asap.
  Best wishes,
Mrs elizabeth

TEL:+27 83 740 2698

ATTENTION:C.E.O,

I am MR.FRANK SHABALALA, an officer incharge of delivery department in Operations GLOBAL SECURITY COMPANY,SOUTH AFRICA. Here in south Africa,Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa.

I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through a consultant company base on my research for a trustworthy and established person that understands investment ethic for entering into a life time profitable joint partnership investment and also co-operation with confidence and trust that you will keep the contents secret and not divulged to any third  party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward  to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment had accumulated we discovered that our client was the former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care.

Since the death of our client President Mobutou Sese seko, none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to scanned the  box after some of workers have been dismissed for the day l find out that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the  box that were registered as treasurer by our client actually contained a considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to about US$35million Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing plans secretly. 

I also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client  siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was in office as head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to this money in our care. I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for immediate investment with your assistance.

I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt  of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country, all the  documents that covers this box of consignment will be send to you  so that you as far as l concern.

you have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper documentation.  This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. Please reply to the above email address with your telephone and fax so that i can call you. 

Thanks.
Yours faithfully.
MR.FRANK SHABALALA.

Dan Wilson <dan@danielm.org>,R@E,"Sat, 22 May 2004 17:38:12 -0600",Urgent Business Proposal,"Kenya Commercial Bank
City Centre, 
P.O. Box 44252,Nairobi.
Kenya 
Email:dan@danielm.org


Dear Sir/Madam, 

May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It 
is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting 
between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the 
business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of both parties and 
appropriate shares accordingly.

I am Dan Wilson Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an urgent and very 
confidential business proposition. 

On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry Of Energy, 
Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at 
US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. 
Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we 
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the National Petroleum 
Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. 

On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next 
of kin was fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any kin or 
relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 
US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward 
to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money 
which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a 
foreign account. 

I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my 
attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and 
address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the 
beneficiary of the funds. 

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.The paperwork 
for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this 
transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide 
you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable 
for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. 

Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax 
mostly. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:


Thanks and my regards. 

Dan Wilson 
Branch Manager

  My Dear,
   
  Good a thing to write you. I have a proposal for you this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will.  I am Miss Miss Rebecca David ,19years old and the only Daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.David. My father was a highly reputable busnness
 magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.june 2005.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle
 of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth!
   
  My mother died when I was just 6 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on 12th june 2005, he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him th at he has the sum of six million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$6.700,000)
 deposit security company in Europe.He further told him that he
deposited the money in my name,and finally issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of all the necessary but legal documents to this fund and the security firm.
   
  I am just 19years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what  to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis  here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually
 brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.
   
  Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 

   
  1. Can you honestly my guidian? 
2. Can I completely trust you? 
3. What percentage of the total amount in question 
will be good for you after the money is in your
account? 
   
  Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. 
   
  Thank you so much.
   
  My sincere regards

  Miss Rebecca David

Dr Ben Mboye <deboyedoctor@netscape.net>,R@S,"Mon, 22 Aug 2005 21:26:36 +0200",VERY   URGENT,"  
My Dear Friend,
 My name is Dr. Ben Mboye, a Uganda national. I was the Permanent Secretary of Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon together.
 Due to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel forces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for the purchases, I was told to prepare a ?contract? for the purchases of the Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial
 gains.
 When Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence.   Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public services.
 PLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. Steve Charles to be in charge of my projects.    
 The money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a German national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Steve Charles who is currently in europe to transact this business with you since I want my identity to be kept out of the money.
 What I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Steve Charles whom is to represent my interest in this transaction, He is currently in europe. As soon as you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: stvchar1@netscape.net .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence that I repose on you. l will render you 25% of this money and 5% will go for other expenses. . You ca
 n also reach me true Mr Steve Charles
 As you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly confirm your telephone and fax number  to Mr. Steve Charles. Bear in mind that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your response.
 Kind personal regards,
 DR. BEN MBOYE.

EMAIL:peterclark1@katamail.com 

Dear Friend. 

I am Rev. Fr. peter clark, a senior staff with the World Bank fact finding & special duties office. I am writing you this letter based on the fact that cool penny is better than millions of dollars means it's better for one to live and die poor honest man than a rich dishonest one.I and the Chief security officer (CSO) of this organisation and have arranged with an officer in the computer section in person of Engineer 
Peter Cliff to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LM-05-371) amounting to US$10 million. Why we did this is 
because according to information gathered from the bank�s/security computer, you have been waiting for a long time to receive this payment without success. As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. The problem we feel you are having is that of interest groups. A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday. Also we found out that some of the officials of the parastatals have been extorting a lot of money from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers. For security reasons you do not have to tell anybody that your have your payment on the way until the payment gets to you. 

The said payment is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get this box shipped to you I and the (CSO) Yesterday 
went to this four courier companies Dhl, Ems, FedEx and Ups to make arrangements on how to get the box shipped to you by courier, but to no avail the above courier companies all made us to understand that the will have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment. This is something we want to avoid because this box is been padded with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine. We told the courier services that the box contained film materials and when open will spoil the matrials. N:B we did not declare money because courier does not carry money. Today a friend of mine who is diplomat disclosed to me that there is a 
security courier service company that is specialised in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another, which also 
has diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world. I have therefore met the oficial 
of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them, which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat who will be bring in this consignment to you is an expact and has been in this line of work for many years now so we have Ntting to worry about. After all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500,000.00) to any charity organisation I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect, you will send to us a promissory note for the doation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by courier. Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of 
problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not inform anyone about this until you received your money. Am 
helping you on this because something in me is tells me that you are an honest person. When you conclude this and you send our promise, 
we will help to ship the final part of your money to you.May God be with you as i wait for your response either through Fax or Email:

Dr. Ojei Uloaku <ojeiuloaku05@hotmail.com>,,"Sat, 24 Dec 2005 04:47:08 -0900",Charity Funds / Trustee Needed,"Dear Trustee,

As you read this, I don't want you feeling sorry for
me, because, I believe we will all die someday.My name
is DR. OJEI ULOAKU, an oil Merchant living in Nigeria,
West Africa. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal
Cancer,which was discovered very late, due to my
laxity in caring for my health. It has defied all
forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a
few months to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,
I fought against the abolition of apartheid and l was
a member of the leading party in Nigeria always
hostile to people especially my fellow Blacks and l
only focused on my business and the dominance of the
white supremacy as that was the only thing I cared
for. But now I regret all these,as I now know that
there is more to life than just wanting to have or
make all the money in the world. I believe
reincarnation when l have a second chance to come to
this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it.

So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations e.g. the National Union of Ivory Coast
Students (NUIVS) in Ivory Coast, Romania and
Afghanistan. Now that my health has deteriorated so
badly, I cannot do this my self anymore. I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts and
distribute the money, which I have there to charity
organization and to the less privileged in Bulgaria
and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them, and have not learn the lesson of all been
equal in the sight of God Almighty.

The last of my money, which l had kept aside during
the dark days of political blood shed in Africa no one
knows of, is a cash deposit of Eighty Four Million
United States Dollars (US$84,000,000.00) that I have
with a bank in Nigeria for safekeeping. I will want
you to help me collect this deposit and disburse it to
charity organizations and to the less privileged,based
on the reason l kept the money, was to do evil, l want
it now to be used for the good of all mankind.Please
send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in
this disbursement.
God will reward you for your time and patience.
I wait to hear from you, may Almighty God be with you
and your entire family.
Yours in the Lord.  Call me at +234 803 384 8734.

Best regards

Dr. Ojei Uloaku.

 d on the struggle.He left message that i should  sell off all our assets including the farms,estates and the companies  ensuring that his family relocates oversea and also to invest the money  propperly bearing in mined that the next step of the guerillas will be  to confiscate those remaining assets.   I have successfully sold off the remaining portion of our estate ,  companies and farms after which i managed with the help of the  immigration to sneak out of zimbabwe with my partner's family to  Dubai,so  right now we are in Dubai(UAE).The total sum in our possession at this  moment is US$18.5M(eighteen million and five hundred thousand dollers)  realised from the aution sales of the estate,farms and companies.

my name is aishatu ahmed.my father was recently murdered in tripoli as a result of family and friends conflicts due to a substantial amount he made while he was in the ministry.generally,most rich men keep such fund at their homes as it is illegal for one to keep such amount in any bank in lybia without a proper explaination as per how such fund was made .so these wicked people thought that this fund was still in our mansion and they tried to eliminate all our house hold in order to get free access to our home to search for it  unknowing to them that my late father had already moved the fund to a finance house in europe through diplomatic means leaving me as the beneficiary as if he forsaw the danger in our family.just one week after his burial,these people broke into our home with gun shots everywhere which resulted to the death of my only little brother.that very night,i and my mother escaped and ran to a country(by road) called burkina faso where we ar!

MRSJENNIFER KOBE <mrsjennikobe@hknetmail.com>,R@M,"Sat, 09 Jun 2001 05:32:28 +0200",I NEED YOU URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE.,"Dear Sir/madam

This business proposal to you is strictly confidential, with due respect.Sorry at this perceived confusion or stress you may have receiving this letter from me, Since we have not known our selves or met previously.Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the urgency of it.By way of self introduction, I am Mrs. jennifer kobe, the wife of late Brigadier - Gen.Maxwell Kobe former ECOMOG ARMY COMMANDER [West African peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone] who died in the Sierra Leone civil disturbance[War]. My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and traditional norms.

We have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband
had, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses and his bank particular seized by them. I
wanted to escape to the United State of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my international passport and other traveling document to further frustrate me.

Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company abroad, that my late husband deposited U.S$15.5 Million cash with this company. It has therefore, become very necessary and urgent to contact someone, a foreigner like you to help me receive/secure these funds overseas in a reliable bank Account(presumably an empty Bank Account, if vailable) and to help invest it on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country.

These funds are kept on an ""OPEN BENEFICIARY MANDATE""with the Security
Company to avoid detection, seizure or diversion. I have had several
telephone discussions with the Assistant Director of the security
company,who has express willingness to help me on meeting the
company's demands. This is why I have contacted you to help save 
my children and I, receive these funds on our behalf. But, you would 
need to give me sufficient assurance that if you help me, you would 
not divert the funds. My children and I have resolved to give you 
20% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got to live on.

I wish to state here that we are left with nothing as we survive by the
grace of God. I hope you understand our predicament so as to save me and my family from hopeless future (S.O.S.)

We want to believe that you will not withhold the money when finally paid into your account. I want you to understand that there is no risk involved as we have perfected all modalities for the smooth actualization of this transaction. The boxes,is presently  in a security vault of  the said security company at their offshore office. 


You are hereby,expected to forward the following:

1] Your international passport details or driving license to assure us about your person. 


I will send the following: 
(1) The receipt of the shipment Airway Bill for the consignment and  the password being the security code will be forwarded to you as soon as you indicate you sincere interest to fully assist us. 
(2) The deposit certificate 
(3)The Diplomatic shipment certificate.

All these will be sent to you as they will be required from you by the security company at the point of retrieving the consignment from their offshore office us all.  The secret codes (e.g Pin No., Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help me.

NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family,
l have decided  That this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy and as 
such all phone contacts should be through my lawyer

Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your private phone / mobile No and also your fax no for easier communication.

Dear Sir, 
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on
behalf of my colleagues. Your information were given
to me by a member of the South African Export
Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black
Economic Empowerment Commission (Government)
delegation on a trip to the United States during a
bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign
investors. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder
for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep
it confidential because of the nature of this
business. 
Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work
as the Director of Project Implementation, with
co-operation of two other top officials, we have in
our possession, an overdue payment in US funds. 
The said funds represent certain percentage of the
contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced to the amount of
US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual
contract cost has been paid to the original
contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. 
The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe
that private investment in general, and foreign direct
investment in particular, are the real engines for
sustainable economic development, for which reason it
has continued to encouraged investment in the key
growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere
determination to pay foreign contractors all debts
owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close
relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation
with foreign governments and non-governmental
financial agencies. As a result we included our bills
for approvals with the co-operation of some officials
at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of
South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to
be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we
are not allowed to operate foreign account. The
changing of beneficiary's information/ details and
other forms of documentation upon application for
claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals
will be secured on behalf of your company or your
self. 
I have the authority of my colleagues involved to
propose that, should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be
20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and
the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all
expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so
incurred. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of the nature described here. The
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and subcontracted it to other companies. More often
than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated
fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more
specialized firms for execution. 
This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat
it with utmost confidentiality. Also your
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I
have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further
details, upon your acceptance of this proposal.Pls send 
all correspondence to potobo1@netscape.net

Engr Paul O. Otobo.

 From . Mr. Moreno Garcia.

Date: 21 - 06 -2007.

Kindest Attention:

My name is Mr. Moreno Garcia. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed with
Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and  
right now
I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have
not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for  
anyone (not
even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I
was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the
only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is
more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I
believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I  
would live my
life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few  
close friends
  .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have  
decided to give
alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to be one of
the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some
charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated so
badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to
close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there  
to charity
organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and
kept the money to themselves.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what
I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000, 000.00) that I
have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you to
help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and use
it to help those in Need.

N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami,
Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other
Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am using
my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-mail
if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.

God be with you.

Mr. Moreno Garcia.

STATUS & NATURE OF TRANSACTION:

account for this long period, I decided to carry out a system investigation
and discovered that non of the family member nor relations of the late
person is aware of this account. This is the story in a nutshell. Now I
want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this
funds.Thereafter,I had planned to destroy all related documents for this
account. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months I have
worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation. 

The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated
interest the balance in this account stands at-(US$14 million US dollars).

Now our questions are:- 

1. Can you handle this project? 

2. Can I give you this trust? 

3. What will be your commission? If you can sponsor this transfer. 

Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible. Finally, it is our
humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the
necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. I Expect

Union Bank Plc.
Lagos � Nigeria. 

I am the manager of bill and exchange Foreign
Operations Department of Union Bank of Nigeria. I am
writing following an impressive information about you
through one of my friend who runs a consultancy firm.
He assured of your capability and reliability,
although I did not tell him the details of the
business I want to do with you. 

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 
$11.5million dollars (Eleven million five hundred
thousand United States Dollars) in an account that
belongs to one of our foreign customers who died
along side his entire family on 2002 E.A.S plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have
been expecting his relation to come over and claim his
money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Unfortunately we learnt that all his immediate family
members died along with him at the plane
crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund
behind for the claim since the account is his private
account. It is therefore upon this discovery that I
and two other officials in this department now decided
to make business with you and release the money to
you as the next of kin to the deceased for safety
keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is
coming for it and we don�t want this money to go back
into Federal
Government account as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that
such money remained after Seven years the money will
be transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed
funds and will further be handed over to government.
The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer
was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of
kin to a foreigner.

We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as
foreign partner, while the balance will be for my
colleagues and I. I will visit your country for the
disbursement according to the percentages indicated
above once this money gets into your account. Please
be honest to me. 

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the
funds to you as arranged, you must apply first to my
bank as next of kin of the deceased. Upon receipt of
your response I will send to you a text of the
application with the name of the deceased and his
country and other information about him.

Note this transaction is confidential and 
risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you
should contact me through my e-mail address or
alternative email address ahmedmartins10@juno.com

I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics, 
which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life, But please 
treat with absolute secrecy and personal. I pray that this email reaches you 
in the best of health.

Mr Alpha Kone the manager of bill and  exchange at the foreign remittance 
department Bank Of Africa. In my  department we discoveredan  abandoned sum 
of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred thousand US dollars) in an 
account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his 
family in the 2000 in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next 
of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  
indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at 
the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this 
business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or 
relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank 
treasury as   unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained 
unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank  
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by
the fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you 
as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for 
expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.

Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this

My name is Ahmed Tankoh,the only son of late Mr.Hassan Tankoh who was the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries plc.SCAFECAO)""Bouake"" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
You can find the story on this website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm
On 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.
After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.
That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 30%of the total amount for your assistance .
Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce you to the Bank where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer. So you can contact me through my alternate email adress for security reason.
Email ahmedtankoh200@yahoo.comI am waiting for your response.
Thanks and God bless.
Ahmed Tankoh .

I got your e-mail contacts from computerised datas after my extensive search 
via the website for a God-fearing and trust-worthy person to  bestow this 
transaction which is the only hope of our survival into his or her 
hands.When i got your address,I prayed and meditated fervently over it and i 
commited it into the hands of God that you should be the rightful person to 
help us out before I made up my decision to contact you.I am The Manager of 
Auditing Department of Our Bank ,Ouagadougou Burkina Faso.In my department 
we discovered an abandoned  sum of USD$15.m(Fifteen   million  united states 
dollars). In an account that belongs to this our foreign customer who died 
along with his wife and and children in the plane crash.Since we got 
information about his death,
we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money 
because
we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or 
relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but 
unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died 
alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It 
is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this usiness

proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to 
the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming 
for it because I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such 
money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into 
the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner in this 
transaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner,I agree that 30% of 
this money will be for you as foreigner partner in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account. 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the 
business and 60% would be for me ,

After which I shallvisit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this 
fund to you as I have arranged,you will furnished me with a good receiving 
account details where
the money will betransfered,your private tel and fax number for easy 
communication.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text of 
the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance 
manager,for easy execution of the transaction.I will not fail to bring to 
your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side. As all 
required arrangement have been made for the transfer and more so all the 
documents backing this claim will be supplied to you after you might have 
applied.Please I would like you you keep this transaction confidential and 
as a top secret as you may wish to know that I am a senior Bank 
official.Trusting to hear from you immediately.

  Dear Sir,

Greetings . I am Hon. Rajesh Anand Bhagwan,MP.Republic of Mauritius. Presently I am the Minister of Enviroment and National Development Unit,under the Government of Prime Minister Hon. Paul Raymond .Acting in my capacity, I awarded a number of large Government building/construction contracts to a German Construction firm(Philipp Holzmann AG in Frankfurt am Main) worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In the execution of this project the German firm discovered a colossal amount of precious stones in one of the sites. I collaborated with this firm in a mutual agreement as regards the proceeds of which I have now received my share of exactly US $48 million.I cannot introduce or circulate this amount into the Mauritian banking system considering my provisional duty as a minister, also earning less than $1000 equivalent of Mauritian Rupee (our local currency) and the strict stipulations of the Bureau of conduct guidelines and regulations for Public/Civil servants. Furthermore, Groups of persons'in the Government have ganged up against me, with false allegations of an intention by me to contest the next presidential elections .This has caused disent and discontent in my party circles, now prompting my decision to take flight with my family ,hence my soliciting your co-operation to take delivery of the funds into your custody for investment purposes .25% of the entire funds will be apportioned to you for your efforts and assistance I implore you to accord this transaction the confidentiality and secrecy it deserves no matter what your decision may be.

I urgently await your response!

MANAGER CREDIT AND FOREIGN BILLS.
UNION BANK PLC.

My name is Bello Ali the manager, credit and foreign bills of Union Bank Nigeria Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,1998.

Since the demise of this client customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of USD$.30 m, [Thirty million United States dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no one has come up to be the next of kin.

And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than five years, after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds after this period. In view of this I got your contact from a business contact enquiry. Note that you do not need to have similar names with the late beneficiary. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will commence on manipulating your information into the file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend to actualize our objective in a legal manner.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after your claim is established as the certified next of kin to
The deceased. 

When you receive this letter. Kindly, send me your private Tel/Fax Numbers for quick communication.
Awaiting your favorable response.

Yours truly,

My name is Mrs. Catherine O�Connor. I trained and work as an external auditor for the International Financial Services Ltd for Anglo Irish Bank. Working as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Republic of Ireland region. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours. 
On routine audit check last month, I discovered some investment accounts that has been dormant for the last twelve(12) years. All the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above ($17.1 Million United States Dollars) plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in Ireland demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal. 
My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1993�the exact time the account was last operated, I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died interstate and no next�of�kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years. 
I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working with you can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Irish Government. This is especially possible as you bear the same LAST NAME to the said investor, and can stand as his extended relative. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation. 
I have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with have agreed to allocate a 30% of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses. 
I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate. 
Be assured that me and my colleagues are on top of the situation. There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. 
To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction come to a successful conclusion, I have intentionally left out the finer details. 
To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please contact me through email, telephone/fax stating the followings for my confirmation:

Good Day

Mr. A.G. Furness

Branch Manager

Bank of Cyprus

London Branch 

Dear Friend,

I am Mr. A.G Furness The Branch Manager of the Bank of Cyprus, London. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.In December, 2001, an American Oil consultant/contractor Mr.Jeffrey Paul Mead made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for Twenty-Four calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After some months, we sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, that Mr.Jeffrey Paul Mead passed away. 

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mead did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one has ever come forward to claim it. 

According to Banking Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Jeffrey Paul Mead so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the

transfer. 

A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the

beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately to my alternative email address above and below and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I can be reached through this email address. 

I do urgently await your response. 

Best regards,

Mr. A.G. Furness

Dear Friend,

    Compliments of the day, I hope that this letter will not constitute a sort
of embarrasement to you. Please bear with me let me introduce myself. I am
Barrister Tony Abbas, the attorney to Late Engr Alex, a National of your
country, who owned a metal producing factory (Metalco Enterprise) in Nigeria
and a personal friend died and left behind his deposit in a finance house
(GLOBAL SECURITIES & FINANCE COMPANY) valued at $14.5Millon (Fourteen Million
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only).

    My relationship with Engr.Alex started in 1999 when I was working
with the security company as a Legal Adviser, Marina branch. We met in my social
club's annual end of the year party and I introduced him to the said security
company where he deposit most of his treasures some few weeks later,making me
the Legal officer to the account which he operated until his unfortunate
demise.On the 31st of March 2001, Engr.Alex, his wife and their two children
were involved in a car accident. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately
lost their lives.
    After the incident i contacted Engr.Alex sister (Ms Martha Stevens)
which was his beneficiary/next of kin but unfortunately before she
could claim his estate she too died in September 11, 2001 terrorist
attack at the world trade center in the United State Of America. See
http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-name/page95.html

    Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of Engr.Alex
extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. After these
several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over
the Internet, to locate any member of his family or anyone related to him hence
I contacted you . Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for
over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the
deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$14.500,000 (Fourteen
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) can be paid to you and
then you and I can sharethe money.70% to me and 30% to you.The request of a
foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that My
client was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as a next of kin to a
foreigner.

    I am ready to re-negotiate the mode of sharing with you.Thereafter I will
visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the
percentages we agreed upon.If you find this proposal suitable for you do get
back to me with the following informations Your full Name and Contact
Address,Your private telephone Number Your Age Your Occupation and Position.

    All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal
through.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please for the sake of
confidentiality send your reply to my private email :

I am Miss Vivian Mutan ,21years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA MUTAN. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of LIBERIAN during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.  But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.  I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in LIBERIAN . The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-  1. Can I completely trust you?  2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?

Kind Attention. Sir/Madam
My name is Mr. Chin Weng Yin, I trained and work as an external auditor for the United Overseas Bank (UOB) of Singapore, working as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Asian region. I had taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavors.On routine audit check last month, I discovered some investment accounts that had been dormant for the least twelve years (Three tenures of four years each). All the accounts belong to a single holder with monies totaling a little above $10 million United States Dollars plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposing. 
My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1993-the exact time the account was last operated. I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died interstate and no next-of-kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years. I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working with you can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation. I have seized all relevant documents (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant /beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with are prepared to allocate a 20% slice of the total funds for your efforts. I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate.Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk whatsoever if you agree to make this claim on our behalf.. Needless to say, utmost confidentiality is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction to come to a successful conclusion, I have intentionally left out the finer details. To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email, stating your full name, date of birth, telephone and fax number. I do expect your prompt response then I will give you my contact number for further discussion

Dear Sir/Madam,

		HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
Greetings,

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I plead
with you to patiently read through it before making a
decision whether to assist me or not.

I wish to solicit for your assistance in this
transaction, which I strongly believe, will be of
mutual benefit to both of us.

My name is DAVIS TUTU, a branch manger of a
leading bank in South Africa (ABSA Bank), my
colleagues and I wish to seek your assistance in the
transfer of some huge sum of money (USD$35M) into a
foreign bank account.

An American national deposited this money in a fixed
deposit account in the bank, six years ago. The length
of time for the maturity of the fixed deposit was five
years, which expired towards the ending of last year.
Incidentally, MR. JEFF STEVENS, who was the
beneficiary died in the September 11th bombing of the
World Trade Center in America, and he left MR DAVID
STEVENS as the Next-of-kin to claim this money, but
unfortunately he was said to have died of cancer few months after
Jeff's death. All efforts made to trace any known
relations of both proved abortive, and no one has
written our bank in this regard.

All modalities for the successful transfer of this
money into an offshore bank account have been put in
place and we are looking for a trust worthy foreign
partner into whose bank account this fund would be
remitted to and it is in this regard that my
colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner who
will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with
20% of the total amount if you should accept to assist
us.

If you are interested in giving us the required
assistance, kindly reply this letter stating your
Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of
the secrecy surrounding this transaction, I suggest
that you send a fax me or call and i will contact you
for futher details.

I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you
soon. Feel free to ask any question in this regard.

I remain,

Yours Faithfully,

Davis Tutu

carobert1@wooow.it,,,Good day,"Dear Sir,

I have a profiling amount in an excess of US$183.5M, which I seek your partnership
in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total sum to
you for your quick assistance and partnership. However, I sincerely seek
your confidence in this transaction, which I propose to you as a TOP SECRET.

My name is Robert Bada, i am the personal assistance to the former President
of Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). You most be aware that
Charles Taylor has been fighting serious civil war with the Liberia United
for the Restoration of Democracy (LURDS) for quite some years now. And LURDS
were backed all along by some foreign powerful countries. Not quite long
ago, the American government ordered President Charles Taylor to leave Liberia
or be forced out of power. Knowing fully well the capabilities of America
and other powerful members of the United Nations, President Charles Taylor
decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country
Nigeria to seek asylum.

Based on these developments, his various foreign bank accounts have been
frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But in the light of
all these sad happenings, President Charles Taylor was able, through the
help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$183.5M, on
my name as the owner to a private security company vault in Nigeria where
the final crediting is expected to be carried out later. All the depositing
documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my possession


YOUR ROLE:
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum
and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company
transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this
only with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent
and never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylor?s conglomerates.
This transaction can be concluded in 2 weeks.
 
URGENT:
Your response is needed. I want you to call me on 234 1 7755778 for more
directives information and the nest required step of how we have to make
immediate move.  PLEASE send your REPLY to these my private email addresses:
primetimes@centrum.cz and ospectra3776@netscape.net, I will also need your
private and direct telephone and fax number for easy reach. Please this is
a very confidential matter, you don't disclose to anybody for us to have
success. As soon as I get your positive response, I will send you more details.

Best regard

                           STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know
me personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID
KUBA,the first SON of MR.PEDRO KUBA,a farmer and leader movement for
Democratic change  (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute
in Zimbabwe.

I was furnished with viable information from the International Trade
Centre here in Johannesburg and I decided to  write to you. Before the
death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of
US$40 M(FOURTY  MILLION  UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as
if he fore saw the  looming danger in Zimbabwe.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals  for
the farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land
problem  came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new
Land Act which  wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black
farmers.This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war
veterans and some lunatics in the society.
Infact, alot of people have been killed because of this land reformed Act
for which my father was one of the victims.

It is against this  background, that I and my family who are currently
staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's  money to foreign
account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker)
to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction.
As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of
seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred
without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything
we have got.

I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money  in South Af
rica  for fear of going through the same experience  in future since both
countries have similar political history. Moreover,the South  African
Foreign Exchange policy  does  not allow such investment as an  asylum
seeker. As a business man,whom I have entrusted my future and of my family
in his hands,I must let  you know that this transaction is risk free. If 
you accept to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the
money into any account you will nominate overseas.

This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you,
firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for
nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into
partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in
your country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I 
have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred
in the proccess of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the
money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country.
Contact me with the above telephone number while I implore you to maintain
the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level
of transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending a
reply.
Please, You should keep this transaction secret and confidential. And send
your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication.

N/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following:
1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.
2) YOUR FULL NAME.
3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.

THANKS FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION

I got your esteemed address from the internet during my search for a
reliable Individual/company who can jointly handle strictly confidential
transaction with me which involves a reasonable sum of money.

Due to the nature of this business transaction, a neutral person like you is
preferred. For introductory purpose, I am JAMES Momodu Pujeh, The son of
Momdu Pujeh, former transport and communications minister in Sierra Leone
who has been recently convicted for two years for illegally possessing
638.81 carats of diamonds valued at $36,500.

My father was sacked in November 2001 after the Anti-Corruption Commission
alleged that he and my mother had been involved in diamond trafficking in
Kenema, in the eastern part of Sierra Leone. My father won a seat in
parliamentary elections held last year but is expected to resign following
his conviction. My mother, Mary Momodu, is under investigation on a similar charges.

You may have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in Switzerland and
North America has been frozen. Following the outlined reasons for
investigation, I am soliciting for your esteemed organization's confidential
assistance to take custody of Thirteen Million, five hundred thousand United
States Dollars (US$13,500,000.00) and also to front for my family in the
areas of business you consider profitable.

These Consignments containing the funds have secretly been concealed and
deposited with a Diplomatic Security firm where it can easily be taken
delivery of by a recommended beneficiary. The consignment containing the
funds will be released to your
organization by the Security firm based on my recommendations on that note;
you will be presented as our partner who will be fronting for me and my
family in any subsequent ventures.

I have made my first visit to the security company and the document entitled
to clear this money is with a finance security company in Holland. On our
arrival in the Netherlands few weeks ago, we sought for political asylum;
which was granted.

Already, my sister and I are making frantic effort on the best way to handle
this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised that we must seek
for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a
profitable venture.

This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit
us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance and hope you
could be trusted.
Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through
your account. I and my mother have decided to give 25% to your organization
if you are able to help us claim this consignment. And 5% will be use for
upsetting all the expenses incurred in the course of concluding this venture
and the remaining 70% that will be for me and my family.

Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this
business ventures, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly
required, due to my family's present predicament. Also you stand to gain
from any investment you might introduce us into after the conclusion of the
transfer. Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money
into your account for security reasons.

I am presently in the refugee camp here in the Netherlands under the United
Nations and I can be reached by responding to the following email address:

immense benefit.

I am the only son of Dr Fedel C.Mumbaza from Sierra Leone. I am 22 years
old. My late father, Dr Fedel C.Mumbaza was a native of Mende district in
the Northern province of Sierra Leone, he was the ex-general Manager of
Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown.

He died as a result of a car accident ,(may his soul rest in peace) but
before he died ,He disclosed to me and my brother that he deposited the
sum of ( $13.4,000 000.00)thirteen Million Four Hundred Thousand United
State Dollars in a private security company in Ivory coast, that the money
was meant for the Cocoa export-business he wanted to establish
in Abidjan,Ivory coast.

Although according to my father he deposited the money in a private
security company, but he decleard it as Artcraft/Family valuables, He
gave us the documents for the claims,
(1)deposit certificates (2)Reciepts of payments,(3)Agreement papers.and

ask us to look for investors that will stand as his foreign business
partner.

I have arrived in Abidjan (Ivory coast) located the security company
and comfirmed the (safe) metallic trunk box.

Now with most honest and confidentiality I are soliciting your
assistance in the following ways:

(1)To stand as the foreign business partner of my late father(business
assocate) so that we can retrieve the box (safe)from the security.

(3) To move the money to your country for further investment.

Feel free, if you may have any questions to ask. Meanwhile I will offer
you 10% of the total sum .



Thank you and May Almigty God bless you for your kind assistance.

Micheal Mumbaza

Engr. Moel Kobo <engrmoelkobo@virgilio.it>,,"Mon, 30 Jan 2006 13:10:02 +0100",I need Your Assistant,"Dear Friend,
 
I know this mail may come as a surprise to you, since we 
do not know ourselves or have any previous contact before now, my 
purpose of writing you is this.
 
We believe that you would be in a 
position to help us in our bid to transfer the sum of twenty-seven 
million five hundred thousand dollars ($27.5m) into a foreign account.
 
We are members of a special committee for budget and planning of the 
ministry of petroleum, this committee is principally concerned with 
contract appraisals and approvals in order of priorities as regards 
capital project of the federal government. With our positions, we have 
successfully secured for ourselves the sum of twenty-seven million five 
hundred thousand united states dollars ($27.5m). 
The present 
government in my country are seeking the support of foreign 
governments, so they gave directive to all federal parastatals to 
compile and settle all foreign contractors being owned for contract 
that has been executed, so our plan is to include the name that you 
will provide us, as one of the contractors being owed in my 
corporation, the Nigerian national petroleum corporation (NNPC). 
What 
we need from you is (1) a company name or a name of which to use as the 
company that did execute the contract (2) an account even if empty into 
which the fund will be transferred, this is because our code of conduct 
prohibits government officials from operation or owning foreign 
account. 
It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be 
compensated with US$8.3million of the remitted funds; we will keep 
US$16.5million, while US$2.7million has been set aside to offset 
expenses and pay the necessary taxes. It may also interest you to know 
that two years ago similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. 
George Brooks of (BROGE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION) at number 
135, East 57th street, 28th Floor, New York 10022 with telephone (212) 
308-7788 and telex number 6731689, after the agreement between both 
partners in which he was to take 25% of the remitted fund (fifteen 
million united state dollars $15.000.000.) was duly transferred into 
his account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New York as we 
were told that Mr. Brooks was no longer on that address, while his 
telephone number had been re-allocated to somebody else, that was how 
we lost our money to Mr. Brooks. 
This time around we need a more 
reliable and trusted person or a reputed company to transact this 
project with hence this proposal to you, so if you can prove yourself 
to be trustworthy ready to partake in this project then we are prepare 
to do business with you. 
What we need from you is the assurance that 
you will let us have our share after the transfer of the fund ($27.5
million) into your account. 
If this proposal satisfies you,we can 
advice you on modalities of the transaction, and note that all 
modalities has been worked out and once started will take less than two 
weeks with the absolute support of all concerned. 
Note that this 
transaction is 100% risk free and totally safe now or after the fund 
transfer to your account. I will also like you to forward to me your 
telephone number for easy communication. Please treat as urgent and 
confidential as I look forward to your reply.

Karachi,pakistan



Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Mr Mr Zakir Mahmood official of Soneri Bank Limited .This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition.

On June 6, 2000,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the pakistan 
Asian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.kassim Hassan made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00,(Twenty-six Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address,but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the National Petroleum Corporation that  Mr.kassim Hassan died from an automobile accident.On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that   Mr.kassim Hassan
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official 
documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safe keeping.

No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to Asian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, 
the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to 
stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account.

I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds.

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for

me and 20% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our 
communication can only be via email and fax mostly.



Thanks and my regards.

Zakir Mahmood

Please reply to;  alfred_douglas1@yahoo.fr

My dear, 

Good day and God bless you. It is with deep sence of commitment, faith and
trust that I make this confidential risk free business proposal to you for
your assistance/partnership. I am deeply sorry if I have in any manner disturbe
your privacy. 

I am Mr. Alfred Douglas the head of the Audit Department of Continental
Bank in Cotounu Benin Republic. Recently, I discovered a domant account
with a huge amount of money valued at USD15.500,000.00 (fifteen million
,five hundred thousand US dollars) that belongs to one of our numerouse
customers MR.PIERE JOHNSON from Germany who died in a ghastly motor accident
in Cotounu on 5th OF May 2000. During the period of my investigation I discovered
that the deceased left no will and nobody behind to come for the claim as
his beneficiary. Since then several inquiries to locate any of MR. PIERE
JOHNSON extended relatives have proved unsuccessful, hence I decided to
contact you since the banking law here stipulates that if such money remain
unclaimed for a period of time, it will be forfieted to the gorvernment
treasury as an unclaimed fund which will be expended on acquiring dangeriouse
weaponse for the support of their selfish political interest and promoting
wars and ethnic crises in Africa. I  have decided to contact you to assist
me to pull out this fund from this bank as the business partner of MR. PIERE
JOHNSON for the claim of the fund. I want to also bring to your notice that
as the Head of the Audit department of this bank if this fund is not pulled
out before our auditing the fund fund will be discovered by my colleagues
and that will definately lead to the government confiscating the money into
the federation account. 

You might ask what will be the proceedure to achieve this. As soon as I
get your positive response to assist me, I will then send to you the proceedure
and the next step to follow. So if this meets your interest then get back
to me to enable me send to you the procedure of claiming this fund. I have
in my possetion all the necessary information of the deceased (MR. PIERE
JOHNSON) that will help us successfully accomplish this transaction. You
shall be offered 30% for your assistance, while 5% shall be set aside for
any expences that we might incure during the transaction.

Futher response shall be giving to you as soon as I recieve your positive
response. Fell free to call me on my private number (229) 28 30 63 for any
question you may wish to ask me.

{HIGHLY 
CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND
FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS)
RE: TRANSFER OF 36,759,000.00 
MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR
ACCOUNT.
My name is Mr.Jason Leicester and I 
work in the International Operation
Department in a Bank here in London.
I feel quite safe dealing with you
in this important business.Though, 
this medium (Internet) has been
greatly abused, I choose to reach you 
through it because it still
remains the fastest medium of 
communication. However, this
correspondence is unofficial and private, 
and it should be treated as
such. 

At first I will like to assure you 
that this transaction is 100% risk
and trouble free to both parties. WE 
WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM
OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR 
TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE
OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, 
a program leader.Until his
death,The Late Prime
Minister, Mr. Rafik 
Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United
Kingdom and all over 
the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum
of(THIRTY SIX MILLION 
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS
STERLINGS) in his account 
here in London which he deposited as a
family valuables.The family do 
not know about this deposit.I was on a
routine inspection that I 
discovered a dormant domiciliary account
with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX 
MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE
THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on 
further discreet investigation, I also
discovered that the account 
holder has passed away (dead) leaving no
beneficiary to the account. 
The bank will approve this money to any
foreigner because the former 
operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am
certainly sure that nobody 
will come again for the claim of this
money. A foreigner can only claim 
this money with legal claims to the
account Holder, 

Therefore I need 
your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide
all necessary 
information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping
in God that you 
will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik
Bahaa Edine Hariri 
(November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to
Nazek Audi Hariri, 
was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business
tycoon, and was five 
times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and
2000-2004) before his 
last resignation from office on October 20,
2004. The late Rafik Hariri 
died on February 14, 2005 when explosives
equivalent to around 300 kg 
of C4 were detonated as his motorcade
drove past the Saint George Hotel 
in the Lebanese capital, for more
information please log on to (http:

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I
DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW 
THAT THIS
MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW 
OURSELVES
BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I

YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES

With all sincerity and humility it is with deep pains i write you this
message of wishful assistance to my predicament. I am Mrs Jewel Taylor
the estranged wife to the former president of Liberia who was asked by
unanimous decision by the international community to step down from the
corridors of power .

I write you this mail under duress and as a result of my recent
decision to better the lives of i and my children. I have made a
decision which i know might not be good in the sight of man but the
present situation has led me to this decision to better the lives of my

(Twenty Million United States Dollars)belonging to my husband in which
i am a benefiaciary to, i have decided to relocate with your
assistance to your private account the said sum.

My decision was reached when i could not conceive the thought that
after the United States Government has promised to let my husband go
free based on the condition that he should step down Mr. Collin Powell
stated in a press briefing that he would be indicted by the court in
Netherlands to face charges on war crimes, this is what led to my
decision as God Knows that i was never in support of his involvement in
the indecent maltreating of innocent people in Politics.

This decision is hard for me to make but i just have to make it for the
sake of my children's future.

Currently the said sum was lodged in a safety deposit box in a
financial Institution which i will disclose to you as a matter of
commitment to me and this plea for assistance. I currently have the
deposit certificate and can draw up a change of beneficiary mandate to
effect you as the beneficiary to the funds. I am a trained economist by
profession and it is in this line that i will want you to take note
that your services for assisting me will be compensated to the best of
my ability.

I have this to look forward to so i would like you to keep this
project close to your heart just as myself pending when we reach the
conclusive end of this project. I will want you as a matter of
confidentiality to respond through this mail and also include your
telephone number as well so that i can give you a call if the need
arises as we are currently on political asylum now in west africa. Once

Mattew Molefe <mattewmolefe6@yehey.com>,R@S,"Wed, 04 Aug 2004 09:00:27 -0700",open door,"Dear Sir,

I want to ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am MR.MATTEW MOLEFE, the Auditor General in National Credit Bank (NCB) of South Africa, during the course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1993 and since 1999 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Jurgen T.Dormann, a foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1999. And no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Jurgen T.Dormann until his death was the Coy. (pty). SA. 

We will start the first transfer with Twenty four million [$24,000.000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount of ($ 40,000.000.00 USD) to your account.

The amount involved is ($64,000.000.00 USD) Sixty four million United States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $24,000.000.00 [twenty four million United States Dollar ]from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.Jurgen T.Dormann is a foreigner too, and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got your contact address from South Africa chamber of commerce, I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. Because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the total amount, 55% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply to phone and fax number below or [mattewmolefe1@yada-yada.com]

Mercy Kume <mercykume121@netzero.com>,R@M,"Tue, 13 Apr 2004 13:50:38 +0100",Confidential,"Dear Friend

I am Mrs.Mercy Kume, wife of late Mr Anthony Kume, a wealthy Zimbabwean 
farmer who was brutally murdered in a land dispute together with his 
oversea 
partner Mr. pete Bailey and the whole of his family as result of land 
act 
reform by Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. The whole of  our 
farmland amd 
properties were destroyed by the mobs. The new land act reform which 
affected the white and black farmers, resulting to massive killing by 
war 
veterans and lunatics in the society.

My husband died without leaving a word neither to me nor our only son, 
but 
his partner was rushed to the hospital where he later died after 2 
days. 
Before my husband partner died, he confided in me that he deposited 
US$29,000,000 (Twenty Nine million united states dollars) in one 
private 
security company in Europe, that the money was meant for the purchase 
of new 
machineries for mechanised agriculture for the Zimbabwean farmers 
movement 
and new farms in Swaziland. He said that all I have to do is to source 
for 
an oversea partner who can be placed as the Beneficiary of the fund so 
that 
I and my son can have a new lease of life again. He made me promise 
that 
since he has no other leaving relatives, that I will not let money go 
down 
the drain.

I was later diagnosed to have cancer of the breast which resulted to my 
losing one part of the breast to surgery. Presently, I am hospitalised 
because my condition started deteriorating in a very strange manner. My 
doctor gave me the saddest news of life as he told me that the cancer 
has 
spread to every part of my body including my liver. I have been boldly 
told 
that I just have a very short time to leave. As things are now, I am 
not 
afraid to die, but I don??t want my son to suffer and I don??t want to 
let 
late Mr.Bailey down by not having this claimed.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to 
stand in 
as the next of kin to Late Mr. Pete Bailey .This you can do by 
corroborating 
with my Kenneth who is currently seeking political asylum in Europe, 
and our 
family attorney to actualise this claim. I will request that you send 
me 
your personal details viz: Your full name and private home address, 
your 
telephone and fax number.this will enable the attorney to place you as 
the 
next of kin to late Mr.Pete Bailey.The sharing mode will be as follows.

1.30% of the fund will be for you

2.50% will be for my son which you will have to invest for him as his 
guadian.

3.10% will be donated to the Southern African research center for 
cancer.

4.While 10% will be set out for all the bills encured to conclude this 
transaction including the attorney fees.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will 
be 
done by the Attorney and with my support and endorsement I can 
guarantee the 
successful execution of this transaction. I cannot answer to any phone 
calls 
here in the hospital because of my situation.So if you are interested 
in 
this transaction, kindly declare your interest by replying to this  
e-mail 
via my private mail mercykume@netscape.net

your favourable reply , I will proceed to forward you with further 
information.

KENNETH OBI <kennethobia5@hotmail.com>,,"Wed, 12 Sep 2007 18:39:27 -0600",Attention please,"Attention please
Compliments to you; I sincerely apologize for the intrude into your private life, however I have a serious project which I believe would be of interest to you and for this reason I reached out to you. I am Barrister Kenneth Obi. I worked as an attorney to an Oil Servicing company {CEDRY INCORPORATED} from 1980 to 1996 when the company liquidated. Cedry liquidated and folded as a result of mismanagement and feud amongst the directors. On the 11th of June 1986, the company secretary and I took a LIFE ASSURANCE POLICY for the Chairman of the company for a period of TWENTY YEARS, which is from June 1986 till June 2006. This LIFE POLICY was taken from a reputable Insurance Company here called STANDARD TRUST INSURANCE PLC. The premium for this Life policy was paid upfront by the Cedry because it is a long-term policy.
In 1996, Cedry was folded but Standard Trust Insurance Company did not terminate the Life Policy we took for the Chairman because we did not apply  for cancellation or termination of the Policy. On December 2006, I got a letter from Standard Trust Insurance notifying me that the LIFE POLICY we took for Cedry Chairman was due and that I should come to their office for further discussions. I went to their office and they told me that they have Three Million Dollars accrued over a period of twenty years to pay to the Chairman of liquidated Cedry as SURRENDER VALUE for the Life Policy the company took for him. The Insurance Company knew that Cedry was folded and they asked me to provide the Chairman or his relative to receive the money.
Since 2006 till date I have searched for the Chairman without success. I went back to tell the Insurance Company that the Chairman is very old and senile to the extent that his sight is very bad and that he cannot do anything for himself as he is almost a vegetable. The Insurance Company told me to get any of  the Chairman’s relative with his authorization to claim the surrender value for him. I have resolved to get any person or any person bearing same name as the Chairman to stand as his relative to receive the surrender value. If we don't claim this money,  no one would and the money would be retained in the coffers of the Insurance Company as their profit. I feel it is rather appropriate that we team up and claim this money and use some percentage of it to help the poor and the less privilege in our society than allow the Insurance Company to retain it as profit.
I contacted you in trust believing that you will not run away with the money if it enters your account. The Insurance Company have very high respect and regards for me and will be obliged to released the Surrender Value to whoever I present to them as heir to the Chairman. I will obtain for you all that is required to execute this transaction successfully. I have in my file some documents for the existence of the Cedry and the Life Policy. I will send to you once you indicate your interest. I will also send a claim application specimen to you, which you will fill and send to the Insurance Company for the release of the surrender value to your account. Your share for assisting in this transaction will be One Million Dollars. If you cannot execute this transaction for any reason, please introduce someone who is capable and I will reward you with Fifty thousand dollars after the transaction. Reply urgently if you are interested to execute this with me. Regards,Barrister Kenneth Obi

Dear Sir/Madam


SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. 

The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. 

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.

Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. 

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and God Bless. 
Best Regards

in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder
and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. james  smith on 1 February 1997

died in a plane crash on air senegal on aircraft Name Hawker Siddeley HS-748.
This crash happened in Tambacoumba, Senegal, Africa and the
registration

number of the aircraft is 6AV-AEO, and since his untimely death the
funds has been dormant in his account with my Bank without any claim of the
fund On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a
WILL, and all
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. james smith
 did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank
Deposit paperwork in my Bank.
This sum of US$22,500,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my bank
to a security company for safe-keeping.No one will ever come forward to
claim it.
According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money
will revert to the
ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the
fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an
Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the late mr.james smith as to claim the money I deposited with the security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does
not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic
materials for export.

 am writing you because  as a public servant,
we can not operate a foreign account or have an account that is more
than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the
security company so you can be able to claim them with the
help of my attorney.All these are to make sure that the fruits of
this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt
government officials.

This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names
and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents
which will put you in place as the  owner of the boxes.
The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of
70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of
all expenses.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the
successful execution of this transaction.

if you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address/phone
upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe with utmost confidentiality,
and be rest assured that this transaction would be
most profitable for both of us because I shall require your
assistance to invest my share in your country.

REGARDS.

DR.TUNJI OWO.

GRAND FINANCE AND TRUST BANK.
RUE CLUB DE L' AMITIE,
0251 B.P. 1625 COTONOU,
BéNIN REPUBLIQUE.



My Dear Friend,

  In Oder to transfer to overseas $28.5 million(USD)
from GRAND FINANCE AND TRUST BANK,Bénin Republique.
I want to  ask you to quietly look for a reliable
and honest person who will be capable and fit to
provide either an existing bank account or to set up a
new  Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even
an empty a/c can serve to receive this funds quitely.

I am Mr.Daniel Mensah, the accountant/auditor of
the above Finance Corporation in Cotonou,Bénin
Republique and personal confidant to Mr.Alvaro Quesada
of Dominican Republic in Caribbean Island who died in
a Plane Crash accident(2002-04-19) on his way to
attend a weddind ceremony together with his wife and
only Child (Alvaro Jr).

Mr.Alvaro Quesada, is From Dominican Republic in
Caribbean Island, and a prosperous Tobacco merchant,
he died in the year 2002 without having any
beneficiary to his assets including his account
here in Bénin which he opened in the above stated bank
in the year 2001 as his personal savings for the
purpose of expansion and developement of his company
in Africa before his untimely death in 2002.Until his
death,he was the president of the Dominican Tobacco
Exporters Association.

And from my Investigation,i found out that No other
person knows about this account because he( Mr.Alvaro
Quesada )never knew that he is going to die so soon,
and so his purpose was not achieved. If i don't remit
this money immediately, it will get lost(may be it
will go into the pockets of the corrupt government
officials who will never use it for any reasonable
thing at all).I dont want to miss this opportunity
because it comes ones in a life time.

The amount involved is $28.5 million(USD)Twenty eight
million,five hundred United States Dollars and no
other person knows about this account. I am contacting
you for us to transfer this funds to your account as
the beneficiary,I want to first transfer
$16,000.000.00(Sixteen million USD) from this money
into a safe account abroad, after which we will
transfer the remaining (12.5M).  I am only contacting
you as a foreigner because this money cannot be
approved to a local person here, without a valid
foreign international  passport, but can only be
approved to any foreigner with valid international
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c, this is
because the money is in US Dollars and the former
owner of the a/c, Alvaro Quesada is a foreigner too,
and as such the money can only be approved into a
foreign a/c.

However,  I am revealing this to you with belief in
God that you will never let me down in this business.I
don't know you and have never seen you before,i only
got your contacts from an international directory
which my secretary provided for me. You are the first
and the only person that I am contacting for this
business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take. Send also your
private telephone and fax number.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account,which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a keybank
official who is deeply involved with me in this
business.
I want to tell you that this transaction is 100% risk
free and legal because all the documents that will
back up this transaction will be available, so that no
body will question the fund when it is finaly
tranfered to your account.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
40% of the total amount and 60% will be for me. I look
forward to your earliest reply through this email.


Thanks for your time.

Your's faithfully,

Mr.Daniel Mensah

products distribution and subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million. 

2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in 
the country~ US$ 152Million. 

3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 
Million. The original values of this contract were deliberately over invoiced 
to the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been approved and 
is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed 
these contracts has been fully paid and project officially commissioned. 
consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to

you to draw up an investment plan for us of which you will control since we 
cannot bring our shares back to Nigeria. We are very interested in investing in 
real estate in your country. You must however note that this transaction is

as the bonafide beneficiary. Also, be informed that our main reason of 
contacting you is for the obvious reason that we will want to invest these

Ata Yusuf <atayusuf@parsnet-co.com>,R@M,"Thu, 31 Mar 2005 04:13:04 +0100","Message from Ata, pls give me a hand.","Dear Friend,
I am Ata Yusuf 24 years of age, from Darfur, Sudan, the only surviving Son of the family of Ibrahim Yusuf who was a civil engineer before his death in May 21, 2004 as a result of the crisis in Darfur, Western Sudan. You can read more about the crisis in Dafur, Sudan by click on this weblink; http://www.savedarfur.org/. This unforgettable incident claimed the lives of my parents while my sisters and I were in school, as such we have been in a refugee camp since the death of our parents before a kind hearted woman took me to London, Uk where I have currently seek asylum. As such I am in great need of help now because I need to move my sisters out of the refugee camp back home in Sudan, to settle down with me here in London. 

I am writing you now because I need you to help me claim the funds my father deposited in a security and finance company in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He deposited the sum of $3.8million us dollars (three million and eight hundred thousand united states dollars) in this security and finance company which I discovered shortly before leaving my country for Uk. I have the relevant document that will be require for the claim of the funds but my problem now is that I am not in the position to handle such huge amount of money here because of my immigration status. It might interest you to know that I have already establish communication with the security company to claim the funds as the heir of my family, unfortunately that is just all I can do by myself for now. As a result, In a nut shell i need you to help me remit the funds from the security company on my behalf, I am sure it will not take too much of your time because I have everything that will facilitate the quick release of the funds to you.

I am counting on you to help me in most sincerity and not to take undue advantage of my present situation as I will be basically entrusting you with these funds. Once you get the funds, you have to send me some money that will be enough for my sisters to arrange for their traveling documents to come over to London to join me. 

Finally, I will need you to invest the rest funds in a profitable partnership business venture in your country, we will discuss our partnership terms when we arrange to meet after the completion of this transfer.

I hope to hear from you soon, my regards to your family.

Best Regards,
Ata Yusuf.

apprehensive and worried, but I assure you that all is well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the

start by first introducing myself properly. I am senior manager with the (S.S.B BANK Plc), Accra Ghana I came to
know of you in my private search for a reliable and a reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which involves
maximum confidence.

PROPOSITION: A foreigner, Late engineer Jacques Monroe, an oil merchant/contractor with the Government of Ghana, until his
death in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at S.S.B.BANK Plc Accra, and had a closing balance as at the end of march, 2002
worth USD$23.5 million (Twenty three million, Five Hundred Thousand United State dollars) Which the bank now expect a next 
of kin to claim as beneficiary. Valuable effort are being made by the BANK to get in touch with any of the Monroe`s family or relatives 
but there has been no success. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of the late Engr. Jacques Monroe 
next of kin (he had no children that is known to us.) The management under the influence of our chairman and member of the board of 
Director, that an arrangement has been made for the funds to be declared =93UNCLAIMABLE=94 and subsequently be donated to the 
Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general while people are suffering. 
There are no good schools, no clean water and no good hospitals etc.. In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted 
colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the late Engr Jacques Monroe so that the funds USD$23.5million 
would be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin. All document and proves to enable you get this fund will be 
carefully worked out by me .

My colleagues and I want to use 70% of our share in this money for charity. Building good hospital and schools to help the less
priviledged ones. If you are interested you are to be the contarctor to supervise this money to make sure it is being used for 
what it is meant for. If you are not interested, it is not a must but it is only I believe you would do it better that is why I contacted.

We are going to give you 20% of the total fund for securing the money. Even the money in question is already in Europe of which if 
you are interested, we would direct you to whom you are to contact and the code which you would present and that would confirm 
you the bonafide owner of this fund.

transfer of the funds in your favor.

Thanks in advance for your anticipated cooperation.

ATTENTION:C.E.O 

I am lady Maryam Abacha, wife of the late General Sani 
Abacha,ex-military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who 
died on the 8th of June 1998 of heart problems.

I contacted you because of my need to deal with person/persons who my 
family and I have had no previous personal relationship with. 

An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death 
of my husband, my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment 
and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the 
government and the press about my husband. 

The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are 
frozen and all assests siezed. 

It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in 
the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my 
family fund in my possession and control. 

The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all 
our accounts both local and international, but my only hope now is the 
available US$100Million cash, which I carefully packaged and deposited 
with a security finance company in Holland.

My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the 
funds, will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time

Please permit me to contact you through this medium. My name is 
Dr.Hilary Colsman, solicitor to the great Yengeni family in South Africa.
Recently, my client's wife Mrs. Susan Yengeni took my attention to the 
wide use of her husband's name by some impersonators/Scam artist to defraud 
foreigners, claiming to be related to the family. Incase you had received such 
email before now, from anyone else, please ignore the email and desist from 
it now. She also revealed to me about her husband's funds that is been 
deposited in a bank in my country.
For your information: Her husband, Mr. Tony Yengeni was arrested and 
charged to court for a multibillion dollar arms deal fraud, which was 
politically motivated by his enemies as her husband was the chairman of parliament 
in South Africa and the former chief whip of the ruling political party. 
We had pleaded guilty in exchange for his acquittal on corruption charges 
but were later convicted on trumped-up charges. This led to his bank 
accounts in my bank and abroad being frozen.
Now, as a matter of urgency, we need your assistance in the remittance 
of the discovered funds abroad. The funds are currently deposited with a 
bank in South Africa, which I will disclose to you upon my receipt of your 
favorable response and consent in this deal.
The amount is US$22.5 Million United States Dollars, which was deposited 
by Mr. Tony Yengeni before his arrest. At the moment, the account is on 
Dormancy, because no one has been operating the said account since his arrest. 
All the account details and documents where also brought to me by his wife. 
I hope you understand.
You can find more about her husband?s predicaments at the following 
websites:

http://www.ifp.org.za/Releases/190303apr.htm

Let me assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free. From my 
discussion with her, she has agreed to give you a reasonable percentage of the 
money for your assistance, which will be negotiated and agreed on by both 
sides. I am obliged to assist this lady knowing that she has a limited 
knowledge in the business world. 
I will need from you a mutual understanding and then we shall make plans 
of how the funds would be secured into an account in your name.
More so, Thanks and God bless you for your understanding. Please do not 
forget to email me your private telephone number so that I can give you a call 
to discuss this matter if you are interested in this proposal.
Awaiting your reply via email.

Director, Investments and Portfolio Management,
Royal Accounting and Trust LLC,
Switzerland.
Tel: 41 79 530 99 35
 
 
Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland.
 
I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction, which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field).
 
All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now 
decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased.
 
The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside 
marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharjs property for her 
and her son.
 
You must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing 
you as the only beneficiary.
 
The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not 
permanently resident in Switzerland.
 
For your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank 
funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are 
concerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child.
 
If you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will 
proceed.
 
I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at www.royaltrust.com.
 
We await your timely response.
 
Best Regards

  {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
{ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00USD) One hundred and Twenty 
six million United States Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you 
to quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set 
up a new  Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can 
serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till 
the end for this important business trusting in you and believing  in God 
that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr.Eze Ekeyion, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during the 
course of our auditing  I discovered a floating fund  in an account opened 
in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account 
again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that 
the owner of the account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is 
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner of this account is  Mr. 
Phillip Morris, a foreigner, and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993, and  
no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the 
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager Morris & Morris 
Coy.(pty). SA.


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six million [$26,000.000] upon 
successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall 
re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and Twenty Six million United 
States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six 
million United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I 
am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved 
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid 
international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money 
is in US Dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip Morris is a 
foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got your 
contact address  from the Girl who operates computer, I am revealing this to 
you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, 
you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this 
business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step 
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including 
the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding 
agreement that will  bind us together  before transferring the money to any 
account of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to your 
country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine, because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive 
response and once I am convinced that you are  capable  and will meet up 
with instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in 
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this 
money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of 
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place 
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to discuss with me face 
to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three 
of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going 
into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that 
you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my 
position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from  the 
relevant  ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total 
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.

You should try to call me on my satelite phone no. 882-1646685262. if you 
are calling my No. dial the way you use to call other countries, do not put 
South African area code, because it is a satellite phone.

Dear Sir,
I am Dr (Mrs)Maryam Abacha, wife to the late Nigeria
Head of state, General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th
of june 1998 while still on active duty . I am
contacting you in view of the fact we will be of great assistance to each
other, likewise developing acordial business relationship. I currently have
within my reach the sum of Thirty Million United States Dollars
($30,000,000.00) cash, which I intend to use for investment purposes
specifically in your country.
This money came as a result of a pay-back
contract deal between my late husband and a Russian firm in our country's
Multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant. The Russian firm in our country's
Multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The Russian partners returned my
Husband's share of US$30,000,000.00 U.S.D after his death, and lodged it in
my late husband's Security Company of which I am a Director Right now, the
new Civilian Government has intensified their probe on my late husband's
financial resources and have frozen our accounts. In view of these facts, I
acted fast to withdraw the US$30,000,000.00 U.S.D from the company's vault
and deposited it in a privately owned security safe in . I have
since declared the security company bankrupt.

No record whatsoever exists concerning the money traceable by the Government because, there is no
documentation showing that we received the money from the Russians. Due to
the current situation in the country concerning the Government's attitude
towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this
money within; thus upon your consent, I shall expect you to contact me
urgently to enable us discuss indetail about this transaction. Bearing in
mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a
commission of 20% (Twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected
services and assistance. Your urgent response is highly needed so as to stop
further contact.

All correspondence must be by
e-mail. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extraordinary confidential, whatever your
decision, while I await your prompt response.

Salutation,c'est avec respect et humilité que je vous j'écris pour solliciter de votre haute bienveillance, une assistance de grande importance.Je souhaite solliciter votre aide dans la migration et l'investissement dans votre pays  la fortune que j'ai hertitée de mon père . Brièvement, je suis une sierra léonaise agée de 22 ans et la fille unique du défunt DR Kouakou Bah Theodore. Jusqu'à sa mort, mon père était le Directeur général d'une société d'extraction d'or et de diamant dans la région de Kanema en Sierra Leone. Le 6 Avril 2002 les forces militaires fidèles au gouvernement d'Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH ont envahi la mine de diamant et d'or et ont assassiné mon père, le confondant avec son frère kouakou Sankoh qui est le député du (RUF) du révolutionnaire FODAY SANKOH.Quand ma mère, absente car venu me voir en côte d'ivoire où j'étudie dans une grande école a appris la nouvelle ,elle est retounée au pays malgré tous les risques et a récupéré certaines des affaires qu'elle jugeait sacrées pour mon père dans notre villa de famille. Parmi les objets récupérés figurait un dossier contenant des détails d'un dépôt que mon père a fait dans une société de compagnie de sécurité à Abidjan Côte d'Ivoire. Il y a déposé $ 10.500.000,00 (Dix millions cinq cent mille de dollars des États-Unis) contenus dans une (1) boîte de tronc à son nom. Il n'a pas révélé le vrai contenu de la boîte à cette société. Néanmoins il  a déclaré le dépôt comme biens de famille pour des raisons de sécurité. C'est l'argent que mon defunt père a gagné à partir de la vente de l'or et de diamants pendant son temps comme Directeur général. Compte tenu du climat politique instable en Cote d´Ivoire , j'ai décidé de chercher un partenaire afin d'investir cette somme hors de la Côte D'ivoire dans des domaines rentables,  c'est donc la raison pour laquelle je viens vers vous pour solliciter votre assistance et nous aider à investir dans votre pays. La meilleure méthode pour conclure cette transaction vue la tension politique en cote d´Ivoire, serait d'expédier la caisse contenant les fonds dans votre pays . La compagnie de sécurité a la possibilité de nous faciliter les choses en expédiant cette caisse dans votre pays par la voie diplomatique que j'apprécie beaucoup. Dès l'arrivée de ces fonds dans votre pays, vous allez les récupérer et les sauvegarder et engager les démarches pour nous aider à venir s'établir dansvotre pays. Ici en raison de sa proximité à notre pays et de la guerre, notrestatut de réfugié ici ne peut pas faciliter les affaires pour nous. Nous vous demandons également de rechercher des affaires fiables et lucratives, de sorte que nous puissions investir sagement. Nous avons à l'esprit de vous donner 15 % de toute la somme (10.500.000,00 millions de dollars $), et la part de 25% dans n'importe quel investissement que nous ferons au moment venu si vous acceptez de nous aider.  Cette fortune que nous vous avons indiquée devrait demeurer confidentielle.dans l'attente de vous lire.Au plaisir de collaborer avec vous. Bien à vous, Mlle  kouakou Chantal

Mustapha Momodu <mustapha_stb@zwallet.com>,sigmod-pods06-webmaster@UM,"Tue, 07 Mar 2006 10:09:24 -0800",GOOD DAY,"Dear Sir/Madam
Compliment of the day to you .
I got your contact through a friend, who attended a programme in 2005,S.P.E.
Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, in searching for a reliable and
trust worthy person to handle risk free transaction.He recommended you to me.

I am Mr.Mustapha Momodu, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch
. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th
2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek
made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at
TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my
branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply.
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next
of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.
This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. 
No one will come forward to claim it.
According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,
the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies
to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to
assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael
creek,
 so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the
hands of some corrupt officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full
names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall
employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration
in your favor for the transfer.
A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%
for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous
expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary
paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding.
Best Regards.

Bonjour , 

Respectueusement veuillez m'excuser je n'ai pas le choix,
permettez moi de vous informer de ce problème qui me pousse
à vous expedier ce message.Jai obtenu vos coordonnés sur
Internet,je me suis permis de vous envoyer ce message car
les informations sur vous me mette en confiance,vous êtes
une personnalité honorable et digne de confiance.
A cet effet, je nai pas hésiter à me fier à vous pour mon
problème qui concerne ma famille et moi.Je vous contacte en
ce jour en espérant que cela conduira à une occasion
d'affaire basée sur l'honnêteté et la transparence.

Je suis THOMSON Stella la seule fille de 'ancien
chef THOMSON ROBERT de la SIERA LEONNE. La source de votre
contact me donne le courage et la confiance de me
confier à vous. Je vous écris avec une confidence
absolue premièrement pour demander votre assistance
pour transférer notre liquidité de 20 000 000 million
de dollar qui actuellement se trouve dans le coffre
fort d'une compagnie de sécurité ici en Abidjan dans
votre compte personnel jusqu'à notre arrivée dans
votre pays. 

           SOURCE DE L'ARGENT

Mon défunt père, chef THOMSON , le patron des 
extracteur d'or et de diamant en Sierra Leone (S.L.M.C)
Freetown.
Concernant mon père, cet argent est le résultat de
l'or et le diamant extraient des mines Sierra
Léonaise avant le début de la guerre civil entre les
forces rebelles et les forces de maintien de la paix
de l'ECOMOG qui a détruit mon pays après le coup de
force qui a chassé du pouvoir, le président
démocratiquement élu AHMED TEJAN KABBAH. 
Mon père avait déjà mis en place un plan pour nous
évacuer (ma famille) ma mère, mon petite frère et moi même
sur Abidjan en Cote d'ivoire avec nos effets personnels et
la boite contenant l'argent par le biais des forces
d'évacuation des nations unies. Mon père nous a demandé de
déposer la boite dans une compagnie privée de sécurité
jusqu'à ce qu'il nous rejoigne après la guerre. Pendant la
guerre dans mon pays, et avec pour conséquence le
pillage des propriétés publiques et du gouvernement
par les forces rebelles, la coopération des mines
sierra léonaise étaient l'une des cibles pillées et
détruites. Mon père et plusieurs autres haut
fonctionnaires ont été attaqués et tués par les
rebelles en novembre 2000 pour leur relation avec le
gouvernement civil d'AHMED TEJAN KABBAH. 
Suite à la mort de mon père, et avec les nouvelles de
mon oncle à propos de son accident d'avion en janvier,
nos espoirs de survie étaient complètement noyés.

Cette mort prématurée de mon père et de mon oncle a
provoqué un arrêt cardiaque chez ma mère et d'autres
complications qui ont provoqués sa mort plus tard dans un
hôpital et après on a eu à dépenser une importante somme
d'argent pour elle. Actuellement mon frère de 18 ans et moi
même sommes seuls dans ce pays étrange, souffrant et sans
aucun soutien . sans aucune relations, nous sommes
actuellement comme des réfugiés et des orphelins. Notre
seul espoir actuellement est en vous et en la boite qu'on
déposé dans la compagnie de sécurité. 
A cet effet, je sollicite humblement votre assistance
dans le sens suivant :

1- m'aider à faire sortir la boite de la compagnie de
sécurité comme CO- bénéficiaire pour transférer cet argent
en votre nom dans votre propre compte dans votre pays pour
un investissement lucratif .avec vous comme principal
acteur.
 
2- Le plus important c'est que la compagnie de
sécurité ne connaît pas le contenu exact de la boite 
parce qu'on l'a déclaré comme richesses familiales.

3- Tous les documents relatifs au dépôts sont dans
mon coffre a la maison.

4- Pour votre assistance, je vous céderai 20% de cet 
argent pour vos efforts et votre assistance.

5- Enfin je vous prie de garder cette transaction 
strictement confidentiel. 

Merci et que Dieu vous bénisse pour votre assistance à
notre égard. 

 
NB; excuse mais j'aimerai que vous ne contactez sur cette

MANAGING DIRECTOR.
 
Dear Sir,

I am Mr Musatapha Accounts supervisor with National Bank,Freetown, Sierra 
Leone. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On 
June 6, 1999, a Foreign Diamond consultant/contractor with the Sierra Leonean 
National Diamond Corporation, Mr.Simon Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) 
Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at SD$27,000,000.00, (Twenty-Seven 
Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to 
his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and 
finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Sierra Leanean National 
Diamond Corporation that Mr. Simon Kelly died from a rebel attack. On further 
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all 
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further 
investigation and discovered that Mr. Simon Kelly did not declare any kin or 
relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork 
in my Bank. This sum of USD$27,000,000.00 has carefully/confidentially been 
moved out of my bank to a Finance security company in the Gambia for 
safekeeping. No one can ever come forward to claim it. According to Sierra 
Leonean Law, at the expiration of 8 (eight) years,the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Sierra Leone Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 
Consequently, my proposal is that I want you as a Foreigner to stand in as the 
rightful owner of the money. I deposited it in a security company in two trunk 
boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I 
tagged them to be photographic materials for export. In the circumstance, I 
want to present you as the rightful owner of the boxes in the security company 
so that you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is 
simple. I would like you to provide immediately your full names and address as 
well as your direct telephone and fax number so that the Attorney will prepare 
the necessary documents which will put you in the right place as the owner of 
the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to your country and share in the 
ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you. There is no risk at all as all the 
paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will 
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction on your behalf, please 
reply immediately via my email address. Upon your response, I shall then 
provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you 
understand the transaction and swing into the necessary action while I confide 
in you hoping you will not betray me at last. 
Thanks and God bless 
 
Mr Musatapha

trapped here in Cote D Ivoire.In other to commence this Business, we solicit 
your assistance to enable us transfer into your Account the said trapped 
funds.
The source of this fund is as follows: During the last regime here of
General Robert Guei in Cote D Ivoire some government official's set up 
companies and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over Invoiced 
in various ministries. The government set up a contract review panel and we 
have Identified a lot of inflated
contracts funds which are presently Deposited in a BANK here in Abidjan,Cote 
D Ivoire .
However, by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of the 
panel ,we cannot acquire this money in our name. we have
therefore ,been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues  to look for 
an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer
the total sum of USD$15,500,000.00  (FIFTEEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
UNITED STATES DOLLARS)

 In order to transfer out (USD 126 M) One hundred and twenty six million United States Dollars) from African Development Bank. I have the courage to ask you to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important business believing that you will never let me down either now or in future. 

I am Mr. Errol Marshall, the Chief auditor of African Development Bank (ADB). There is an account opened in this bank in 1990 and since 1995 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr.Smith B.Andreas a foreigner, and a miner at kruger gold co,a geologist by profession and he died since 1994. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD $126M) One hundred and twenty six million United States Dollars. I want to first transfer US$26( twenty six million United States Dollars) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the account is Mr. Smith B.Andreas he is a foreigner too. I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we don't know ourselves before. We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business. I only got your contact address from my secretary who operates computer, with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business. You are the only person that I have contacted in this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. 

Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other investments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-peration to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner, who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you immediately, if you are able and with capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need truthful person in this business because I don't want to make mistake I need you strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place. You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. 

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.

Attention Please, I am Mr Mohamat Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you. I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication, Yours faithfully, Mr Mohamat Ali.

MRS. MARIAM ABACHA <abachafamily20052005@yahoo.com>,R@C,"Sat, 12 Jun 2004 03:05:52 +0100",PLEASE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN URGENTLT NEEDED,"Dear Sir,

It is with hope that I write to seek your help in the context below.
I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigerias former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998. Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.

The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that is so traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith. 

You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail. 

Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I came in contact with your name and address in a website and would want to have good confidence in you as I view you to be a responsible personality. 

I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody( for safety) the sum of $50 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands property is under the authority of the familys Lawyer (Attorney)Barrister MIKE AHAMBA(SAN).

The investigative teams set up by government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the $50m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family friend without delay, for security reasons. 

All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized. This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your goodself with 10% of the total deposit when you finally the deposit box from the security firm and lodged in your account. 

They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me,you can write me through my e-mail, please reply direct to this email address; dr_mrsabacha@sify.com  for obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you keep all our communication very secret. Donot mention my family""s name or disclose the transaction to anybody.

If you are not interested in assisting me, still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me.

Best Regards,
Hajia mariam Abacha

On the 18th day of March 2007, we were alerted on the presence of some 
terrorists hideouts in Haifa Street, a long thoroughfare of high-rise 
buildings built by Saddam Hussein here in Baghdad. 

After Immediate intervention by the Iraqi forces and ours, we were able  to 
capture many foreign Arab fighters linked to al Qaeda in that operation and 
over 100 militants were killed on the process. Among the  Arab fighters 
linked to al Qaeda two were interrogated by two of our  intelligent 
investigators and I. They confessed that some of them are  fighters for al 
Qaeda and some are for Ayman al-Zawahiri and they took us to  some of their 
hideout which runs along the west bank of the Tigris River  that cuts through 
the capital. 

When we invaded into the hideout, we recovered several guns, amour including 
some boxes among which two contains bullets, one filled with  hard  drugs 
(heroine) and the other two to my amazement contain some US Dollars 
which we assumed amounted to $23.2M after I and two of the  intelligent 
investigators counted them and it took us over 4 hours to get  it counted. 

I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have 
the money to our selves, they all agreed to the plan and they  replied to me 
on how I can get this huge sum out of this country and I  told them that 
ital&#8482;s no problem. 

This motivated me to connive with my best friend in our force who went with 
me and the two other officers to keep the boxes in a safer place. 

I am now in keen need of a ""Reliable and Trustworthy"" person like you who 
would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars for 
me  untill my assignment elapses here. 

I assure and promise to give you 20% of this fund, however feel free to 
negotiate what you wish to have as your percentage in this deal. 

Please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret to protect my job with 
the US Monitoring and Peace-Keeping mission. please you can  contact me with 
my private mailbox......  capt.james_brianusmarine5@yahoo.com 

My Sincere regards, 
Capt James Brian.(U.S MARINE)

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.
================================================================
Although this proposal might come to you as a surprise since it is coming from someone you do not know or everseen before, but after due deliberation with my colleagues,i decided to forward this business proposal to you we want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of fifty one million, five hundred thousand united states dollars (us$51.5 million) into his/her account. 
   
   
  This fund resulted from an over invoiced bill from a contract awarded by us for the turn around maintenance (t.a.m) carried out on the four refineries in nigeria during the last military regime of general abdulsalami abubakar. 
   
   
  We awarded this contract under the budget allocation to my parastatal, the bill was approved for payment and the contract has been executed and the original contractor was paid his actual cost of this contract we are left with the balance of us$51.5 million dollars as the over invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our own use, but under our protocol division,civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign account. This is why i am contacting you for assistance. 
We have agreed to share the money as follows. 
(1) 30% for you the account owner 
(2) 60% for us (the officials) 
(3) 10% to be used in settling taxation and all local / foreign expenses.
   
  I am the executive chairman of the contract award committee of the department of petroleum resources this transaction is very much free from all sort of risk because this business was carefully planned before it was successfully executed and we the officials involved in this deal have in many years of meritorious services to our parastal.

To get this fund into your account, we have to present an international business outfit and consequent upon indication of your interest to fully assist us in this transaction , you are advised to furnish us with the following

One of my colleagues and i involved in this deal will come to your contry to arrange for our share upon conformation from you that the money has hit your nominated bank account. 
   
  All these will only take us about 14 working days to transfer this fund into your account from the day we receive the requirements. Your line of business in this transaction does not matter. Honesty and your ability to keep it secret and keep our own share safe when the money hits your account is what matters it is important that we perfectly understand and co-operate with one another to ensure that this business is successfully concluded. I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending transaction when i have heard from you.

Outer Circle

London

Good Day

Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet your 
business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr. Amos 
Tower, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known bank, 
here in London, England.

One of our accounts, with holding balance of  
£15,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last 
operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the 
owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on 
the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham; you can view 
this CNN website 

http://edition.cnn. 
com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/  for details on the crash.

Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this 
money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the 
existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from 
the National Immigration also states that he was
single on entry into 
the UK.

I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank 
officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal 
with. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the 
next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you 
after necessary processes have been followed.

This transaction is 
totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does 
not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal 
act.

On your interest, let me hear from you.

Warm Regards,

Mr. Amos 
Tower.

Attn: Dear Friend,

I wish my proposal would not come to you as a surprise. I am LEE TSONG,
I 
work as you would have seen with CITICORP, although this being a brief 
introduction.

Anyway, we had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin) who deposited

a 
huge sum of amount, US$28.5million (Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank.

Unfortunately, this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT 
NO.990 
that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A. Confirmable from the below 
website 
www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html

http://www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html or

www.greatdreams.com/plane990.htm but, since then we have not had 
anybody to 
come for the claims as the next of kin. A situation I have monitored 
closely 
with my position in the bank.

Now, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before

his 
death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past 
two 
years plus, I have removed the file to my ""private vault"".

I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as 
every 
other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a

foreigner to enable me move the funds to his account. This does not 
have any 
risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled

by 
me and every loop holes sealed off.

I therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message 
and I 
will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this 
deal. 
What you stand to gain would be discussed and it is negotiable before 
the 
deal commences.

NOTE: PLEASE KINDLY SEND YOUR TO THE ADDRESS BELOW

Believing to hear from you soonest.

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Twenty six million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who

to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to
receive this money, as long as you will remain honest
to me till the end for this important
business trusting in you and believing  in God that
you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Chiedo Jonathan, the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing I discovered
a floating fund  in an account opened in the bank in
1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this
account again, after going through some old files in
the records I discovered that the owner of the account
died without a [heir]  hence  the money is floating
and  if I do not remit this money out urgently it will
be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a foreigner,
and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Phillip
Morris until his death was the manager Morris & Morris
Coy.(pty). SA.


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account,

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and
Twenty Six million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a
local person here, without valid nternational
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip
Morris  is a foreigner too, [and the money can only be
approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address  from the Girl who
operates computer, I am revealing this to you with
believe in God that you will never let me down in this
business, you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable  and will meet up with instruction of a key
bank official who is deeply involved with me in this
business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately

and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries

2004 till date, I have been looking for Mr. kwme kuffo
relation's and relatives/Next of Kin to come and claim
Mr. kwme kuffo Fund which he Deposited with our bank,
I have contacted his Embassy and after 3days, his
Ambassador told me that Mr. kwme kuffo has no relation
and no next of kin, their Ambassador told me that
Mr.kwme kuffo used his first son as his next of kin, but it
is quite unfortunate that Mr. kwme kuffo died with all
his family members.

The reason why I contacted you is
thus, Mr. kwme kuffo is dead, and his only son whom
supposed to inherit his properties and money also,
died with him.

As at this moment, nobody or Person[s]
is coming to claim this money from our bank.

The board directors and management of our bank has told me
that if nobody or person[s] apply for the claim of Mr.
kwme kuffo Fund, the bank will return Mr. kwme kuffo
Fund into our Federal Reserve.

In the Light of the above, I want you to stand as the
Relation/relative of
Late Mr. kwme kuffo; I want you to act as the kwme kuffo
Brother, so that you will inherit Mr. kwme kuffon Money
which he deposited with our bank, it might interest
you to know that Mr. kwme kuffo has a Domiciliary Bank
Account with our Bank and he has a total sum of
US$9.2M Nine Million Two Hundred Dollars, this is the
exact amount which late Mr. kwme kuffo has in his
domiciliary Account, and this money is still in his
account as unclaimed money.

This transaction is very easy and simple, and it is
100% risk free, I'm the
Manager for International Relations with Barclays Bank of Ghana Limited, and 
the Management and Board
Directors of the Bank are waiting for me to provide to
them the Relation or next of Kin to late Mr. kwme kuffo,
of which I told them that I am still searching the
next of kin to the deceased.

Finally, if you are interested with this transaction, I will front you to 
the bank as the only next of kin to late Mr. kwme kuffo,
and I will let the bank know that you are the only
right person to inherit late Mr. kwme kuffon Funds and
properties.

If you agree with me, I will present you
to my bank as the rightful person/next of kin to Late
Mr. kwme kuffo, and all Mr. kwme kuffo Properties and his
Money US$9.2M Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars will be Transferred into your own Account as
Mr. kwme kuffo next of kin.

If you are interested, just email me. If you are
interested, late Mr. kwme kuffo Funds will be credited
into your Account.

So reply me immediately and let me know what you say.

Feel free to ask any questions.

We will share Late Mr. kwme kuffo Funds 50-50; you will
take 50% of the US$9.2M. Which is US$4.600, 000.00
Four Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars, while the
Balance of the same amount will be mine.

I will be waiting for your immediate response,

Thanks and have a nice day.

With immense regards,

S. Dollars ($15,200,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $15.2m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount. we have agreed in principles and have gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice  to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 20% of the $15.2 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses.

 The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my  e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in
 a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.

 Send your fax and telephone number to enable me reach you immediately. Reply to mssa@hknetmail.com

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

CITIBANK,
364 Kensington High St
London W14 
8NS

Dear Friend,

I am Dr. Robin Quest the Chief auditor general of 
CITIBANK 364 Kensington High St London W14 8NS. I have urgent and very 
confidential business proposition for you. On May 20, 1999, an Iraqi 
Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the BRITISH PETROLUEM 
CORPORATION Mr. Dara Baraz. Made a numbered time (Fixed deposit) for 24 
calendar months, valued at US$32,200,000.00 (Thirty two Million two 
hundred thousand dollars only) in this bank. Upon maturity in 2001, I 
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no 
reply. 

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered 
from his contract employers, the British petroleum corporation that Mr. 
Dara Baraz died as a result of torture in the hand of Sadam Hussein 
during one of his trips to his country Iraq. On further investigation, 
I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to 
trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further 
investigation and discovered that mr Dara Baraz did not declare any kin 
or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit 
paperwork in my Bank.

This sum of US$32,200,000.00 has been floating 
as unclaimed since 1999 in my bank as all efforts to get his relatives 
have hit the stones. According to the British law at the expiration of 
6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British 
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund and the six years is the 
end of September 2005 Consequently, my proposal is that i want to seek 
your consent as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money as 
the next of kin to the deceased so that the bank will transfer the 
money to your desi gnated account. All documents and proves to enable 
you get this fund will be carefully worked out. I have secured from the 
probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased 
beneficiaries, and more so I are assuring you that the business is 
risk 
free involvement. 

Your share stays while the rest be for me and 
for investment purpose as I will leave London by the end of the year. 
The sharing of the funds will be based According to agreement within 
you and me. As soon as i receive an acknowledgement of receipt of this 
message in acceptance of our mutual business proposal, I will furnish 
you with the necessary modalities and disbursement ratio to suit both 
parties without any conflict. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do 
not take undue advantage of the trust i have bestowed in you.

PLEASE, 
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT DOING BUSINESS OVER THE INTERNET IS RISK. 
ENDEAVOR TO SEND YOUR CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER IN
YOUR 
REPLY TO THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

CHINA MERCHANT BANK.
DES BOUEX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG. 


NOTIFICATION AS NEXT OF KIN/BENEFICIARY 

DATE: 18/10/2006

I am Mr.Joseph Yun, credit officer of the China Merchant Bank.I have a  concealed business suggestion for 
you.


Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Gen.Talfik Haddad who was  with the Iraqi forces and also business 
man made a numbered fixed  deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Three Million,Six  
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.


Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war. Again after the war another notification 
was sent and still  no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his  family had been 
killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered 
that the General did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the  paper work of his bank 
deposit.  
And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in 
my bank. So, Twenty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is 
still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. 


What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my  country at the expiration three years the funds 
will revert to the ownership  of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this 
backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as  a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to 
Gen.Talfik Haddad so that you  will be able to receive his funds. 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we  shall come out successful. 
I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document  that will back you up as the next of 
kin to the late General,all that is  required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full  
Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of 
kin,the attorney will also file  in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and  letter of 
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that  will be provided by you. 

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a  legalized method and the attorney 
will prepare all the necessary  documents.  
Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning  this issue. Once the funds have 
been transferred to your nominated bank account we  shall share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you 
and 5%for any  expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please 
send me your private phone and fax  numbers for easy communication, you can write me via my private 
box thus:  (josef_yun499@yahoo.com.hk ) and i will provide you with more details of  this transaction.


Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.


Kind Regards, 
Mr. Josef Yun.

Goodday Dear,


I know this mail will come to you as a surprise,nevertheless I am Mrs. Lydia Johnson, aged 59 years,
the wife of Major stephen johnson, Chief Security Officer and Aide-de�camp to the exiled president
Charles Tailor of Liberia . As a result of the on-going problem in my country, I am saddled with
problems of my ill-health of protracted diabetes and high blood pressure which is getting of increase in
the recent times, more importantly getting a trust worthy individual abroad to receive the sum of
US$7million on our behalf.
Due to this war crises presently in my city Monrovia our home town, I managed to sneak myself and my son
David 23 years of age and four other of my daughters out of Monrovia to Dakar senegal for safety. We were
sneaked into Dakar Senegal through the land boarder by the help of some
government militant group. After the killing of my husband by the
rebels, we decided to come down here to Dakar senegal to secure the deposit in a
finance firm by my husband and to further look for a trust worthy
individual abroad to receive these deposit which has being deposited here in Dakar
Senegal before he was eventually killed by the heartless rebels. I feel
confident therefore to introduce myself to you based on this problem and our present condition
as all our foreign contacts and connections got lost during this crises,
all properties burnt by the rebels. I am desperately in need to move and re-locate this huge deposit to your
country for safe keeping as this is the only wealth remaining for the future survival and well being of my large family.
For your percentage for assistance, a negotiable percentage will be
discussed as soon as I receive your response based on this plea for your
assistance as our lives are highly in danger due to this problem. I pray and plead for your help. You can email me back for
further clarifications God bless you as you respond to my plea for
assistance.

Sincerely

yours.

Director of Projects, DME, South Africa.

I am Dr. John Mikado, Director of projects Implementation South Africa Department of Minerals & Energy. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach  you for a transaction / business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to count on you as a respected & honest person to handle this transaction with sincerity, trust & confidentiality. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep confidential because of the nature of the transaction.

Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I work as a director of projects Implementation and with the co-operation of three other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling 28.5million US dollars. which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a company or individual to receive the said funds on our behalf. We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the said funds, More so, we are handicapped in the circumstance as the South Africa Civil Service code of conduct does not allow us to operate foreign account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount (US$28.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance of the US$28.5m. which we have in principle gotten approvals from the Department of Finance and the contract review and payment committee to transfer by telegraphic transfer to any bank account you will provide. It does not matter whether you or your company does contract projects as a transfer of power and privileges with details & change of information upon application to reflect payment in favour of  you or your company will be secured on behalf of you or your company.

I have the mandate of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be US$7.125m 25% of the US$28.5 million, US$19.95m 70% for us and US$1.425m 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe and secure, on your part provided you treat it with ultmost confidentiality. Also, your area of trade or specialization is not an hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Please, endeavour to contact me immediately through my email for further clarifications.

I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in the position to make the payment of this funds possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential, and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Best Regards,
 
Dr. John Mikado.

NB: please reply with your confidential contact phone & fax numbers, to enable me contact you urgently for further clarifications.

I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment now. I am married to Dr.Waltner De Matinez who worked with angolan embassy in mexico for over nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual to that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of the lord is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don`t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don`t want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the  Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you. please reply me through my private email; Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

Oliveira Savimbi <olivsav@netscape.net>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Tue, 24 Dec 2002 16:52:18 -0000",PRIVATE EMAIL MESSAGE,"Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season.

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. 

My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!
 political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. 

President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.

Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Dearest In Christ,

I am Mrs Elizabeth Williams,from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Jerry Williams,
who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Six years before
he died in the year 2001,after a brief illness that lasted for only five
days.  We were married for Eighteen years with a duaghter(Lilian)who later
died in a motor accident.

Before the untimely death of my husband,we were both born again Christians.
Since after his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive
he deposited the sum of (US$5.8 M)(Five Million,Eight hundred Thousand United
States Dollar) in a General Trust Account with a prime bank in Abidjan Cote
d'Ivoire. Presently,this money is still with the bank. 

Recently,Following my ill health, my Doctor told me that I may not last for
the next eight months due to my cancer problem.The one that disturbs me most
is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to a Christain organization (Church) that will utilize this money the
way I am going to instruct herein,according to the desire of my late husband
before his death.

I want this fund to be used in Christain Activities like,Orphanages, Christain
schools, and Churches for propagating the word of God and to endeavor that
the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that ""Blessed
is the hand that giveth"". I took this decision because I don't have any child
that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians
and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't
want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is

I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus
14 VS 14 says that ""the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"".
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health
hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want
them to know about this development.With God all things are possible. 

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank
in Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present
beneficiary of this fund. 
I want you and the Church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard.

to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful
all through your life. Contact me on this e-mail address:(elizabeth_w1007@yahoo.com).

Jacob Uderike <jacobuderike@msn.com>,,"Fri, 04 Nov 2005 16:32:42 +0000",Urgent reply needed. ,"Dear :sir

I am Mr.JACOB UDERIKE, an accountant of the standard trust
bank Plc,Lagos Branch.I have urgent and very
confidential business proposal for you. I got your
contact from the world trade center (W.T.C.)regional
office in Lagos,Nigeria although the details of my
intention was not made known to them.

On June 6 1999, An American oil consultant/contractor
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,
Mr.Trevor made a numbered time (fixed) deposited for
twelve calendar valued atUS$18,000,000.00(eighteen
Million Dorllars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent
a routine notification to his forwarding address but
got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and
finally I discovered from his contact employers
Nigerian National Petroleum corporation that Mr.Trevor
died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, I found out that he did not leave a
WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were
fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr.Trevor did not declare any next of kin in all
his official documents,including his Bank Deposit
paperwork. This sum of US$18,000,000.00 is still
sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No
one will come forward to claim it.According to the
Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6(six) years, the
money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Trevor
so that the fruits of this old mans labor will not get
into the hands of some corrupt government officials.

This is simple;

1. I will like you to provide me immediately with your
full names and address so that the attorney will
prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which
will put you in place as the next of kin.

2,your privet telephone and fax number for rasy
communication The money will be paid into your account
for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for
you and 10% for the expencis that we are going to make
both local and international during this process
ofthis transacation.

There is no risk at all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch accountant guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you
are interested, please reply immediately via the
private email address below.
(jacobuderike@yahoo.com)
Upon your response, I
shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable
for both of us because I shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country.

Thanks and regards.

Mr.JACOB UDERIKE

Dear Sir,

My name is Mr.EVANS PETER, I work in the credit andaccounts
department of Union Bank of Nigeria
Plc,Lagos, Nigeria.

I write you in respect of a foreign customer with
Domicilliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is
Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among
those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during
the reign of late General Sani Abacha.

Sir,since the demise of this our customer, EngineerJoseph
Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor,I have kept a
close watch of the deposit records andaccounts and since
then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next
of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his
a/c and the
a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the
code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands
now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed
information other than my very self considering my position
in the bank.

Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim
the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co
operation in using your name as the 
next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a
foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself
and you. At this point I am the only one with the
information because I have removed the deposit file from the
safe .

By this doing, what is required of you is to send an
application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to
the late Engineer.

I will need your full name and address, company or
residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with
next of kin column in the certificate of deposit.

Finally i want you to understand that the request for a
foreigner as the next of kin is occassioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a
local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me,
then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between
us.

Trusting to hear from you, I remain

Respectfully yours,
 Mr.EVANS PETER

Fax    +2711-507-5946

ATTN: DIRECTOR/CEO.

I am MR ALBERT SITHOLI, the Bank Manager of Amalgamated Bank of South
Africa {ABSA}. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for
you. An American Gold Consultant/Contractor with the South African Solid
Gold Corporation, Mr. Glenn Hatleberg made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit
for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million
Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Solid
Gold Corporation that Glenn Hatleberg died in a plane crash in Alaska
Airlines Flight #261 (for more information about this crash and person,
you can contact this website:
http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/

Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I
found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace
his next of Kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and
discovered that Mr. Glenn Hatleberg did not declare any Kin or relations
in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my
Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of
Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 6 (SIX) years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the next of kin to Mr. Glenn Hatleberg so that the fruits of this
old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of Kin. We
shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of
the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
Probate/Administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in
any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the Beneficiary/next of Kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me
and 30% for you, then 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may
incur during transactions.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please
reply immediately via the private Fax and Phone numbers below. Upon your
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me
your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. And
kindly observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

My private Phone +27-73-400-4485 or Fax +27-11-507-5946.  I wait for your
quick response.

Dear.Sir

       It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet. 
My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.

My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.
Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.
It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.
This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE
 and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.
And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.
Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.
So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  
I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.
Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project. 

Best regards,

Dear Friend,
                              ASSISTANCE

Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I am GEORGE KABILA,the son
of the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire)
Mr.Laurent Desire Kabila.

I am contacting you in other to ask for your assistance on this confidential
Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us.

Before I go into further details please be informed that I am writing without
any other person(s)
pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction.

Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.

I have the sum of USD20.7Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my father
before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th
2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to Security reasons, as
my narration below will explain.

But before I continue be well informed that your share in this transaction has
been calculated as 15% of the total sum of USD$20.7M, 5% for expenses and the
rest for my family and I.
My father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having
married to so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my father, My
step brother Joseph, who is currently the  president of my country, is the son
of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.

Already president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and
private property, which my late father left behind for the entire family.

Now my mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late
father's wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your
assistance to help us receive this money overseas for proper investment.

Let me quickly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free because the
diamond sales are packaged from  the unset in a pattern that shows no direct
trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the money is deposited and
is secured with a holding company under deposit account.

I am waiting for your swift and favourable response, and in case you have any
question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.

My alternative e mail address is : gkabila@hispavista.com

Best Regards.


George Kabila.

Dear, 

                                  Re: Next of Kin

I am Caspar J. Justin an Attorney at Law, a South African national
practicing here in the UK.

I am writing to notify you of the TESTAMENT of one or our Client who
unfortunately lost his life in the Madrid bomb blast on March 11, 2004,
killing over two hundred people including tourists in Spain. He was a
prominent business leader who had been in Spain for vacation with his wife
and their only daughter. 

The deceased who was residing in the United States of America before his
death made a deposit of Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars (US$15,500,000.00) in Amsterdam Netherlands, his effort to avoid the
obligatory payment of income tax in the United States of America.

However, I was mandated by our team of professionals to search for the
relatives of the deceased regarding his deposit as the holding financial
institution wants him to come forward for the endorsement of the
reinvestments documents on interest accrued.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his Next
of Kin or relatives to come over to sign the reinvestment documents or claim
his deposit because the financial institution cannot release these funds
unless a formal application is made which is in line with the Royal Dutch
law on inheritance claim.

Regrettably, I learnt that his supposed Next of Kin, which could be his
spouse or his only daughter died along with him in the ugly Madrid Bomb
Blast leaving nobody with the knowledge of this huge deposit except me as
the personal lawyer attached to monitor his deposit. It is in this regard
that I and my colleagues decided to solicit your assistance by presenting
you as the next of kin to the deceased. Although, we have agreed on the
following sharing ratios: 25% for your assistance and 75% for me and my
colleagues but it is still negotiable.

NB: This transaction is very confidential and 100% risk free as I have a
copy of his LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT which I can present your name as the
TRUSTEE & EXECUTOR. This transaction shall be executed under legitimate and
legal procedures that will protect you from any breach of the Law.

Therefore, do not hesitate to revert back to me, either via fax or email,
with the following details if my proposal interests you:  A signed copy of
this letter, your address and your telephone and fax numbers.

My name is Mr. Micheal Ipenza, I am an auditor in Standard Bank of South Africa . I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been well taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. 

I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. 
To ease your apprehension, I got your contact from the British chambers of commerce and industry, foreign trade division. 
An account was open by a  foreigner named Gerald Welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife 
on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board.
 
PROPOSITION; 
 
Since his death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident(May his soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. 

Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds Twenty- five million United States dollars (US$25,000,000.00) in a domiciliary account to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. 
 
Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year. 
It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. 

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested. 
 
1.A Beneficiary name;. In order for me to prepare the PAPER WORK for transfer of the funds in your name. And also I want you to come down to South Africa to open a non-resident account for onward transfer to your overseas account, and for us to see face to face. 

2. Details, particulars of your contact address. 

3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers;. For our personal contact and for the confidentiality of this transactions. 

I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total sum on final 
conclusion of this project for your assistance, as I have also thought of doling out 5% to charity organisation from your locality based on your recommendation another 5% for the services of the lawyer while the balance 65% shall be for me for investment purposes in your country as I cannot bring back this cash to my country. 
 
If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly desist from responding at all if you do NOT intend to render any assistance.

Though my father is very rich and was never generous. But now I regret all this, as I know that there is more in life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.The bible says what shall it profit a man to wine the whole world and loose his soul. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I will live my life a different way from how I have lived before. I have willed and given most of my fathers properties to the less privileges because I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul. I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged in our societies. I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth since my father has never recognized that.So far I have to distribute money to charity organizations now that my health has deteriorated so badly,I cannot do this myself anymore that is why am soliciting your assistant to make this donation through you. The last of my late fathers money that am willing to donate to the less privileged right now is the huge sum of $10.6M USD that is concealed in a consignment and deposited in (OVERSEA CREDIT COMMISSION ABROAD) for safekeeping which he intends to invest on profitable factory. I want you to help me claim this funds where is deposited and disburse it to charity organizations and the less privileged in the society.Please I will appreciate you to indicate interest for the disbursement and also include your contact telephone/fax numbers that I will forward to the(OVERSEA CREDIT COMMISSION ABROAD) to be able to contact you as the appointed beneficiary. I will provide you the certificate of deposit and the letter of authority to enable you claim the consignment of the funds.If you are willing and ready to assist with this project,please e-mail me at mrslsabellacaromel_1950@yahoo.it without delay, while I wait to hear from you.Thanks once again for your kindness may God guide and reward you in all your endeavors as you make me realize my last dreams and wishes.Remain blessed,Mrs.Isabella Caromel ________________________________________________ Cristina Fusi WebMail - Message sent using UebiMiau 2.7.2",0,1

RE:
TRANSFER OF 32,350,000.00 MILLION US DOLLARS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. My name 
is Dr.Mark Kingsley William, and I work in the International Operation 
Department in a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you 
in this important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been 
greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still 
remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this 
correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as 
such. 

At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 
100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO  TRANSFER OUT 
MONEY  FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN 
ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS  A FOREIGNER, a  program leader.
Until his death,The Late Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri,  has a huge 
investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a 
matter of fact he has the sum of( THIRTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND 
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ) in his account here in London which he 
deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about this 
deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant 
domiciliary account with a BAL. Of ( THIRTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED 
AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ) on further discreet investigation, I also 
discovered that the account holder has  passed away (dead) leaving no 
beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any 
foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am 
certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. 
A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account 
Holder, therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will 
provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money, 
Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k!

Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), 
married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and 
business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-
1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 
20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when 
explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his 
motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital,

Federal Ministry of works and housing
Federal secretariat office complex
Garki,Abuja,
Nigeria. 
ATTN: Dear Friend,
Request for assistance: Strictly Confidential 

I am Engr; Abubakar Saeed, the director of works FMW&H 

Nigeria and chairman of contract award and review committee 

set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present 

civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review 

existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and 

reputable person to handle a very confidential 

transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of 

money to a foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of 

ultinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of 

the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H). The 

original value of these contracts were delibrately over 

invoiced to the sum of USD$9.6,000,000.00 (Nine million six 

hundred united state dollars).This amount has now been 

approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the 

companies that actually executed these contracts have been 

fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the 

total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, 

since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of 

conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or 

opening foreign accounts in our names. 
Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this is 

enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 

transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental 

expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the 

course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the 

balance to other accounts in due course.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the 

ministry of finance and the Central bank of Nigeria for the 

immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days 

subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our 

assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this 

transaction  the legality it deserves and for mutual security 

of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially 

and legally processed with your name or the name of any 

company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary.

Once more I want you to understand that having put in over 

twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am 

averse to having my image and career dented. 
This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy 

and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your 

intention to assist by  you sending me a mail through my 

confidential email address so that I can brief you further 

(abu_saeed04@tiscali.co.uk).

I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk 

free as we have done our home work properly. I quite believe 

that you will protect our interest by taking this deal 

strictly confidential, as we are still in government 

service,which we intend to retire from.  
kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us 

include this transfer in the first batch which would 

constitute the first quarter payments for the 2004 financial 

year.

Thanks and God bless.

Mrs. Jay Afolabi <jafo57@tiscali.co.uk>,,,(Peace),"Dear Sir/Madam

At this perceived confusion or stress may have With due respect. Sorry receiving
this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite that,
I am constrained to write you this letter because of
the urgency of it. 

By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr.
Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position
in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award
SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national
identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues were
then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.

Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleagues
so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock
during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his
case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enough
to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.


However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and
untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because
I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my
late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs
to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger
brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken
all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses
and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United
States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but
again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other travelling
document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in
obnoxious custom and traditional norms.
 
Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company
in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one
Security company in Europe. It has therefore become
very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help
me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presumably
an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf
as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country.
These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detection,
seizure or diversion.
 
I have had several communication with  the Director of the security company
in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's
demands.

This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiving
these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance
that you will not divert the fund if you help me. 
 
My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is
all my children and I have got to live on. 
 
Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint
me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile
No and also your fax no for easier communication.
The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely
kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help
me.

Thank in advance for confidentiality and I look forward to hearing from
you.

Mrs. Joy Afolabi.

No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that the account is a secret account.
The total amount involved is Sixteen million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only [$16,700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information about the account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total amount,70% will be for us, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest reply. PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.

Best Regards,

Edward Nkanga

DR.YUSUFF KADOSO (PhD).

DEAR SIR, 

RE:URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP/PARTNERSHIP.

First I must solicit your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 
I am making this contact with you based on reliable information available
to us courtesy of our local chamber of Commerce and Industry, thus we are
convinced that you would be capable of providing us with a solution to a money 
transfer transaction of US$36,400,000.00 (Thirty-Six Million, Four Hundred Thousand 
United States Dollars ).

Source:During the last military regimes here in Nigeria,government officials set
up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were to be paid from the Petroleum 
Trust Fund (PTF) set up by the military regime for the purpose of financing special 
projects and these were grossly over-invoiced.The present civilian government have 
constituted an Interim Management Committe (IMC) with the mandate to investigate all 
contracts awarded as well as carry out debt verification of all claims that have not yet
been paid with a view of settling all legitimate debts owed by the Federal Government 
of Nigeria to both local and foreign contractors before the government wind up the Trust 
Fund.

We as members of this committee have identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are 
presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria. In the meantime, the government has 
already made a budget allocation for the payment of these contracts, but by virtue of our 
Position as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire this fund in our 
names. I was delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look for an overseas partner 
into whose account we would transfer the funds totaling (USD36,400,000.00) and you will be
 adequately compensated with 25% of the entire sum, hence we are writing you this mail.

The present Civilian Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debt owed so 
as to maintain an amiable relationship with both the Foreign Governments and Non Government
Financial Agencies and to attract foreign investment into our economy. We have decided to 
include our bills for approval with the co-operation of some officials of the Federal Ministry 
of Finance (F.M.F) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N.).

We seek your assistance in providing us the a good company account or personal account into
which we can remit this money, you will be acting as an ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR in this deal, 
the fund will be paid to you.

This we can do by SWAPPING of account information and changing of beneficiary information to
apply for payment. We prepare letters of claims and job description on your behalf, on 
receiption of the following information (your banker's name and address, account number,
your telephone and fax numbers) It is our intention therefore, while having your 
understanding and co-operation to invest 70% of this funds in the importation of 
agricultural and oil prospecting equipment to sub-western region of Africa.
While the balance 5% will cater for all local and foreign expenses incurred in facilitating 
the transfer of this funds. Please contact me immediately you receive this mail by contacting me on
my confidential email address (yusuffkadoso101@yahoo.com) thus signifying your capability and willingness to assist us. 


We are building our trust on sincerity of purpose, mutual understanding and recommendation.

The business itself is 100% safe and fail proof, provided you treat it with utmost 
secrecy and confidentiality and you follow my instructions carefully and religiously.
Your line of specialization does not matter as it cannot hinder the successful execution 
of this transaction. 

Again we look forward to doing business with you and solicit your utmost confidentiality in 
this transaction.

Thank you for your co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

DR. YUSUFF KADOSO.

N.B. The telecommunication system in my country is very poor, please do not be discouraged 
if you have difficulty in contacting me, your efforts will be much appreciated.

Dear Sir,

Compliments Of The Day, Permit me to introduce myself
to you. My name is DR Andrew Godson,a top Management

I came to know about you in my private search for a
reliable person/company to handle an important
assingment on behalf of my Colleagues and myself.

PROPOSITION: An Australian Engr Donald Pepper, a
prosperous Oil/Gold merchant had in our Bank the sum
of $28.5million in a domiciliary account.
Unfortunately, he was killed in a ghastly motor
accident in Benin Republic in 2001. Efforts had been made by
the management of my bank through the Australian
Embassy to contact any of the deceased children but to
no avail.
We later discovered that he had no children.Given the
skeletal information available to the bank,it has so
far been impossible to reach any of the relatives.

The situation left for the Management is to declare
the deceased account dormant and revert the funds to
trading for interest to the Bank. In order to avoid
this development, my Colleagues and I now seek your
approval to have you stand as a distant relative to
Engr Donald Pepper,so that the money would be released
to you.

All documents and proofs to enable you get the money
will be carefully packaged once we receive your
consent on this proposal.I shall apply for a leave as
soon as the funds get into your reliable account to
come to your country for sharing and investments which
you will assist me in doing.
May I assure you that this is safe and risk-free, as
we have taken care of all necessary modalities to
ensure a hitch-free movement. I have the authority of
my partners involved in this assignment to propose
that should you be willing to assist us in this,your
share would be 25%.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint me.

Best Regards,
DR Andrew Godson.

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of twenty one Million Dollars ($21,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company does not know the content as money, although my father made them to under stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner.

Source of the money:
My late father Chief Paul Coleman , a native of Mende District in the Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales.

Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to HOLLAND NETHERLAND, with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aid
of U.N evacuation team.

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation,we are nowlike refugees and orphans.

SOUTH AFRICA



Dear SIR/MADAM,

Peace and love of God be with You.I guess this letter may come to you as a 
surprise since i had no previous correspondence with you.Please excuse me 
the emberassment this letter might cause you and try to excesise a little 
patience in other to understand its content properly.

I learnt that many Africans has used the advantage of what happened to us in 
my country to deceive some innocent souls and may be some has even used my 
fathers name because of his purpularity and greatness.But what we all need 
to understand in this world is that everybody will answer for him or herself 
on the last day.

My name is Mr VINO.F.KONI and i am the only son of my parents. Myfather is 
Mr Johnson Koni and my mother is mrs Rose.s.Koni. I am a graduate of federal 
university of science and technology Harare,Zimbabwe and my discipline is 
Agricultural engineering.After my graduation,I decided to work for my father 
as his manager.My father has two big farms that are well known in Zimbabwe 
and has many workers that were working for him.

I managed my fathers farms for two years before we had in my country.I got 
your contact through network online decided to write you to explain my 
situation and request for your assistance.

This crises was as a result of a new land Act reform introduced by president 
Robert Mugabe which wholly affected most white farmers and few black 
farmers.This resulted in the killing and mob action  by Zimbabwean war 
veterans and some lunatics in the society.Infact a lot of people were killed 
because of this land reform act of which my father was a victim.

But before the death of my father,  as if he knew he was going to die 
informed me about the money he deposited with a security and finance firm in 
South Africa.The total amount is twenty three million,two hundred thousand 
POUNDS (M23,200,000,POUNDS) and this money was deposited in a box as germ 
stones to avoid much demurrage from the Security and finance firm. This 
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the 
farms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland.

One month after my father's death,I and my mother decided to travell to 
South Africa for our lives and decided to look for a trustworthy foreigner 
who will help us to transfer this money out of South Africa
because we are staying as refugees here in South Africa and refugees are not 
alowed to open bank accounts or involved in any financial transaction in 
South Africa.I have all the documents concerning
this money and what i am seeking for is a genuine foreign account where this 
money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who 
are bent on collecting everything that belongs to my father.

All i am looking for is an honest business man or woman, whom I can entrust 
my future and that of my family . I must also let you know that this 
transaction is 100%risk free. If you accept to assist
me and my family all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and 
come to Johannesburg  South Africa, so that you can help me open a 
nonresident account in your name which will aid us in transferring the money 
into any account you will nominate overseas.

If you are willing to help me,I have two options of compasaction for 
you,firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for 
nominating your account for this transaction, Or you can
go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the 
money in your country. Which ever the option you chooses,feel free to notify 
me.

I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might 
incure in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a 
partnership I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the remaining 
70% will remain for me and my family.If you are realy capable and willing to 
assist me please contact me immediately through my direct telephone number 
+27-82-679-3775 or this e-mail address with which i have sent you this 
message.

Finally, please treat this matter as urgent as to save my family from much 
expences caused by demaurage being accumulating on daily bases for the money 
in the security company.Thanks for your mutual
co-operation while i wait for your soonest response.Remain blessed.

Yours Faithfuly,
MR VINO.F.KONI

l am Dr.Titi Okonkwo., Civil Servant in the Ministry 
of Health. l know this proposal will come to you as 
asurprise because we have not met before either 
physically or through correspondence. 
I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here
in Nigeria and have no doubt in your ability to handle
this proposal involving huge sum of money. 
My father Chief Isama Okonkwo (Now Late) was the Royal
Head of my community, ELEME (an oil rich town) in
Nigeria. My community produces 5.8% of the total crude
oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the Dollar value
of each barrel is paid to my father as royalty by the
Federal Government. My father was also the Chairman of
ISAMA Special Oil Trust Fund. In his position as the
Royal head and Chairman of the Oil Trust Fund, he made
some money which he left for me as the only heir to
inherit.
The money is Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand
US Dollars(US$18.5). This Money originated from the
accumulated royalties between 1976-1998 . Due to poor
banking system in Nigeria and political instability as
a result of past Military rules (1985-1999) , he
deposited this Money in a Strong Room/""VAULTS"" with an
open beneficiary in a security company pending when he
would finish arrangement to transfer it abroad . He
was planning this when he died late last year of Heart
Attack. 
Just before my father died he called my attention to
the money and charged me to look for a foreigner who
would assist me in the transfer/investment of the
funds abroad. So l would be very grateful if you could
accept to help me achieve this great objective. 
I promise to give you 15% of the total funds
transferred to your vital bank account as compensation
for your assistance. Five percent (5%)has been set
aside to take care of all expenses we may incure
during the transaction. To indicate your interest,
contact me urgently and confidentially for more
information and the roles you will play in this
business. 
All the legal Documents concerning this Money will be
sent to you as soon as we agreed together. Please I will 
appreciate that you send your telephone/fax numbers to 
enable me contact you immediately for discussions. 
May the almighty God bless you. 
Yours faithfully,

the Finance House which was sent to his forwarding address. After a month,
we got a reminder from the Finance House and I had to verify his whereabout
from his contract employers, the NNPC.

Unfortunately, I was informed by the NNPC that my client died from an automobile
accident about a month to the first letter froim the Finance House. As his
legal representative, I know that my client died without making a WILL,and
all my attempts to trace his next of kin has been fruitless.

Furthermore, as his attorney, I am aware that he did not declare any next
of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Depository
Form with the Finance House.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration
of 3 (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives, I seek your
consent to present you as the next of kin of my late client so that the
proceeds of this account valued at 12 million dollars (minus incurred interest)can
be paid to you. I will expect you to use your human discretion in sharing
the funds when it's been transferred into your custody.

I will put together all necessary legal documents that can be used to back
up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable
us see this deal through particularly your words of honor not to sit on
the funds when it's in your control.

 Please! I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with
me by my email and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us
discuss furtherabout this transaction.

I wait to hear from you soon. Have a nice day.Thank you.

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Dayo Naps, an official with one of the APEX banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent and very confidential 
business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and
his present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
 Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless, as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not 
declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still 
lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one 
will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money 
will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all 
we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would
put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the drafting
and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your 
favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you.

There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager 
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email.

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall 
still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our 
share . 

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Engr. Sule Alkali Director, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) Lagos, and have been delegated by my colleagues to seek the assistance of a reliable foreign company or individual into whose bank account we can transfer the sum of $36,560,000.00 USD (Thirty Six Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand U.S. Dollars Only). This sum arose from a deliberate over-invoicing of contract bills of some contracts, which were awarded by us (MPNR) during the administration of the former military dictator late, General Sanni Abacha who died on 7th June 1998. Since then the money has been lying in our suspense current account of MPNR with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)(our Apex Bank). However, the current favorable political/Economical climate in the country now presents an opportunity for this money to be Transferred out of our country without any hitches - as we hope and believe it would be of mutual benefit to both of us.

Already, we have put in motion the complete machinery and modalities to enhance successful commencement and completion of this transaction and further actions will commence the moment we hear from you. We have agreed that after the transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 20% of the total sum. My two colleagues and I shall take 70% while 10% is being mapped out for reimbursement of minor expenses that may be incurred during the course of this transaction. Conclusively, the nature of your business is not particularly relevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate with us, and also an assurance that our Share of the funds will be given to us when the money arrives your account.

Most importantly, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure a no risk situation on the side of both parties as this transaction is expected to be through within 10 to 14 working days. Please if the proposal is acceptable to you, contact me immediately through this email address sulealkali10@netscape.net However, if you are not interested, kindly let us know and do not disclose the content of this letter to any third party. Kindly include your private Telephone and Fax numbers while replying for easy and effective communication.

The trust we have reposed in you at this point is enormous and cannot be over-emphasized. We await your prompt response to this proposal, so we can commence immediate release proceedings with our good positions.

fundamental because I and My Family are in serious problem 
and we need your help .My Name is Mrs Rachael oniga, daughter Of late Mr

I am about to tell you something that I have not
discuss with anyone excluding my lawyer. My father was a big time
farmer in south Africa, he uses most of South Africa land for farming. The
Government in South Africa gave him those lands for farming and he will pay
back
when he have the money, it was like a loan they gave him the lands as loan
My
father was very successful In the farming business and he paid all the
Government
back. Some top officials In the Government were Jealous because of his
wealth. They wanted him to Join them carry out a dubious deal against
the Government but he refuse ,so they plan to kill him and claim all his
wealth he has suffered for, in South Africa. On his way home one day he was
coming from the office
and he was assassinated and he was rushed to the hospital by a good
Samaritan. But he did not
survive It .But before they killed him he saw It coming and transfer
most of his fund to a Security company In Holland. He died In the hospital
,But before he died he gave me the contact Information to the Security
company which the fund was located.

Those people were looking for me and my family and
we ran to Nigeria for safety because they know we know were my father
funds were hidden. I contacted the Security company
yesterday on how I could collect the funds with my lawyer assistance and
they told
me that I need a foreign beneficiary outside Africa because of Security
reasons. And I dont have anyone outside Africa that will stand for me as a
beneficiary. 
They said the money was too big (TWENTY MILLION USDOLLARS)My father never 
told me the amount of the money I was so shock. They also said that the

Dear sir/Madam,

I am Ben Maluleke, a Native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an 
Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural 
Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you 
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to 
confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.

Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council 
(SAEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided 
to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal 
described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it 
as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an 
director and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in 
our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-Seven Million, One 
Hundred Thousand united states dollars (US$27,100,000.00) which we want to 
transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign 
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf into a reliable 
company/individual account depending on your convenience.
More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil 
Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence 
your importance the whole transaction. This amount (US$27.1m) represents the 
balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a 
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. 
Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original 
contractor,leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have 
in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer 
(K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an 
application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the 
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be 
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% 
of the US$27.1 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous 
expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat 
it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization 
is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint 
me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my secured tel/fax number 
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will 
enable me contact other foreign partner with recommendation to carry out 
this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a 
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us 
a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and 
Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter
because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in 
active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the 
essence in this business.

Kindly establish your response directly by telephone:+27-

Mr. David Agu <adgua@mail.com>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Tue, 03 Dec 2002 19:47:42 -0000",INHERITANCE CLAIM,"ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR

I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. 

During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. 

I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 

I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. 

If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via Fax:234-1-7597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response.

                                                 CONFIDENTIAL IS THE
CASE"")

Compliment Of The Season,

On a very good day. I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in
African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist
search.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability
and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God
or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15
million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account
that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire
family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got
information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to
come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in
our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed
next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving
nobody behind for the claim.

 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my
department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety
and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont
want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in
this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that
30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the
provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses
incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman
colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement
according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location where the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of
the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.

You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon
as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Yours
faithfully,

BALA TOMSON (Esq.)


POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer
to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you
finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very
well over this business.

wang <wangqin_o@3xl.net>,,,CAN BE YOU SINCERE?,"
HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.
Dear Sir,
 Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. S!
 o, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years and 10 months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 
 Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.
 Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.
 Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
Kind Regards,
Mr. Wang  Qin

Fehmi Mehmet
110 Half Edge Lane,Ellesmere Park,
Eccles, Greater Manchester,
United Kingdom


My Name is Fehmi Mehmi and I am a staff of Natwest Bank London. I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 26.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty-Six Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. 

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. 

Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained after five years the money will be transferred into banking
treasury as unclaimed funds.

We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction.
Note this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail. Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.
Do call me and lets discuss more on this. 

Best regards
Fehmi Mehmet

																																                                       STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL  

       Dear:Sir/Madam,

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Mr. Mazuri Martins the first son of Mr.Philip Mazuri, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe .I got your contact through the internet network online hence I decided to write you.

Before the death of my father, he travelled to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$ 25.5Million (Twenty Five  Million Five  Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only, in one of the private security/finance companies, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe  .  This money was deposited in the security / finance company as family valuables and consignment to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines/ farm machineries and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm   in Swaziland because he is the chairman of the farmers association while Mum was the treasurer.     This land problem came ( and is still on )  when our President Mr. Robert  Mugabe introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers  and some few black  farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by the Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society hijacked the opportunity.  In fact, lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims, the news about the crisis in Zimbabwe is every where both in the CNN and BBC.

It is against this background that, I and my family  who are currently staying in South Africa now decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees(political asylum seekers)  to open any bank  account or to be involved in any financial  transaction throughout the  territorial zones of South Africa.  As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner with a good bank account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything.      All I seek for is your seriousness, for I am entrusting my future and that of my family into your hands .I must also let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free.  If you accept to assist my family and me all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg - South Africa (if possible), so that you can help me   open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in   transferring the money into any account you will nominate outside South Africa . This money I intend to use for investment in a good business venture.  
I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable business investment of the money in your country. Whichever option you want, feel free to notify me. I will also map out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we
might incur in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will remain for me and my family. If you are really capable and willing to assist me please contact me immediately with my alternative e-mail address  E-mail:martins.mazuri1@webmail.co.za  above for faster communication.     Finally, please give this matter the urgent attention it deserves as I am in dire need to leave this country.  Kindly send me your private phone and fax number for easy communication.

Best regards,
Mr.Mazuri Martins  (For the Family)

This fund arose from the overinvoiced of various contracts awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago.    We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, weremandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts.     However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in Morocco (North Africa), but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting tha the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.      We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fullyremitted into your nominated bank account.

Abdul Lawal <abdullawal_01@msn.com>,,"Wed, 15 Feb 2006 19:23:09 +0000",FROM MR ABDUL LAWAL (HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU),"FROM MR ABDUL LAWAL
STANDARD TRUST BANK OF BENIN
REPUBLIC OF BENIN.
WEST AFRICA.

DEAR FRIEND,
I am MR.ABDUL LAWAL,the director in charge of auditing and accounting
section of standard trust Bank of Benin republic in West Africa with
due respect and regard.

i have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be
very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who
died on 30th january 2000 on Kenya Airways with aircraft Airbus
310-304 at location Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with registration number
5Y-BE while travelling with his entire family, his wife, two children
and a maid on a festive visit to Abidjan and since his untimely death
the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any
claim of the fund in our ustody either from his family or relation
before our discovery to this development.

Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and
partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and
successful during the time of execution. The said amount was USD$24.1M
(twenty four Million one Hundred Thousand united states dollars).

may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through my
good friend who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business
relations here in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your person
to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such
magnitude without any problem.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the
bonafide next of kin to the deceased and get the required approval and
transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place, all
directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as
you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also
benefit yourself to this great business opportunity.In fact i could
have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country
as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account
and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of
transfer because i work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow
who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also
present a foreign account where he will need the money to be
re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification
and clarification by
the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be
remitted from
to your own designated bank account.

May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free
as i have made all arrangements for a successful transaction as an
insider of the bank before contacting you.On smooth conclusion of this
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as
gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of any
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer like telephone
bills, fax and our travel tickets to come over to your country for the
sharing of the fund while 60% will be for me and my partners.
Please you have been advised to keep this a top secret as we are still

Email: egwu18@hotmail.com

ATT: MANAGING DIRECTOR|C.E.O

Sir|madam
I know you will be surprise to read from me, more so when
it came from a stranger. But please consider this letter as
a request from somebody in dare of assistance.
Firstly, I must introduce myself, I am lt. Col. Richard Egwu the
former personal security to the late president
Laurent Kabila of the democratic republic of Congo (DRC)
formerly Zaire. I am presently in the republic of South
Africa as an asylum seeker.
I got your contact address from a business directory in
Johannesburg chamber of commerce and industry and after
going through your profile,I decided to solicit for your
assistance to transfer the sum of US$ 25million (Twenty-five
Million United States Dollars) into your company or
personal account for investment purposes outside Africa.
Before his death, late president kabila was aware that
rebels will not leave any stone unturned in their attempt
to remove him from government hence he started looting the
countrys treasure.
In May 2000, he directed me to oversee the movement of a
certain box marked diplomatic documents into Zimbabwe but
I decided to divert the box into the republic of South
Africa where I found out that the box was actually
containing the sum of US$ 25 million (Twenty-five million
united states dollars). I therefore deposited the box
containing the fund into a security and finance company here in
Johannesburg. I have been in hiding since then but with the
recent death of president Kabila I therefore decided to
transfer this money out of Africa for investment.
>From the above, you will understand that my life and that
of my children depends on the fund as such, I will be
grateful if you can assist me. I am now living in the
republic of South Africa, as a political asylum seeker with
my family and the financial rules and regulations of South
Africa do not permit me financial right to such huge amount
of money.
In view of this, I cannot invest this fund in South Africa,
hence I am prepared to offer you 20% of the total sum for
your assistance, while 10% will be set aside for unforeseen
expenses and 70% will be for me and my family's investment
in your country with your assistance.
Please call me on the above telephone or email
me to signify your interest in this transaction.

Thanks and God bless you for your anticipated co-operation.

Mr.Cheung Pui
Hang Seng Bank Ltd
Sai Wan Ho Branch	
171 Shaukiwan Road
Hong Kong.
 

Good Day,

Compliments of the season to you and your family.Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured business suggestion for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Bassem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration of four years (4yrs) the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem ,all that is required from you at
this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been
made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall negotiate our sharing percentage and agreed on it.

Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address  and I will prefers you to reach me on the email address below  (pui1900@business1.com)  and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be
appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Mr. Cheung Pui

+27 73 260 3786
Dear Sir, 
I should appreciate your surprise while receiving this letter. In any
case,I am left with no option but to contact you in this manner. my
decision to
write to you was informed by knowledge that being established personally
that you could be disposed to understand my predicament in order to give me
the assistance I require I am Frank Siaka the son of a late Sierra-Leonian
businessman, late Dr.Coleman Siaka the owner of (RMS) Mining Company in
Sierra-Leone, who died few years ago when the Revolutionary United Front
Rebels (R.U.F) attacked our residence on the 11 of Feb. 2004 in Makeni
Sierra-Leone.
Following the cease fire agreement which was reached last year with the
help of United Nation peace keeping troops, I used the opportunity to leave
the country with a very important document of (US$ 7,650,000.00) Seven
Million Six Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars, deposited by
my late father in Security Company in South Africa, under my name. This
money was realized from diamond export, now I and my mother are seeking
asylum in South Africa under (UNHCR).
I contacted you because of the need to deal with person whom my family and
I have no previous personal relationships, and I confirmed your country as
being economic conducive for investment and her people as transparent and
trust-worthy to engage in business, hence my reason for writing you
however, this money in question has been in the security company since his
death. But my main problem now is that at my age of 28yrs, I am confused on
how to handle this huge amount of money and also what to do with it as I
don't have anyone to confide in South Africa here. May I use this medium to
request from you if you will be disposed enough to help me keep this huge
amount in your country or any other place of your choice that will have
more security to the money and the life of me and my family?
I have met the security company with the depositional documents that my
father left behind, of which my name appears as the ""Next Of Kin, the
company awaits my coming for the withdrawal, and I am even afraid of
disclosing the content to them since my father in his letter had warned me
against that.
If it appeals to you to help me, I will suggest you take a trip to South
Africa for us to meet face to face and finalize before moving the fund or
if there is any other means you can suggest for the transferring of the
fund to your very position pending my arrival to meet with you for
investing of the money with any profitable business you introduce, as I
have decided to do away with Africa entirely.
I want immediate confirmation of your through our e-mail address. As soon
as I get your response I shall give out more details on how we shall
proceed. Kindly keep this proposal strictly confidential because of our
present status here in South Africa.
Thanks and remain blessed. I wait to receive a favorable response from you
urgently.
Yours faithfully, 
Frank Siaka

Unfortunately they All lost their lives in the event of the accident,
Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my

Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I 
contacted you. I contacted you to assist in retrieving the money and 
property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit were lodged.
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about 
US$10.5M (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United Stated 
dollars).Consequently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the next of 
kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccessful in 
locating the relatives for over 2 years now.
I seek your consent to help me in the search of the next of kin of the 
deceased or will you accept the offer to stand as the next of kin Since you 
are from the same country, so that the proceeds of this account valued at 
US$10.5MD can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. 50% to 
me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for expenses or tax as your 
government may require. I have all necessary legal documents that can be 
used to back up any claim we may make.
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through 
and
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. Please direct your reply 
through this alternative mailbox if you are interested to enable us discuss 
further.

I am interested in your partnership in a business transaction. This business proposal I wish to intimate you of will be of mutual benefit to the both of us and it?s success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality.

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committe of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account.

The fund came up as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.

As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided account.

On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.

1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary

2. 80% of the fund will be for Us.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction within the next few working days of commencement. For further details as to the workability of this transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification. Please, call me on receipt of this mail on TEL: +31 612 932 685
Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.

Barrister Martinez Obe. <obemm41@yahoo.com.hk>,R@M,"Sat, 31 Mar 2007 09:30:23 -0400",I AM IN LOVE,"One with Christ, 
It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,knowing the truth and the truth have set me free.Having known the truth, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God?s mercy and glory upon my life. I have the pleasure to share my testimony with you, having seen your contact from the Internet.
I am Barrister Martinez Obe, the legal adviser to late Mr.and Mrs.Grieves Martins a British couple that lived in my Country Nigeria for 25 years before they died in the Bellview plane crash . They are good Christian, They so dedicated to God but They had no child till they died. 
Throughout their stay in my country, They acquired a lot of properties like lands, house properties, etc. As their legal adviser, before their death, They instructed me to write their WILL. Because they had no child, They dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, the properties have to be sold and the money be given out to a ministry for the work of God, Orphanages and less privilegdes ones. As Their legal adviser, all the documents for the properties were in my care.
They gave me the authority to sell the properties and give out the fund to the Ministries for the work of God. 
In short, I sold all the properties after their death, as they instructed And as matter of fact, after I sold all their properties, I realized more than $10,000,000.00 (Ten million US dollars plus),and what supposed to be the percentage interest of my right legal fee was firstly deducted by me out of the total amount realized from the sold properties, this was base on the initial agreement between me and the owner of the properties before their death. 
Therefore the total amount left to be invested into God's work as instructed by the owner, is $10,000,000.00 (Ten million US dollars) only. But Instead of giving the main fund out for the work of God as instructed to me by the owner before their death. 
I converted the fund to myself with the intention of investing the fund abroad for my personal use. I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, because I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money. I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited the consignments with a security company. I did not want the management of the Security Company to know the content of the consignments; therefore I registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security company believes that what I deposited with them was Gold Bars. 
I had encounter with Christ when Rev. Billy Graham was preaching on television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts 5:1-11. After hearing the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian. As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible and one day, the Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19 where the word of God says: ""When the righteous truth from his righteousness, and committee iniquity, he shall even die thereby. But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby"". From the scripture, I discovered that the only way I could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as instructed for the work of God by the owner before her death. 
I have asked God for forgiveness and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by the owner before her death. After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to a honest Christian but after my fervent prayer over it, then you were nominated to me through divine revelation from God, so these are how I received such a divine revelation from the Lord, how I got your contact information, and I then decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of God. 
I have notified the Security Company where I deposited the consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad and the security company has since been waiting for my authority for the consignment to leave my country and move to abroad. You should also forward to me your telephone and fax number for easy communication and to fax you the documents concerning the consignments. 
prompt response will be highly appreciated.you can contact me on my secured e-mail address martinezobe84@keromail.com 
Yours in Christ
Barrister Martinez Obe.

RE: TRANSFER OF USD20,500,000.00(TWENTY MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) TO A SAFE ACCOUNT.

Sir,

It is my warmest pleasure writing you this confidential business offer 
irrespective of the fact
that we have not met before or done any thing that will re-impose 
absolute confidence but nevertheless, an adage says a day begins a story
 and it is in line of this strong perspective that I am very determined 
to communicate you with much conviction that you will give my proposal a
 second thought and consideration.

As earlier stated I am Mr Daniel Amachree a General Manager Finance 
working with Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas {NLNG}. My Agency is to 
produce and export NLG and NGL safely, reliably and profitable, and grow
 business to it full potential, helping to put out flares in Nigeria and
 by the virtue of my unique position in office as the General Manager 
Finance. I was elevated by the commission to become the chairman of 
foreign contract tender board committee whose responsibility is to award
 and supervise foreign contract to ensure it is executed promptly.

Consequently, I the chairman of the tender board committee in 
collaboration with two other top
committee members over-invoice certain contract for the supply of 
Petroleum Pipe, Computers. The initial cost of the contract was pegged 
at US$60 million, but after the feasibility study that was done, while 
submitting my report to the office of the presidency for final approval,
 we deliberately inflated the cost to an excess amount of US$ 20..5 
million making the cost to be US$ 80.5 million.

Right now, the gist of contacting you is we are constrained to claim the
 fund due to certain laws
enacted by the government guiding civil service code of conduct Bureau 
which prohibits top civil
servants working under Government establishment from operating offshore 
or foreign Account and this situation has kept us in a fix to openly 
come forward to claim the outstanding balance of US$20.5  million, hence
 after series of private meetings we decided to make contactin order to 
get a reliable foreign partner whom we will forward his or her 
credentials to claim the fund based on mutual  trust and agreement.

In a nutshell, we need your assistance and support to claim this fund so
 that at the later time convenient for us, we will come over to your 
country after the funds have been transferred to meet you and collect 
our own percentage while you will keep the rest as yours.

For your support and total dedication to realize the objectives of this 
operation, you shall be entitled to 20% of the sum total, 5% for 
misslaneous expense like telephone bill, while 75% of the fund belongs 
to the three officials involved in the deal.


Note, you are vividly assured that you will not be subjected to any kind
 of risk for your support and involvement in this venture hence we have 
piloted a good strategy to ensure the operations goes smoothly of which 
we have targeted two weeks duration to accomplished our Aim.

Kindly treat this matter Absolutely confidential because the officials 
involved are still in serviceand some of us intend to resign our 
appointment immediately after the transaction is finalized.

I look forward to hearing positively from you while further details will
 be given as soon as I get your response , forward your telephone number, fax number
and mailing address for through which further correspondence will be made ,
as soon as i receive your reply .

so to be double sure of this act. After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to track a trust worthy person abroad over the Internet,hence I contacted you.


I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property

left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Security Company where this huge deposits were lodged, particularly the Impex Security Company,where the deceased had an account valued at about USD$16million dollars has issued me a notice that in the event that no next of kin comes up for the claim,the account

will be confiscated in three months time from now if not claimed .


Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years

now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued

at USD$16million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% shall be for me and 30% for you while 10% is earmarked for expenses

that will be incurred  during the process of Transfer of the fund.

MR. BRIAN SMITH <briansmith650@adinet.com.uy>,,"Mon, 10 Jul 2006 21:56:34 -0300",URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED,"URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED
FROM: BRIAN SMITH

Dear friend,

I am Brian Smith Esq, my client is one of the top Managers of Midland 
Bank London Branch and his colleague in the same bank here in the 
United Kingdom have an urgentand very confidential business proposition 
for you. On June 6th, 2001, a Chinese business man, Mr.CHOW LIU, 
deposited in his personal safety deposit vault currency valued at 
£17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million, Five Hundred Thousand British Pound 
Sterling) in my client's branch.  Upon expiration of the period of 
leasehold of his safety deposit vault two years ago, my client sent a 
routine notification to 
his forwarding address but got no reply.

Some months ago, a reminder was sent and finally it was discovered he 
had passed away. On further investigation, it was discovered that he 
did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were 
fruitless. Further investigations revealed that Mr. CHOW LIU did not 
declare 
any next-of- kin in all his official documents in my clients' bank. 
This sum of £17,500,000.00 is still in the Vault which was opened and 
the keys changed upon the expiration of the period of leaseholdby 
myclients.  Consequently, my proposal is that myclients will like you 
as a 
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. CHOW LIU. 

This is simple. I will like you to provide me immediately with your 
full names and address so that by virtue of my position as an attorney, 
I will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put 
you in place as the next of kin.  I shall do the drafting and 
notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter 
of probate/administration in your favor form the shipment of the funds 
through a courrier company to you. The money will be shipped by courier 
to you for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and my clients and 
20% for you. 

I hope that is okay.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for 
this transaction will be done by me as an attorney and the position of 
my client as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of 
this transaction. If you areinterested, please reply immediately via 
email:- brian_smith650@hotmail.com  If on the other hand you are not 
interested please disregard this mail and I will not contact you 
again.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with my phone 
number, more details of the transaction and the relevant documents that 
will help you 
understand.

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be restassured that this 
transaction would be most profitable for all of us.

Best regards,
Brian Smith (Esq).

I am Barrister Vincent Usman a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr.
John Anderson a foreigner, who was a contractor to Shell Petroleum
Development Company in Nigeria(SPDC). On the 26th of September 1992, my
client, his wife and their three children were involved in a Plane crash on
their way to Yankari Games Reserve for 2week`s holiday.

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the plane crash, Since then I
have made several enquiries to his Embassy and the home address he filled
in his file in my office to locate any of his extended relatives, this has
also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I
decided to use the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no
avail, hence I contacted you.

I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable
by the SECURITY & FINANCE HOUSE where this fund is deposited. Particularly,
the FINANCE HOUSE where the deceased had an account valued at about US$9M
(Nine million dollars). Conseqently, the bank issued me a notice to provide
the next of kin or have the account confiscated.

since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 10 years
now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased
since you are a foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at
US$9M can be paid to you and I. We shall share the money thus 55% to me and
40% to you, while 5% will be used to re-imburse any expenses that might be
incurred on both ends and to service the tax that might incur be in your
country.

I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any
claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us
seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a

Huge sum of money running into millions of United 
States Dollars was budgeted by the then Military Government for the 
successful organisation of this competition. 

In the same vein, the FIFA 
President Mr. Joseph (Sepp)Blaster donated some millions of Dollars for the same 
project, not to talk of Corporate bodies, Organisations and Football loving 
individual as the Deputy 
Secretary to both the Local Organising Committee (LOC) and the 
Nigerian Football Association (NFA), I and some of my 
colleagues in sensitive position were able to Over -Invoice most of the 
contracts, 
construction and refurbishing of the 8 stadia,Press Conference 
Rooms,Communication facilities and all other infrastructures used for the 
competition.The contractors who handled these projects had been 
paid off. 

I wish to inform you that the sum of US$18.5 million was realised as a result of 
Over-Invoicing after the successful 
competition and the said sum is presently lying in my 
Organisations (NFA) coded account with the Central Bank of 
Nigeria,ready for transfer into an overseas account of our choice.It 
might interest you to know that the New Civilian President of Nigeria has 
ordered that all Debt owned to foreign contractors should be paid 
immediately in order to woo more foreign investors into Nigeria. 
In the light of the above, I has been mandated by my 
colleagues to seek for an honest and trustworthy foreigner who will 
assist us in ensuring the successful Transfer of the above sum into 
his Personal/Companies Account. 

All necessary modalities/plan is duly worked out accordingly, you the 
account owner will be entitled to 20% of the Total fund while 5% will 
be used to settle any expenses that might be incurred by both parties 
and 75% will before me and my colleagues. 

You might be surprised and curious on how I got your 
detail in particular,it is courtesy of the Chamber of 
Commerce,Mines and Industry. 

All we require from you is your Co-operation as this Transaction is absolutely 
risk-free. 

We kindly request that you handle this transaction with utmost secrecy.We are 
hoping to develop a good 
business relationship with you.

Dearest one,
 
Permit me to inform you of my desire to go into business relationship with you , l got your name and contact through the internet here in Abidjan and I prayed over it and selected your name among other names due to the nature of my proposal,which requires a reputable and trustworthy person. Someone who will be kind and sincere to me.
 
l am Miss Lilian Thomas, the only daughter of late Mr and Mrs Nelson Thomas.My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in Abidjan here, the economic capital of Ivory Coast, he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their business meeting. My mother died on the 20th october 1988 and my father took me so special because l am motherless. 
 
Before the death of my father on 29th november 2003 in a private hospital here in Abidjan, he secretly called me on his bedside,when I sat down to listen to him, he started crying, why? (1) He complained that I am too young to be managing my life with no one to take care of me,(2)That I have not finished my university education as he planned for me, he revealed to me that he has a sum of US$8.400.000.(EIGHT MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) left in a security company here in Abidjan, that he used my name as the only daughter for his next of kin in deposit of the funds. 
 
He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisioned by his business associates , that l should seek for a GOD fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where l will transfer this money and use it for proper investment purpose ,that I must finish my university education by the help of a business partner abroad,that he or she should help me obtain a resident permit in his or her country.He also gave a standing instrution to the company that the
deposit must be transferred outside this country. According to my father,the money was deposited as art works to avoid attracting attention to the deposit. 
 
Sir, I am now ready to do all these since my father my bread winner is no more. Sir l am honourable seeking your assistance in the following ways. 
 
(1) To serve as my guardian in your country while I will depend on your expert advise since l am a girl of 23 years.
 
(2) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country in order to further my university education and to secure a residential permit for me in your country.

Moreover sir, l am willing to offer you 15% of the total sum as compensation for your assistance in the transfer of this deposit to your country. Furthermore, you can indicate your option towards assisting me as l believed that this project would be concluded within seven days you signify interest to assist me by contacting the security company. 
 
Hoping to hearing from you soon. May God bless you as you extend your helping hand to the needy.
 
Best wishes
 
Lilian Thomas.

MRS MARY SANKOH <sank_mary6@popmail.com>,R@M,"Sun, 29 Jun 2003 01:33:59 -0700",urgent response,"STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

My Dear Friend,


I am highly compelled upon strict recommendation, to write you this very 
urgent and confidential letter.I do hope my letter will not embarrass you since I had no previous correspondence with you.I hope this mail will not come to you as a surprise.
I am sending this proposal with due sense of humanity, responsibility and with few awareness that you will give it a sympathetic attention. I regret to the inconvenience it may cause you base on the condition that we have not met before.

I wish to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you, I am Mrs Mary Iddo Sankoh,the wiife of the former minister of Diamond Mining Corporation in my country Sierra Leone in West Africa,My husband had a bullet shot by the rebels on his way travelling to Lusia a city after Freetown the capital along with my daughter, My daughter died on the spot while the U N peace keeping force rescued my Husband, he was taken to hospital for medical treatment which he later died about three months now. 
Fortunately, My Husband has Ten million and Five hundred thousand United States Dollars(US$10.5 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. This money is kept with private security company in Europe since two years ago. It is only my son and myself that know where the money is kept and has the documents for it.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning government�s vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer the ownership of this fund to you so that you can asisst us to claim it and used for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband. My family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation
of public funds during his regime.

Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying out financial transactions without their express permission is in force. Right now, my son and myself have concluded plans and decided to  take immediate claim of this fund so that we can use it to better our lives and alliviate our present suffering hence this contact.
However, I have an arrangement on how you can help us to recieve this money after receiving some assurances from you. The money personally belongs to my husband and he intended that it still be used for investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, neither is the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation concerning the funds in the Federal
Treasury. 
Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we propose a commission of 20%(Twenty Percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped out for miscellaneous expenses.

On your positive consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss about
this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, while I await your prompt response.

Best regards,

MRS. MARY IDDO SANKOH/ABDUL SANKOH

Compliment of the day, I JULIET UGAGA, The daughter of late General  KuJI UGAGA of the Democratic Republic of Congo.im married with two children.
 My father was a General in the Congolese Army. In his position (My father) with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent kabila, he was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms  internationally in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.
 Meanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the  sum of US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious  stones while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for  the Congolese Army. My father went home for the funeral of the late president, but on  his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my  father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However,one  of our
numerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father  was able to reveal this secret to me and advice that we should proceed to  the Netherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant  documents that
will enable me claim the box from the security company.Already, I have  made my first visit to the security company and the document entitled to  clear this money is with a finance security company in Holland.
 On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for  political asylum; which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort  on the best way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised
that we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a profitable venture. This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.
  Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through your account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the totalsum, 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the courseof concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me and  my family.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
VERY URGENT REPLY REQUIRED
I am DR AHMED SANI, I am a lawyer. I was the personal 
attorney to MR Josef Flubacher (hereinafter refered as my
client) from Zurich,Switzerland,who  was a contractor to Nigerian Government . 

On the 21 of April 2001, MR Flubacher was involved in a fatal road accident and died 
on the spot with his wife and two kids. 
Since then I have made several enquiries to the EMBASSY to locate any of my client's 
relatives or next of kin, this has also proved unsuccessful. I was appointed his trustee 
and sole admnistrator of his estate which includes his Bank Account.

I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money  left behind by
my client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this
deposit was lodged. 
Particularly the Global finance and Security company based in Amsterdam, Netherlands,
where he  deposited  $20 million dollars ( Twenty million dollars ) have issued me
a notice to provide the next of kin. 

I seek your consent and permission to present you as the next of kin so that the
proceeds  valued at $20 million dollars can be paid to you  and 
then we can share the money. 65% to me  while 30%  to you. Then the balance of 5% will be
reserved for incidental expences.
 
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up this transaction.
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.
I am very sure with your trust and asistance, we will successfully and legally transfer
this money to you before the finance company take any decision about it. 

 I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will  protect both party from any breach of the law.You will be giving all
the deposit documents to contact the finance company in Holland for clarification and verification of this matter.

Please get in touch with me through my email or fax as stated herein and send to me your
telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this transaction. 

I hereby attach the CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT as his trustee and sole administrator
of his estate.   
Please contact me immediately through my email:ahmedsani@myself.com and mohdsule@fsmail.net	
Note however, that your nature of business,sex or country of origin will not be
a hindrance for you to act as his next of kin.
Finally, I trust you keep this information private and confidential.
This money shall be transfered through telegraphic online banking procedure.
Truth,trust,and cofidence quaranteed

Ms.Aminata B.Kabila <ami_kabila@yahoo.com>,R@S,,I NEED YOUR URGENT REPLY,"
Good day
 
I know this mail might come to you as surprise but kindly allow me the 
opportunity of introducing myself. I am Ms. Aminata Bobi Kabila; 
daughter of  the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasa 
(former 
Zaire), Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila. 
I got your particulars through the South African Chamber of Commerce; 
However, i am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on 
this 
confidential business proposal with full financial benefit for both my 
family and you.
 
Before i go into further details, please be informed that i am writing 
without any other perso(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this 
transaction. Therefore i will appreciate same attitude to be maintained 
all through. I have the sum of USD8.5 Million from a secret sale of 
Diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body 
guards 
(Rashid) on January 16th 2001. The essence of this mail is to ask you 
to stand as my foreign partner and receive the fund on my behalf as i 
can not do much on my own due to security reasons, my narration below 
will explain better. Before i continue, be well informed that your 
share 
in this transaction has been calculated at 30% of the total sum, 5% for 
expenses that may be incurred if any and the rest for my family and me.
 
My father as an African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having 
married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my 
father, my step-brother Joseph, who is the current president of my 
country, 
is the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about 
this deal.
 
Already president Joseph is using his power to colonise all the money 
and private property which our father left behind for the whole family. 
Now my mother, myself and my younger brother are left with nothing in 
the inheritance of my late father�s wealth. Our situation is seriously 
critical that we need your assistance to help us receive this fund for 
relocation overseas and for proper investment jointly between we and 
you. Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction 
because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that 
shows no direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present 
the 
money is in cash and is secured in a security company as family 
treasures.
I am waiting for your quick and favourable response, and in case you 
have any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me urgently.
 
Thanks,
 
Ms. Aminata B. Kabila.

GBENGA ALUKO <gbealuko@voila.fr>,R@S,"Fri, 25 Apr 2003 16:24:47 -0000",REF,"This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the
fact that we have not met.The message could be strange but real if you 
pay some attention to it.
Please accept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message of goodwill 
to you, I have to say that I have no intention of causing you any pains.

My name is SENATOR GBENGA ALUKO, the executive
Chairman Pension funds committee in the senate
of the federal Republic Of Nigeria. I am writing you 
to earnestly Solicit your assistance in helping to
receive some sum of money. I got your e-mail address on
the Internet while searching for a reliable and reputable
person to handle this transaction.

THE PROPOSITION: 
We have the sum of US$9,000,000.00 (Nine Million
Dollars) that we intend to transfer overseas through the assistance of
a foreign partner.This money came as a result of the 
unclaimed pension funds belonging to a British expatriate petroleum 
engineer with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Engr.John 
Bruno.
After all other pensioners have been paid their entitlements,
we deposited this unclaimed sum of US$9,000,000.00,with the Debt 
Reconciliation Committee. 

In a bid to make sure Engr.John Bruno gets his due,I sent a routine 
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,
we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, 
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Engr.John Bruno died,
from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that
he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of
kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Engr.John Bruno did not declare any kin or relations in all his 
official documents.This sum of US$9,000,000.00 is still sitting in an
account of the Debt Reconciliation Committee and the interest is being 
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will 
ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 2 (two) years,the money 
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody 
applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner
to stand in as the next of kin to Engr.John Bruno so that the 
fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some 
corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide
immediately your full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so 
that I can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will 
put you in place as the next of kin to Engr Bruno.

Upon this,we would then obtain the letter of probate/administration in 
your favor from a Federal High Court.A bank account in any part of the 
world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money 
to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio 
of 65% for me and my partners,30% for you and 5% for any expences 
incured,during the course of this transaction.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done at the high court and my position as the Chairman of the 
Committee guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.The 
fund shall be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down 
procedures governing transfer of funds.If you are interested, please reply 
immediately via my email address. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with
more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the 
transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured 
that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because 
I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address.

Thanks and regards,

Sen.Gbenga Aluko

MR. CHEUNG PUI

HANG SENG BANK LTD.

DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,

CENTRAL HONG KONG,

HONG KONG.

 



Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui 

director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I 

have an urgent business suggestion for you.



I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much 

embarrassment by contacting you through this means for 

a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to 

confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this 

medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands 

now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, 

and it is imperative for me to know your opinion



Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi 

Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business 

man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar 

months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several 

notice was sent to him, even during the war early this 

year. Again after the war  another notification was 

sent and still no response came from him. We later 

find out that the Major and his family had been killed 

during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.



After further investigation it was also discovered 

that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin 

in his official papers including the paper work of his 

bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time 

he was at my office that no one except me knew of his 

deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five 

Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying 

in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim 

it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws 

of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will 

revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if 

nobody applies to claim the funds. 



Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I 

will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of 

kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to 

receive his funds. 



WHAT IS TO BE DONE:



I want you to know that I have had everything planned 

out so that we shall come out successful. I have 

contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary 

document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , 

all that is required from you at this stage is for you 

to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that 

the attorney can commence his job. After you have been 

made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in 

for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary 

approval and letter of probate in your favor for the 

move of the funds to an account that will be provided 

by you.



There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we 

are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney 

will prepare all the necessary documents. Please 

endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters 

concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been 

transferred to your nominated bank account we shall 

share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% 

for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should 

you be interested please send me your full names and 

current residential address and I will prefer you to 

reach me via my private box, 



{che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.



Your earliest response to this letter will be 

appreciated.



Kind Regards,



Mr Cheung Pui.

                                              TOP  SECRET
I am  YUSUF ALI,the director in charge of auditing and accounting
section of BANK OF AFRICA,Ouagadougou Burkina faso West Africa with due 
respect and regard.I have decided to contact you on a business transaction 
that  will be very beneficial to both of  us at the end of the 
transaction.During our investigation  and auditing in this bank , my 
department came across a very huge sum of money  belonging  to a deceased 
person  who
died on July 2000 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his 
account
with this Bank with out any claim of the fund  in our custody either
from his family or relation before our discovery to this developement.

The said amount was EIGHTHEEN MILLION united states
dollars.($18000.000.00)Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put the
claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased;get the
required approval and transfer this money to a foriegn account  has  been 
put in
place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you  as
soon as  you indicate your  interest and willingness to assist us and  also
benefit your self to this great business
opportunity.

Infact i could have done this deal alone  but because  of my position
in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not  allowed  to
operate  a  oriegn account and would eventually  raise  an eye  brow  on my 
side
during  the time of transfer becuase i work  in this bank. This is the
reason why it will require  a second party or fellow  who  will forward
claims  as the next of kin to the bank  and  also present  a foriegn
account

where he will need the money  to be  retransferred into  on his request
as it may be after due verification and clarification by the
correspondent branch  of the bank where the  money will be remitted from to 
your own
designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this 
transaction  is 100%    risk
free.On smooth conclusion of this  transaction;you will be entitled  to 
30%of
the total  sum as gratification;while5% will be set aside to take care of
expenses that may arise during the time of  transfer   and also telephone
bills; while65%will be for me.Please;you have been adviced to keep  top
secret as i am still in service and intend to retire  from service
after we conclude  this deal with you.

I will be monitoring  the whole  situation here in this bank  until you
confirm the money  in your account  and ask  me to come  down to your
country  for subsequent sharing of the fund according  to  percentages
previously  indicated and further investment,either in  your country or
any country  you advice us to invest.All other necessary vital  information
will be sent to  you when i hear from you.

I  look forward to  receive your email .

>From Mr. Thomas Reardon,
Dear Friend,
Greetings to you and your family in the name of God.I
am personally contacting you in my search 
for a reliable and God fearing person and having
gotten your contact through prayers and 
painstaking efforts I have decided to seek your help
in carrying out my last wish .My name is Thomas Reardon,
 55 yrs old and  an American national who
lived in Iraq. Until recently I had investments in oil
and construction in Baghdad. Since the war started in
this country my life has been thrown into severe
mystery. I lost my wife and two children to bombs
dropped in the city. Today, Im in a hospital in China
with very fatal injuries and I have lost my ability to
talk. My doctors have indicated that my chances of
survival are very slim. I have therefore decided that
part of my fortunes should be distributed to charity
works to help victims of the war in sudan, iraq and
other war zones and the rest part held in trust by you
and use in  future for charity purpose. Before this
happened my business and concern for making money was
all I lived for. 
I never really cared about other values in life. But
since the loss of my family, I have found a  new
desire to assist helpless families and victims of
humanitarian crisis. Shortly after the first gulf war
I deposited the sum of  USD$8.5 million dollars  with
a financial company in Europe,given the complete ruin
and disorder in the country I have no knowledge of any
relative who would be available to help me carry out
this last wish.  Please I want you to help me collect
the deposit  from the company in Europe and distribute
it accordingly. I want you to use your discretion and
judgement to re-emburse yourself at the end of the day
for  all expenses you will incure during the
collection and distribution of funds. If you are
willing to help, please reply as soon as you can so we
can look at your reward and the things you need to do
to collect the money.
Lastly, A list of this orgainization you intend to
distribute this funds to will be highly appreciated.
Upon your reply I shall send you the certifiate of
deposit and ownership certificate that was issued at
the time I deposited the Funds with them. I will also
be sending to you my international passport upon your
reply.
May the good God bless you and your family. 
Endeavour to reply through my secured email address;
(thomasreardon@myway.com)
Thanks/ Regards.
Thomas Reardon,

Dear Friend and Partner,
I solicit your strictest confidence in this proposal. This is by virtue of it's nature as been utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce Foreign Trade Division.

The contract have been duly executed and commissioned but leaving the contract commission US$12.4M Dollars floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN ready for payment.

The funds resulted from connivance between our predecessors and the foreign contractors. The contractors have been duly paid their contractual entitlement US$81M Dollars but leaving the over-invoiced funds US$12.4M Dollars in CBN's escrow account. We are therefore seeking your assistance in the transfer of these funds out of this country by providing your company name and address to be registered as a subsidiary or afilliate of the real company that executed the contract so as to effect the ballance of the funds into your account as part of the executor.
This is necessary as we cannot use the help of a local contractor here since the job was executed by a foreign company. Hence the need for your assistance.

All logistics and modalities are in place to ensure the smooth conclusion of this transaction within the nest 10 to 14 working days of commencement after the receipt of your company name and address as stated above including your telephone/fax numbers for better communication.
These informations will enable us make the application and lodge claim to the concerned ministry and agency in favour of your company. It is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria corresspondent bankers around the World is going to be made in your name.

Finally, when the funds hits your account, I and my associates will come over to your country for the sharing purpose as outlined categorically clear below.

(ii)US$2M Dollars for you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds. 
(iii)US$.4M Dollars as an abstract projections for re-imbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incured during the process of the transaction.

ADDRESS: 121 NELSON MANDELA AVENUE, 
SANDTON, and JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.
email lilliandamba777@yahoo.com
  Attn: The Director/Owner, 

How are you? I know you may be surprised to receive this letter, please consider this letter as a request from a widower. Firstly, I am LILLIAN DAMBA the wife of Late MR.K.DAMBA who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South African Trade and Business Information services and I assure you that nobody knows about this transaction except me, my two sons. Before the death of my Husband. He took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$15 Million (FIFYTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) in a private Security Company, when He foresees the looming danger in Zimbabwe. 

This money was deposited as family valuables to avoid much demurrage cost from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of a new farm in Swaziland. The land disputes started when Zimbabwean President MR. ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to many killings by Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society.

In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my husband was one of the victims. It is on this background that My family and I,who are currently staying in South Africa as refugees decided to transfer my Husbands money to a foreign country since the laws of South Africa prohibits refugees from opening any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zones of South Africa. 

Please, I need your assistance to transfer this fund to your trusted overseas bank account. For your efforts and assistance, I have agreed to give you 30% of the total sum, while 5% is mapped out to re-imbrues all the expenses incurred in the course of this transaction and 65% will be for my family investment in your country. 

Note that this transaction is 100% clear and Risk-Free, as I have made every necessary arrangement for a successful deal. The only thing I solicit for is your total assistance to transfer this money, complete trust and assurance that my own part of money will be safe when transferred to your account. Kindly keep this business proposal highly confidential for security reasons. If you are interested in assisting me,send reply via the above email address or fax no and include your private phone and fax no. I will respond to you immediately. 
  Looking forward to your urgent reply, 
  Thanks and God Bless.

We cannot make this transfer on our own or in our names for the fact that we are civil servants (still in active service).

The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime in my country, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals.
The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. The money in question is ready for transfer into an overseas account, which we expect you to provide.
We have agreed that the money will be shared according to the ratio Stated below;
(i) 25% to the account owner (you).

(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us)incidental to the actualization of this project.
We will require from you:
a) Name and address of Company/Beneficiary, telephone and fax numbers.
b) Bank name, address, telephone and fax numbers and Details of the Account, which you are the only signatory that the money will be Transferred into. We do not mind if the account is a zero-based account or an account with no funds in it so long as it is functional for this purpose.
The above requirements are to legalize the claim for payment and transfer of the money to your account. Be informed that the reason we are sending you this letter is because we know that the only way to succeed is to seek the help of a foreigner. Your professional status is not a matter of hindrance in this transaction. Please, your assistance is highly solicited. We have no doubts at all that this money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal.
Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through the same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security. All expenses regarding the opening of an account if not already in existence shall be borne by you, all expenses is however reimbursable on the conclusion of this business transaction.

How are you and your family today? I hope that you are all okay? I found
information about you and decided to contact you for an important
assistance. I am Michael Nkomo a citizen of Zimbabwe , but i am 
contacting
from a neiboring country here in IVORY CAOST where i am now
sicking political assylum.

I am the only son of Kenneth Nkomo, a wealthy farmer and senior 
politician
with the opposition political party in my country, Movement for 
Democratic
Change [MDC]. My father was murdered by our wicked
President, Robert Mugabe and I fled my country because I have become his
next target to eliminate.

My father was a fighter for Justice and a moving force in the MDC, a 
part
wanting to end the several years of brutal dictatorship government of
President Robert Mugabe. You will read more stories about President
Mugabe's brutal acts by visiting this web sites; 
http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html 

My father was accused of Treason and also assisting the White farmers in
fighting the government. Few weeks after his arrest, he was reported 
dead.
The government claimed he died of heart attack and his body was never 
seen
for proper autopsy, they buried him in the government cemetery. My 
father's
associate Mr. Martin Olds a White farmer from Britain assisted me in
fighting my father's death through the
Court and media; the government saw us as a big treat to them and 
decided to
eliminate us. Mr. Olds was attacked and murdered in his house, but
fortunately, before they came looking for me, I received the news and I 
had
to flee through the border to South Africa to save my life. My arrival 
here
in IVORY COAST still remains like a miracle to me.

Here, is my reasons for contacting you, I am having a huge sum of money
in
the total sum of $13.6Million presently lodge with the security company 
in
holland,My father kept this money in in two trunk boxes in disguise as
family treasures and could not bank them,
because of the situation in my country. My father's business, farms and
banks account were seized by the government before his arrest and murder.

He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in 
detention
and I have made several arrangements concerning the shipment of the 
boxes
out of my country because we cannot invest it there. I
was on the process when I fled the country. I need your assistance in
securing the funds there in your country, so that I can arrange on how 
to
come overto your country to invest with the fund I am willing to offer 
you
30% of the $13.6Million for your assistance.

Please, let me know if you can assist me, so that I can give you more
details on how we shall proceed. As I wait for your urgent response, 
please
treat this information as top secret.

Dear Friend 

I am Fadaka Randebe, Bank Official of Standard Trust Bank of
Nigeria , Adeola Odeku Branch. I have urgent and very
confidential business proposition for you. On June 6
1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the 
Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Jim Smith made a
numbered time (Fixed) deposited for
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd
that Mr. Jim Smith died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found
out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to
trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made
further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jim
Smith did not declare any next of kin in all his
official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian
Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jim
Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This
is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately
with your full names and address so that the attorney
will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,
which will put you in place as the next of kin. I
would also like you to scan you drivers license for
me.

We shall employ the services of two attorneys for

drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favour for the
transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk
at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch
official guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon
your response, I shall then provide you with more
details and relevant
documents that will help you understand. Please
observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that
this transaction would be most profitable for both of
us because I shall require your assistance to invest
my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via my alternative  email address. 

Thanks and regards, 

Fadaka Randebe.

Dear,

I am Dr. M. Z. Erick, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural
Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a
confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a
top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual
to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company
account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the
circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.

This amount (Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand) represents the
balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the
original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic
Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in
an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence
provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send
across to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%
of the Twenty-Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars, 70% for us
and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to
the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence
in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me
immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether
or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure
you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of
this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this
matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and
remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Dr. M. Z. Erick

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit




Dear Sir/Madam,

With a very desperate need for assistance, I have summed up courage to contact you.

I am  presently working in Iraq with American troop, I found your contact particulars in an address journal.

I am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of $17,000,000:00 (Seventeen million dollars) to your country or any other safe country of your choice, as far as I can be assured that my share will be safe in your care untill I complete my service here,this is no stolen 

money, and there are no dangers involved.

SOURCE OF MONEY. Some money in American currency was discovered concealed in barrels with piles of weapons and ammunitions at a location near one of Saddam's old palaces during a rescue operation, and it was agreed by all party present that the money be shared amongst us, this was quite an illegal thing to do, but I tell you what? no compensation can make up for the risks we have taken with our lives in this hell hole. The abovefigure ! was given to me as my share, and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a German contact working here, and his office enjoys some immunity, I was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of trouble spot.The German contact does not know the real contents of the package, and beleives that it belongs to an Asian American who died in an air raid, and before giving up, trusted me to hand over the package to his business associate.

I have now found a secured way of getting the package out to a safer country in Europe for you to pick up, and will discuss this with you when I am sure that you are willing to assist me.

One passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this matter with a third party, should you have reasons to reject this offer, please destroy this mail as any leakage of this information will be too bad for us. I do not know for how long we will remain here, and I havesurvived 2 suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and other reasons I will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help, I honestly want this matter to be resolved immediately.

Please contact me through my email so we can discuss more.

Respectfully,

Adams Allen

Attn
>From The Auditor/Head of Department
Bank of Scotland,
United Kingdom.                   {Very Urgent Business
Transaction}

Dear Partner,

In order to transfer out (fifteen-million pounds
sterling)from our bank here i have the courageto look for a
reliable and honest 
person who will be capable for this important
transaction,believing 
that you will neverlet me down either now or in future.I am
Mr Jim
Harry the auditor and head of computing department of a bank
here in 
London, united Kingdom. There is an account opened in this
bank in 1995 and since my inception into office in 2001,
nobody has operated on this account again, after going
through some old files,I discovered that if i do not remit
this money out urgently, it will be forfeited for nothing.

How the money came about:The owner of this account was Mr.
John Hughes who was a foreigner and the manager of Petro
chemical service here in London, a chemical engineer by
profession and he died since 1995.And then, since
2001,nobody knows about this account or anything concerning
it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that his company does not
know anything about this account and the amount involved is
(15,000,000.00)pounds sterling.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this 
money can not be approved to any local bank here in London,
but can 
only be approved to any foreign account because the money is
pounds 
sterling?and the former owner of the account is John Hughes
and he was a foreigner too.
Finally,at the conclusion of this business,you will be given
35% of the total ammount,60% will be for me ,while 5% will
be for expenses both parties might have incured during the
process of this 
transaction.Please you should include your phone and fax
number for 
easily communications.

Yours Sincerely,

Auditor Jim Harry

  ENGR ZULUMAKALENI.
  DIRECTOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION (MEMR) 
  DIRECT TEL NO: 0027 731 522 629 
  
  
 Dear Sir,

  
I am an Engineer with the South African Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources and I am also a member of the Republic of South Africa Contract 
Award and Monitoring Commitee in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources. It is a pleasure involving you in this project. Although, this 
may sound strange but I seek your indulgence and pray you view it seriously. 
 
Two years ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Ministry of 
Energy and Mineral Resources by my committee. This contract was over 
invoiced to the tune of US$14.3Million. This was done delibrately. The over 
invoicing was a deal by my commitee to benefit from the project. We now 
desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with the MEMR 
into any oversea account which we expect you to provide for us. 
  
For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be 
entitled to 30% of the money, 10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred 
by both parties during course of transfer, while the remaining 60%will be 
for my partners and myself. 
  
  I would require the following: 
  1)Bank details ( Name and address / Account no/Beneficiary name ) 
  2)Private Telephone and Fax number of Beneficiary 
  
The above information would be used to make formal application as a matter 
of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your 
account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract 
projects of this of this nature described here, the assumption is that your 
company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. 
More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields 
win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution 
of such contracts. We have strong and reliable connections, top government 
contacts at the South Africa Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance and we 
have no doubt that all this money will be released and transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the 
business is successfully concluded we shall through our connection withdraw 
all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% 
security. We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this 
opportunity. 
  
Please contact me immediately through my above Telephone or email contact, 
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will 
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But 
where you are interested, send the required informations aforementioned 
herein without delay as time is of essence in this business. 
I want to assure you once again that this transaction is 100% risk free 
both now and in the future. 
I await in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 
  
Yours faithfully, 

Engr.Zulu Makaleni.

unfortunate that Mr. Hamilton Creek died with all his family members. The reason
why I contacted you is this, Mr. Hamilton is dead and his only son whom
supposed to inherit his properties and money also died With him.

(Fifty two Million

United States Dollars) and it is the exact amount which late Mr. Hamilton Creek
has in his domiciliary Account  and this money is still in his account as
unclaimed money.

This transaction is very easy and simple and it is 100% risk free. I'm the
Director of International Relations with Access  Bank of Nigeria Limited and
the management/Board of Directors of the Bank are waiting for me to present to
them the Relation or next of Kin to late Mr. Hamilton Creek, which I told them
that I am still searching the next of kin to the deceased.

Finally, if you are interested with this transaction, I will present you to the
bank as the only next of kin to late Mr, Hamilton Creek and I will let the bank
to know that you are the only right person to inherit Late Mr. Hamilton Funds
and  properties, and his Money US$52M(fIifty two Million United States Dollars)
will be transferred into Your Own  Account as late Mr. Hamilton Creek next of
kin.

Email Address for immediate commencement so that late Mr. Hamilton Funds will
be credited Into your Account and all his Properties will be released to you

I apologies to take your value time to introduce this business proposal to you which I imagine will be of utmost benefit to us. I am the first and only son of the late environmental activist, a writer /publisher and a business man Chief Ken Saro Wiwa of the Ogoni land an oil producing community in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria, President and founder of Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), a non-violent action group.

My father died by hanging during the military regime of president General Sani Abacha (deceased) as my father was fighting for the right of his of people Ogoni land to have resource control over their resources but the government was so brutal until the gang up to kill my father .

Actually my father knew he was going to die due to the ugly situation since the government was against him. Prior to his untimely death, he wrote his Will that stated clearly that all his stocks /bonds, property and fund belongs to me. My father personal legal advisor Mr. Briggs conspired with the government to confiscate some of my father's fixed assets and frozen some of his account they were able to trace.

Right now, am seeking assistance from you to inherit the stocks and bonds, property and fund on my behalf and use it to set up a good investment for me in nearest future which I believe the dividend will be great. My father deposited the some of US$34.Million in a private security company somewhere in Europe which I have all the paper work as proof of ownership in my custody and no one else knows about this accept my mother.

After serving under the immediate past government of former president Olusegun Obasanjo as a minister in his cabinet. I am currently now undergoing a pastoral course in school of divinity. If you are sincerely interested and willing to help me in claiming this fund at the finance house in Europe and also capable handling a business of this magnitude kindly as a matter of urgency write me only through this email address: ken_sorowiwajr@excite.com and to know more about my father please, kindly visit www.remembersarowiwa.com

WORLD BANK FACT-FINDING & SPECIAL DUTIES OFFICE
DAKAR, SENEGAL.
TEL: +221 4183317
Email:Revduglas@yahoo.fr
Dear Friend. 
I am Revd. Fr. Thomas Douglas, a senior staff with the World Bank fact finding & 
special duties office.
I am writing you this letter based on the fact that cool penny 
is better than millions of dollars means it's better for one to live and die poor 
honest man than a rich dishonest one. 
I and the Chief security officer (CSO) of this organisation have arranged with an 
officer in the computer section the person of Engineer Peter Cliff to bring out part 
of your total pending payment with reference number (LM-05-371) amounting to US$10 
million. Why we did this is because according to information gathered from the bank�s 
security computer, you have been waiting for a long time to receive this payment 
without success. 
As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory 
requirements in respect of your pending payment. The problems you are having is that 
of interest groups. 
A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people 
are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different 
kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday. Also we found 
out that some of the officials of the parastatals have been extorting a lot of money 
from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this 
will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers. For security reasons 
you do not have to tell anybody that your have your payment on the way until the 
payment gets to you. 
The said payment is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to 
get this box shipped to you I and the (CSO) Yesterday went to this four courier 
companies Dhl, Ems, FedEx and Ups to make arrangements on how to get the box shipped 
to you by courier, but to no avail the above courier companies all made us to 
understand that they will have to open the box for inspection by the customs before 
shipment. 
This is something we want to avoid because this box is been padded with 
synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the 
button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open 
the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine. We told the 
courier services that the box contained film materials and when open will spoil the 
materials. we did not declare money because courier does not carry money. 
Today a friend of mine who is a diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security

30 VICTORIA STREET, 
JOHANNESBURG, 
SOUTH AFRICA. 
E-MAIL : barrykabila1@yahoo.com                               
                          

                                  HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL.
ATTENTION: 
 
You may be surprised to receive this message from me since you don't know me in 
person, but for the purpose of introduction, I am MR.Barry Kabila, the son of late 
MR.EKOHANA KABILA, who was murdered in a land dispute in ZIMBABWE. 

I got your contact through the South African International Exchange Network On-line 
here in Johannesburg, South  Africa as reliable and trustworthy to deal with,then I 
decided to write you. My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers 
murdered in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of President ROBERT 
MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition party. 

Before the death of my father, he took me to South Africa to deposit the sum of 
Twenty  Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars ($20.5m) with a security and finance 
company, as if he knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited as a 
gem or precious stone to avoid much demurrage from the security firm. 

This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the 
farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. 

This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE introduced a new land Act. which 
wholly affects the White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the 
'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob 
actions. 

I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa as a refugee or an asylum 
seeker have decided to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can invest 
it. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in South Africa for 
fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have the same 
political history. 

Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does not allow such investment hence I 
am seeking for and asylum or refugee. I must let you know that this business is 100% 
risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. So if you are 
willing to assist us,I and my family have agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 
35% will be for a joint business venture I will be doing with you and another 40% 
will be for me and my family which we shall also invest in your country and the 
remaining 5% will be mapped out for all expenses we may incurred during the 
transaction. 

Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render the needed assistance, 
endeavor to reply through my email address or the above.I also need your private 
phone and fax number for easy communication. Remember that this is highly 
confidential and the success of this business depends on how secret it is 
kept. 

Expecting your reply soonest. 

Best Regard. 

Mr.Barry Kabila.

Mr. Nasser Nasiri. <nassernasiri2003@uaemail.com>,,"Tue, 21 Oct 2003 16:09:07 +0400",CAN I TRUST YOU WITH THIS BUSINESS?,"Greetings from UAE

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL.

I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is more secured and private. I am Nasser Bin Nasiri, Director of Procurement and Contract Award with, Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources [MPMR]. I am contacting you concerning the transfer of US$43 Million Dollars (FOURTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS) 

Sometime ago, a contract was awarded by my Corporation, [MPMR] to a Japanese Firm, to carry out Turn Around Maintenance and rehabilitation work on Emirates Petroleum Products Company (EPPCO) This contract was over invoiced by us to the tune of US$43. Million {Forty Three Million United States Dollars).  Myself and my partner reached a compromise to transfer the
fund into a Foreign bank account that will accommodate
this fund. We have all modalities set.

We were disappointed last time by a US Senator, Late Paul Wellstone whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of $45 Million USD in 2001. They sat on our money for no apparent reason and was still holding our money until his family were killed in a plane crash last December.   We still believe
that good people still exist in this world and we are willing to try again with you, bearing in mind that God will all way fight for us.  

You can confirm the above transaction from Mr. Clarence Barnes, Uncle to the Senator, who provided the receiving bank account.  His email address is cbarnes@worldemail.com and phone 1-661-310-2112.   He is enjoying our collective money and refused to give us our share but we believe, he shall meet his doom as Senator did.  Because of this we are afraid and we need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and straight forward person.  We made a costly mistake with the Senator, by not going into agreement.

Based on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive position of trust, we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves without the assistance of a foreigner.  The process will not require your presence here in UAE.  I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. 

We intend to share the money in the following manner: 30% for you, 60% for us and 10% will be for any expenses incured during the transfer.  Contact me immediately if you are interested for further details.  We look forward to a fruitful business relationship with you and your urgent response. 

Best Regards, 

Mr. Nasser Bin Nasiri.

International Commercial Bank.
First Light Branch,
Accra - Ghana.
West Africa.

ATTN:My Dear,

My name is Mr. Michael Ezra. I am the accountant of the International Commercial Bank-Ghana, First Light Branch Accra. I am a Ghanaian married with three kids. I am writing to solicit your assistance in the noble transfer of US$14,800,000.00 (Fourtheen million, eight hundred thousand U.S.dollars). This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the accountant made as profit during the last year. I have already submitted an approved end of the last year report for the year 2005 to my Head Office here in Accra and they will never know of this Excess.I have since then, placed this amount of US$14,800,000.00 (Fourtheen million, eight hundred thousand U.S. dollars) on a SUSPENCE ACCOUNT without a beneficiary.

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account.

I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. It is going to be a bank-to-bank transfer to your nominated bank account anywhere you feel safer. All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund.

Frankly speaking I have been working in this bank for close to 10 years and I have nothing to show for it,my yearly income is barely about $3,500 USD after tax and the major reason I packaged this transaction is that I have a 9 year old daughter with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die. I have already made arrangement for this surgery in the UK but I could not afford it, so I really need your help to do this deal or my daughter will die.

I am offering you 30% of the total sum after this money is wired to your account, because it is a simple bank-to-bank inheritance claim transfer.I will also like you to get me rest assured that you will not abandon me when the money gets to your account.I have all the payment claim information worked out. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal Through.

Please i will like you to answer me this questions.
(1)Can a black man build a house in your country and invest there?
(2)Can a black man be given staying permit and be allowed to visit sight seen?
(3)Can i direct any company of my own?

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the trasfer.Your prompt response via my email is highly envisaged;your response will make me act accordingly upon the receipt of your mail. I will be waiting to hear from you for further guidelines. If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response.

Bye for now and thanks for your understanding.

Barrister Barnett Scott
Scott & Associates
London-England
barnett_scott@web2mail.com

I am sorry for contacting you through this medium without a previous
notice, I had to use the E-mail because it is an easier

and more confidential way of making contact with people around the world.
My name is Barrister Barnett Scott,a forty five (45)
year old Attorney in practice here in London-England. I had a client by
name Mr.Victor a contractor based in Sri-
lanka/Indonesia now deceased. My client lost his life alongside his wife
and only child in aceh sri-lanka. Details of this
incidence can be checked on the following
website;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4143487.stm
prior to the death of my late client, He secured a contract of
$12,500,000.00 million from the sri-lanka/Indonesia
government, following which he received a 30%mobilization fee of
US$3,750,000.00 Million and successfully executed the
contract, but the balance of US$8,750,000.00 Million contract payment was
in the Process of being transferred into my late
client's account which he submitted to the government when he lost his
life in the incidence.
Few days after his sudden Death,The government of Indonesia effected the
transfer of the balance of his Contract Funds into
the account that my late client has on his file with the government. As
his personal Attorney before his death,I have been
officially notified and instructed by the bank here in U.K where the money
is currently deposited that I should provide and
forward the particulars of Mr.Victor's next of kin so that the Funds in
his account can be remitted into his Next of Kin's
account in accordance with British Laws.

However, as the personal attorney and close confidant of late Mr.Victor, I
want you to know that my late client died
interstate, i.e, He died without leaving a Will.Hence,all my efforts to
locate any of his relative whom I can present to the
bank has proved abortive.
Therefore I am seeking for your consent to present you as the deceased
relative/next of kin and subsequently the beneficiary
of the fund so that the proceed of this account valued at US$12,500,000.00
Million can be paid to you for subsequent
disbursement between you and I. If you can cooperate with me and receive
this funds as next of kin to Mr.Victor, confirm your
interest by contacting me through my E-mail:- barnett_scott@web2mail.com
I can assure you that the deal is 100% risk free because i am in possesion
of the deceased personal file which contains all
information which I shall use to prove your relationship with the deceased
therefore the money will be paid into the account
of whomever I present as Mr.Victor's Next of kin with proofs that I will
present to the bank when needed.
When I receive a positive response and after proper discussion with you, i
will furnish you all relevant information that will
facilitate the release of the Funds to you. An Application will have to be
filed to the Bank for processing of the release of
the funds into your nominated bank account.

I wait to hear from you.

ATTN; 



DEAR 

I am writing to you with my personal respect and 

delight towards this urgent business transaction as 

at hand. But briefly, I am CYNTHIA AMAKA MOBUTU KONA. 

Iam the wife of former President of Republic Democratic of 

CONGO,(RDC)late President MOBUTU KONA, who died in 

exile as a result of military / Civilian problems (may 

his soul rest in peace).There was a deposit of $25

million USDollars, made by my late husband in one of 

the foreign private security and finance company 

overseas, which was registered as family valuables. 

Since then, there has not been good chance to make the 

withdrawal of the money.But recently, I instructed my 

uncle to make the withdrawal of the fund, so that we 

can be able to launch the business we have already 

proposed in establish in oversea. But latest information, I got 

from my uncle was that the deposit was made with a 

foreign name,that I should urgently source for a 

foreign! partner who will stand as the beneficiary of 

the fund, so that there will be an easy withdrawal. 

That all other documents for the withdrawal are very 

okay. But my condition and my possibilities makes it 

very difficult for me to approach any person for 

recommendation, as this business does not in any way 

requires public advertisement. That is my reason of 

contacting you for this very important assistance. Only 

I will not hesitate to giv you the 20 % of the total 

fund for assistance in this business. Be assured that 

there is no risk in this business. For there are many 

other discussions as regards the investment proposal of 

the fund. So, if you can be able to assist me,please do 

urgently reply me, and don�t forget to give me your 

telephone and fax number while replying this 

letter.Thank you and God bless.

 First Bank of Nigeria Plc.
 Lagos, Nigeria.
 Phone: 234-80-37142361.
 Alternative Email:judeigbo@juno.com		
 
 Sir,
 
 Compliment of the day and how is life general with
 you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and
 crave your indulgence to make this project request
 for
 a joint business transaction which I hope will not
 come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for your
 pardon.  
 I am Mike Igbo, the manager of headquarter first
 bank
 of Nig. Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and
 confidential
 business proposal for you. 
 
 On June 6, 1997, an Australian oil
 consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum
 cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Peter Bush made a numbered
 time
 (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued
 at
 US$25,000, 000. 00(Twenty-Five Million US Dollars)
 in
 my branch.
 
 On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
 forwarded address but got no reply after months we
 send a reminder and finally we discovered from his
 contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum
 Corporation) that Mr. Peter Bush died from an
 automobile accident. On further investigation, it
 was
 clear that he died without making a will. All
 attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin
 were fruitless.
 
 I therefore made further investigation and
 discovered
 that Mr. Peter Bush did not declare any next of kin
 or
 relations in all his official documents including
 his
 deposit document in my bank. The total sum
 US$25,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant
 acct.
 No one will ever come forward to claim it. According
 to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money
 will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
 Government. If the account owner is certified death
 and nobody comes forward to claim it.
 
 This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am
 looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the
 beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you
 have
 to do is to immediately send me the details of a
 bank
 account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the
 proper money transfer document. The money will then
 be
 transferred into the account for us to share in the
 ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining
 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with
 here
 and there.
 
 There is no risk involved. I am using my position
 and
 connection in the bank here to do all the document
 work for the transaction. We shall employ the
 services
 of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all
 necessary documents and letter of administration in
 your favor for the transfer. This transaction is
 risk
 free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply
 immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that
 this transaction could be most profitable for both
 of
 us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not
 interested because if you do, it will take me out of
 seat.
 
 I am awaiting your urgent reply.
 
 Best regards,
 
  Mike Igbo.

  Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. 
This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the ""modus operandi"" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. 
 precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. 
  As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an ""ASYLUM"". 
  As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. 
Finally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company's account in your country. 
 If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. 
Best Regards.
 
Jonathan Bongani(For the Family).

ATTN: Sir/Madam,

I know that this message will come to you as a surprise
since we don?t know each other, but for purpose of
introduction, I am DAVID MORGAN. The bank manager of
AMALGAMATED BANK OF South Africa (ABSA). There is an
account opened in this bank in 1982 and since 1990, nobody
has operated in this account again. After going through
some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do
not remove this money out urgently, it would be forfeited
for nothing. The owner of this account is MR. ADAMS
COLEMAN, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold company, a
geologist by profession and he died since 1990. 

No other person knows about this account or anything
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigations proved to me as well that his company does
not know anything about this account. The amount involved
is US$18m (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS). I am
only contacting you as a foreigner because this money
cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be
approved to any foreign Account because the money is in US
Dollars and the former owner of the account is MR. ADAMS
COLMEAN is a foreigner too. I know that this message will
come to you as a surprise as we don?t know ourselves
before. We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is
real and a genuine business. 

Please reply or call me urgently so that I will inform you
the next step to transfer this fund to your resident Bank
Account immediately. Send also your private telephone and
fax numbers including the full details of the account to be
used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or
sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you
can receive this money into a foreign account or any
Account of your choice where this money will be safe. And I
will fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and other
investments. 

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a
foreigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I
need your full co-operation to make this work fine because
the management is ready to approve this payment to any
foreigner, who has correct information of this account,
which I will give to you later immediately, if you are
capable and willing to handle such amount in strict
confidence and trust according to my instruction and advice
for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never
come again in my life. I want you to be truthful in this
business, because I don?t want to make mistake, I need your
strong assurance and trust. 

With my position now in the office, I can transfer this
money now to any foreigner?s reliable account, which you
can provide with assurance that this money will be intact
bending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately you
receive this money, leaving no trace to any place. You can
also come to discuss with me face to face after whom I will
make this remittance in your presence and two of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money
going into the account. 

I will apply for my annual Leave to get visas immediately I
hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this
fund in your account. I will use my position and influence
to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money
to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the
ministries and foreign Exchange departments. At the
conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the
total amount, 70% will be for me, and while 5% will be for
expenses both parties might Have incurred during the
process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest
reply through my e-mail or you give me a call through my
office line. 

Regards,

DAVID MORGAN. AMALGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA).

Greetings 

Dear Friend 

Please Permit me to contact you through this medium. I am Barrister Tunji Bello, a solicitor at-law. I was the personal attorney to one of my late clients that used to work with an indigenous company here in my country.In summer 2001, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in an auto-crash while on a picnic-trip. Unfortunately, all occupants of the vehicle lost their lives. 

Since then I have made several enquiries to his embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives and this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you over Internet. 

I have contacted you to assist in receiving and accommodating the money left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. My deceased client had an account balance with his bank valued at about US$9.9million, and I have been issued a notice as his attorney to provide his next of kin or have the account confiscated. 

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating my client's relatives; I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client so that the proceeds of his account (US$9.9million) can be paid to you. You and I can then share the money 60% to me and 40% for you. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this project through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate/risk-free arrangement that will protect you and me from any breach of the law. 

I await your positive response to my private email address at tunji_b333@yahoo.com as soon as you read this email. 

Best Regards, 

Barrister Tunji Bello

Chief Dr.Phil E.Bernard <philbernard2000@netscape.net>,R@S,"Fri, 21 Apr 2006 08:21:23 +0200",RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL,"ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO
Dear Sir,
I am Chief Dr. Phil E. Bernard, a native of Cape Town in South
Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the
South African department of Mining and Natural Resources.
Please accept my apology for using this medium to
convey a transaction/business of this magnitude, but
this is due to the confidentiality and prompt access
reposed on this medium. I have decided to
seek your co-operation in the execution of this deal
described hereunder, for the benefit of all parties
and hoping you will keep it as TOP SECRET because
of the nature of the business.
Within the department of Mining and Natural
Resources (where I work as a director), and with the
cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our
possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty Five Million,
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$45,500,000.00)
which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance
and cooperation of a company/or an individual to
receive the said funds, via a reliable Bank Account.
Quite frankly, we are handicapped as the South
African civil service laws (Code of Conduct Bureau) strongly
prohibits us from owning/or operating a foreign
account hence your importance in this
whole transaction.
This amount (US$45.5M) represents the balance of the
total value of a contract executed on behalf of my
department by a foreign contracting firm which we
the officials (involved) deliberately over-invoiced.
Though the actual cost have been paid to the
original contractor leaving the balance in the tune of the
said amount which we have in principle gotten approval to
remit by Key Tested Telegraphic transfer (K.T.T.) to
any foreign bank account you will provide by filing
an application through the justice ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges
of the former contractor to you.
I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction by way of providing the required
account in receiving these funds, your share of the
entire sum will be 30% amounting to Us$13.65Million
of the US$45.5Million, 60% amounting to US$27.3Million
for us and 10% amounting to US$4.55Million will be
used to settle taxation and other miscellaneous
expenses in the course of transferring the funds to your account.
The business itself is 100% foolproof
and safe, as long as you maintain utmost secrecy and
confidentiality. Further more your area of
specialization will not be a hindrance to the
successful completion of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not
disappoint me. Should you be willing to assist
positively with a common goal, endeavor to contact
me immediately through my above email address.
If you are not interested, please also indicate so
that it will enable me to contact other foreign
partner with recommendations to carry out this deal.
I want to assure you that my colleagues and I are in
position to make the payment of this claim possible
provided that you can give us a very concrete
assurance of the safety of our share. Please, always
treat this matter with utmost confidentiality,
because we will not comprehend any form of exposure as we
are still in active government service. Time is of
essence in this business, so kindly act fast.
I await in anticipation your fullest co-operation.
Yours Faithfully,
Chief Dr. Phil E. Bernard.  ",0,1

>From Mr.Jim Nelson,
# 41 Easton Street,
London WC1X 0DW, UK
Occupations: External Auditor

Attn;

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal
ethics although I wish to use this medium to get in touch with you first
because it's fastest means. I am a staff in the account section of a known
bank here in the United Kingdom.

In one of our periodic auditing I disproved a dormant account with holding
balance of £15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million British
Pounds) which has not been operated for the past three years. From my
investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account, a foreigner
by name Mr James Williams  died in July 19,2003 and since then nobody has
done anything as regards the claiming of this money because he has no
family members who are aware of the existence of neither the account nor
the funds.

I have secretly discussed this matter with a top senior minister official
of the federal ministry of  finance here and we have agreed to find a
reliable foreign partner to deal with us although due to his position he
did not want to take active part but as soon as you follow myinstructions
everything will be successful because we will be working hand in hand with
him.

We thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of
these funds from the deceased and after due legal processes have been
followed the fund will be released to your account without delay and we
will use it for investment and to assist the less privileged in the
society.This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund
is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry,
terrorism or any other illegal act. On receipt of your response I will
furnish you with detailed clarification as it relates to this mutual
benefit transaction look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible
if you are interested.

Regards,
Mr.Jim Nelson.

fund in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and
since 1998 nobody has operated on this account
again,after going through some old files in the

is Mr. Robert Chapman a Canadia and great
industrialist.  He was African Area Director of SIL
International, who unfortunately died in the plane

Chapman's company talked about his death in 
the Kenya crash. You shall as well find the pictures
of Chapman and his wife there.   

No other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that until 
his death he has a Gold/Diamond Consulting firm.I also
found out that their only surviving daughter died last
year. 

The total amount involve is ($35,000.000.00 USD) 
(Thirty Five Million United States Dollars) and we
wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners
account abroad. But I don't know any foreigner,

which I shall give to you upon your positive response.
I am revealing this to you with believe in God that
you will never let me down in this business, you are
the first and the only person that I am contacting for
this business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take urgently.

arrangement that will protect you from any breach of
the law.  The bank official Will destroy 
all documents of transaction immediately we receive

MR. JAMES NICHOLAS <jamesnicholas@zwallet.com>,R@M,"Mon, 15 Dec 2003 05:52:47 +0100",URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL,"Mr. James Nicholas
Calabar, 

Dear Prospective Business Partner,

I am e-mailing to you this business proposition having gone through your remarkable profile on the internet. Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest, surest and most secured means for me to communicate with you at this time.

However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such. Official telephone calls and fax messages to me WILL NOT be entertained for security reasons and for the success of this project. For further briefing, you can reach me only via my private email address as stated below or through my lawyer whose contact shall be provided to you
in due cause.

My name is Mr. James Nicholas. I am the chief financial controller to Mr. Charles Taylor, the ex-president of Liberia who is presently on exile in Nigeria.  As his private financial controller, I have access to his financial records more than any of his family members.

Mr Charles Taylor has over $1 billion dollars outside Liberia and his family members or people around him are not aware of this. With his present notion of arrest and following his restricted movement and the recent proclamation by Zurich authority, the U.N war crimes court and the America Government, has agreed that all Bank account belonging to Charles Taylor should be reported and freezed. 

Therefore I want to use this opportunity to make good money for myself. I have worked for him for over 10 years and I have nothing to show for it. I am only leaving on his empty promises and hopes.

Presently, I have complete information to authorize with documents for collecting /receiving $200 million from one of his financial sources in South Africa. And I need your assistance in receiving the funds in Europe on my behalf. Charles Taylor has prepared himself legally and secretly arranged with Top most Government agents to transfer the funds upon instructions.

In light of the above, I am seeking your cooperation to act as the authorized beneficiary of the said funds to enable us claim the funds for our mutual benefit. As you probably already aware, Mr. Charles Taylor maybe handed over by his host country to the new Liberia Government to face trial soon hence the need for urgent attention to this matter. 

Your prompt responce to my proposal will be highly appreciated. As soon as I receive your geniue intention to cooperate with me, I will have my lawyer provide you with the necessary details as required to enable us conclude this transaction successfully. I thank you and look forward to hearing from you shortly.

Regards

James Nicholas
please reply via my private e-mail below.
e-mail: jnicholas@zwallet.com 

..........................................

Because of charles Taylors notion of arrest, and with the present development the security alert-ness is higher, so I will introduced my lawyer to you upon your responce to my proposal.

philomina BURTLEY <philomina_2@yahoo.com.au>,aiweb06@cs.umbc.edu,"Wed, 24 May 2006 14:16:56 -0700",PLS GETBACK TO ME.,"I have a new email address!You can now email me at: philomina_2@yahoo.com.au

Dearest in the Lord,

 

I am the above named person from South Africa. I am married to Mr.GREOGE  SANKOH  who worked with South African embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. 

 

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.

 

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 5.5Million U.S.(FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDERD thousand Dollars) in a trunk box in one ( Security And Finance Company) in cote d' ivoire.Presently, this money is still with the Security And Finance Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next two years due to cancer problem.

 

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. 

 

I want a church that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.

 

I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. 


I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. 

 

I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.

 

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the BANK in ivory coast.

I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. 

 

Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. any delay in your reply will give me room in searching for a church or christian individual for this same purpose.

 

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you as soon as you received this mail .

 

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.


Yours in Christ.

murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact as I was searching

Reliable person to handle a very confidential business which involve a transfer
of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father

Zimbabwean opposition party rich farmers murdered by the agents of the ruling
Government of president Robert mugabe, for his alleged support and sympathy
for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority, Before
the death of my

father, he had taken to Johannesburg and deposited the sum of thirty eight
million united state dollars (U$38,000,000 with a diplomatic company in
South Africa, and transfer to NETHERLAND(EUROPE), as if he foreseen the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as valuable
items (photographic material) to avoid over taxed custom clearance. These
land problems arose when president Robert mugabe introduced a new land act
that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently condemned
the ideal. This result to rampant killings and mob action by the war veterans
and some political thugs, precisely more than three thousand( 3,000) people
have so far been killed. Heads of government from the west, especially Britain
and United States have voice their condemnation of Mugabe's plans. Subsequently,
south Africa have development community(S.A.D.C)has continuously supported

I have so far decided to undisclose these funds to the ""Federal government of nigeria pending my personal use.
I am desperately searching for a trustworthy individual who would help me receive this money in his or her account from H.S.B.C financial so as to start immediate investment opportunities.
I am sorry, I may not be able to leave nigeria at present due to the nature of my job and as a civil servant we not allowed to own a foreign account, but I would like to entrust this money in your care for urgent investment.

Compliments of the Day Permit me to introduce myself to you. My name is MR.MOSES
PARAISO,A top Management Official of the above Finance Corporation in Cotonou,
Benin Republic.

As it may intrest you to know, I got your contact through my international
business enquiry  as i was making contact of an foreign partner that will
assist me to bring this deal to be a success. I beleive you will be viable and
capable to champion a business of such  magnitude without any problem.

PROPOSITION: An Australian Engr Donald Pepper, a prosperous oil\\Gold merchant
had in our Bank the sum of $28.5million in a domiciliary account.
Unfortunately, he was killed in a recent ghastly motor accident in Benin
Republic. Efforts had been made by the management of my bank through the
Australian Embassy to contact any of the deceased children but to no avail. I
later discovered that he had no children. Given the skeletal information
available to the bank, it has so far been impossible to reach any of the
relatives.

The situation left for the Management is to declare the deceased account dormant
and revert the funds to trading for interest to the Bank. In order to avoid this
development, I now seek your approval to have you stand as a distant relative to
Engr Donald Pepper, so that the money would be released to you.
I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid
international passport or drivers license and foreign account.
Because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the account Engr
Donald Pepper,was a foreigner too.

All documents and proofs to enable you get the money will be carefully packaged
once I receive your acceptance on this proposal. I shall apply for a leave as
soon as the funds get into your reliable account to come to your country for
sharing and investments which you will assist me in doing. May I assure you
that this is safe and risk-free, as I have taken care of all necessary
modalities to ensure a hitch-free Transfer I have decided that upon the
conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to 30% of the total Funds I
have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.
For us to proceed please send to me your full Location Address, telephone and

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as i am  using the only secured  and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business.I am Mr JOHN DUF from the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB), DAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch. 
 This business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with  Petroleum Corporation, Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,500,000.00(TEN Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the  Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Barbara .A.

On further investigation, I found out that she died without making a  WILL and attempts to trace har next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to AFRICAN law, at the expiration of (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGAL Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill so that the fruit of this old woman's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.

Joeltaylor011@hotmail.com  for security reasons

DEAR:SIR/MADAM

I am Mr Joel Taylor I work with the office of the Director, Foreign 
Operation Department of Eco Bank NIG. PLC, Lagos Branch. It happened On the 
2nd of May 1999, Engr. S. BARNHILL, an AMERICAN  from New Orleans who used 
to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company In Nigeria (SPDC), Mr Engr. 
S. BARNHILL, his wife And their three children were involved in a car 
accident along Shagamu Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle 
unfortunately lost their lives. Since then, Eco Bank NIG. PLC have made 
several enquiries to  embassies to locate any of the extended relatives, 
this has also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives 
over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence 
I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money 
that belong to Mr Engr. S. BARNHILL, before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged. 
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about 
$18.6 Million Dollars has issued a notice to provide the next of kin or have 
the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.

Since bank have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3 years 
now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased, 
so that the proceeds of this account valued at $18.6 Million Dollars can be 
paid to you and then you and me can share the money,50% to me and 45% to 
you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may require, 
I have the Certificate of deposit that can be used to back up any claim we 
may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this 
deal through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by 
my email to enable us discuss further.
Thank you

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)
OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO.
 REPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL: isiaka_akida@yahoo.fr 
Dear Friend,
First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. However after series of petition was recieved by this present regime from foreign contractors and inability of the BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)to fulfill their obligation for the payment to its foreign creditors, in conjunction with the council of ministers, they mandated us to carry out a careful and comprehensive review of all overdue payments to foreign contractors and to effect payments immediately.
During the above mentioned process, we discovered an abandoned sum of US$10.M (Ten million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his
entire famil in a plane crash that happened in Kenya, East Africa.
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
Please I want you to visit the website below for more information about the Plane Crash:
www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html
It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account,and 50% would be for me, while 10% will be for expenses incure during the transaction. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated.
Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted.
Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of the application to fill and send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free risk and this transaction will only take us
14 banking days because as a banker, I know what to do and move the fund into your account without any delay and thatyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement have been made for the transfer.
You should contact me as soon as you receive this letter so that I will send you the text of the application to apply to the bank.
Yours faithfully.

To whom it may concern,

It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thank you for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when I was making some searches on the internet.
 
My name is Ahmed Abdul Kadir, a sudanese refugee; my Father was until recently, one of the personal aid to the former President of Iraq who was overthrown out of power during the War in Iraq which took many lives. I am contacting you to seek your co-operation in investing US$10.5 Million in your country or any other with good economic prospect.
 
My late father was able to safe guard the fund with the contacts he had in the Diplomatic Corps and the funds are being held under the protection and custody of a Diplomat friend of his. I have decided to contact you because I am interested in investing these funds. 
 
Please kindly guide and assist me in making the right investment as I am really a novice when considering the technicalities and logistics involved in running a business. The details of the investment will be worked out to our respective satisfaction.
 
In view of your participation, I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance, or better still commit it into a viable joint venture. Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the funds belong to me as the only surviving son and as soon as I get your consent, the necessary papers will be drawn up to facilitate the movement to the funds to your country for the investment.
 
However, upon your acceptance to work as my partner, you can contact me by return e-mail for more details. I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this and other business ventures will derive a huge success, please include you private contact telephone number and e-mail when replying.
 
Yours Sincerely.
Mr. Ahmed Abdul Kadir

My Dear:

First,I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this by virtue if 
its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOPSECRET.Though I know that a  
transaction of this magnitude will make  any one apprehensive and worried, 
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I am 
barrister Kofi Kosombo,solicitor at law.I am the personal attorney to Mr  
Paul Hamp , a national of your country,who was in contract with shell 
development company in Nigeria.On the 21st of April 1999,my client,his wife 
And their three Children were involved in  a caraccident along sagbama 
express road.

All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I 
have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients 
extended relatives  this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several 
unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the Internet, 
to locate any member of his family  hence I contacted you. I have contacted 
you to assist in retrieving the sum of US$10m deposited in a security 
company by my client before it get'sconfisicated because the security 
company doesn't know that the content of the consignment is cash because on 
the day of deposite we declared it as family valuables because we never want 
them to know the true content of the consignment.

The security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or 
have the consignment confisicated within the next two weeks and these very 
money is too  big for me to allow it to beconfisicated by the authority. 
Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2 
years now I seek your consent to  present you as the next of kin of the 
deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this 
consignment valued at 10million dollars can be released to you and then you 
and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary 
legal documents that can be used to back the claim.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. 
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. I am not imposing this 
transaction on you,It is a thing of self  willing ness,so it is either you 
write me back and tell me you are willing and I will know the next step to 
take because this fund must be claimed either with your help  or the help of 
somebody else. After going through the proposal and under standing it very 
well and you are willing to do this transaction with me,get back to me 
immediately so that we can start as follows:

1)I will send to you the contact of the security company,the deposite code, 
for you to call for verification if such deposite is really existing.
2)The claim will require both of our physical presentation at the security 
company. With constant communication it will not take us more than seven 
working days to achieve our aim.

It is a promise that at the end of the day you will embrace me and we will 
become one family friends for life as I was with my late client.  Your 
private telephone is also needed in reponse to this proposal for oral 
discussions and better understanding.
While I wait for your reply.

Best Regard
Koffi Kosombo.

It is with hope that I write to seek your help in this
context. Firstly,let me start by introducing myself
properly to you. My name is Thomas M.Ralph Taylor, the first
son of President Charles Taylor of Liberia. I got your
email address from network directory. I apologize if I
have infringed on your privacy.
You maybe aware, that my father President Charles
Taylor has been embattled by rebel forces in my
country, couple with his recent indictment by U.N
backed tribunal. These issues, have made world
headlines. Visit, www.liberianews.com
Now my father has accepted to quit power and leave
Liberia on the arrival of peacekeeping force which
might be headed by American troops. But the delay in
deploying peace keeping force, has worsen situation in
the country. In spite of this, My country Liberia, is
like a herd of cattle without shepherd. Rebels Groups
are still fighting to oust my father and assume office
as leaders. The rebel who see my family as a threat to
their ambitions, are planning to kill
every one of us when capture.
However, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am
not in any way interested in wars, this is why I
secretly left Liberia for Amsterdam to seek asylum.
Besides, I am using this correspondence to seek and
request your assistance and cooperation in a sensitive
but highly beneficial financial arrangement.
Prior to the Wars and embattlement of my father,
himself and I deposited a huge amount of money in a
security company?s vault overseas on my name. The
funds were arranged into a consignment before
deposited with the security company But, the security
company did not know that the consignment contains
money. Because, The consignment was declared to
contain family treasure and valuables.
The fact that the war persist and we continue to
accumulate huge debts daily as long as the consignment
remains in the security company?s vault, made me
decided to get someone reliable to proceed as soon as
possible to receive these funds
for investment purpose. As a young man, I plan to use
this money to safeguard my future.
It is very essential that you understand the kind of
trust and confidence I want to put in you. This is an
act of desperation on my part, in order not to loose
this money incase of any eventuality. For your
reliable assistance, if willing, I will reward you
with 25% of the money.
As soon as you declare your willingness to assist, i
shall furnish you with the details and information you
will need to accomplish this task. Please, be rest
assured that this arrangement is absolutely risk free
And cannot implicate you in any way. However, I
implore you to handle this matter with urgency, utmost
secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety
reasons, even if you do not intend to execute the
project.
Thank you in anticipation for your assistance in
enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me
whether or not you are interested in assisting me.
This will enable me scout for another perosn in the
event of non-interest on your part.

RE: TRANSFER OF US$48.223 MILLION {FORTY EIGHT MILLION  TWO HUNDRED & TWENTY 
THREE THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS  ONLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT}

Attn:

I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business having gone 
through your remarkable profile on the internet. Though, this medium 
(Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because 
it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this 
correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.

At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and 
trouble free to both parties.

My name is MR TONY HILL I work as the operational manager in account 
management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime 
banks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant 
domiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million 
two hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet 
investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago 
with his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the  
account and no other person knows about this account.

I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner 
and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy  
foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c 
is a foreigner and from Australia in particular. I am certainly sure that he 
has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no  beneficiary and 
nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner 
who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder  which I 
will provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need your cooperation 
in this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance 
to the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this 
dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.

I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to 
claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide 
your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement  that 
will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to 
nominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct  
phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in 
handling this transaction.

At the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total 
transfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any  
expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The 
fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer 
USD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you  after the 
successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will  
have the remaining balance of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account 
only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any 
disappointment from your side.

I am looking forward to have a reply from you through my E-mail or you can 
call me or fax me.If you want to call my No. dial the way you use to call 
other countries, do not put South African area code which is 27, because it 
is a satellite phone which I bourght for this transaction for the security 
reason because our local land line here is not secured.


Let me hear from you.
Best Regards,
MR.TONY HILL

It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective 
of the fact 
that you do not know me. However, I came to know of you in 
my private 
search for a reliable and trustworthy person that can 
handle a 
confidential transaction of this nature in respect of this, 
I got your 
contact through an uprooted search on the internet. Though 
I know that 
a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and 
worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the 
end of the 
day
I am Stevens Bangura, son of late Mr John Bangura of Sierra 
Leone who 
was killed by the Sierra Leone's rebel forces on the 24th 
of 
December,1999 in my country Sierra Leone.
When he was still alive, he deposited one trunk box 
containing the sum 
of USD$30 million dollars in cash (Ten Million dollars). 
with a private 
security and safe deposit company here in Abidjan Cote 
d´Ivoire. This 
money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my 
mother and she 
have already decided to use this money for future 
investment of the 
family.
Recently, I rushed down to Abidjan after being able to 
locate where my 
late father kept the depository Agreement made between 
himself and the 
security company. I have confirmed from the security 
company that the 
consignment is in their custody, when I demanded for the 
release of the 
consignment to me in my capacity of being the son of Mr 
Bangura, 
the depositor of the consignment, I was told that in the 
absence of my 
father, the only person that can demand for the release of 
the 
consignment is my late father´s foreign partner on whose 
behalf the 
consignment was deposited.
Meanwhile, my father have instructed me that in the case of 
his death, 
that I should look for a trusted foreigner who can assist 
me to move 
out this money from Côte d´Ivoire immediately for 
investment .

Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to transfer 
this fund 
into your Account, but I will demand for the following 
requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country after 
retrieving the 
box containing the money from the custody of the security 
company.

(2) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable 
business venture 
that would not require much technical expertise in your 
country where 
part of this fund will be invested?

I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this 
transaction based on the trust I have established on you.
For your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to 
compensate 
you with 10 percent of the total amount at the end of this 
business. 
The security of this business is very important to me and 
as such, I 
would like you to keep this business very confidential.
I shall expect an early response from you.
Thank you and God bless.

Dear friend




My proposal to you will be very surprising as we have not had any
personal contact. However I sincerely seek your confidence in this
transaction which I propose to you as a person of transparency and caliber

Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you My name
is Carlos Savimbi cousin and Personal Assistant of Jonas Malheiro
Savimbi the leader UNITA (National Union for the Total independence
of Angola) I got your email address from network directory I apologize
if I infringed  on your privacy.

You may know that my Uncle was recently killed in a battle with
the government troops of Angola led by President Dos Santos on friday 22nd
February 2002

Now Mr Antonio Dembo who was my Uncle's second in command has
assumed office as leader of UNITA In spite of this UNITA is like
a herd of cattle without shepherd Prominent members like Carlos
Morgado are still lobbying to oust him and assume office as leader
to enrich themselves and some of them who see me as a threat to
their ambitions including Mr Dembo are planning to kill me For
more information check www.angola.org

However I am a young man who has ambitions and I am not in any
way interested in wars this is why I secretly left Angola

I am sincerely seeking for your urgent help in respect to safekeeping
of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales This
money US$20 million was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss
Bank account It was on transit with a safe deposit company
in Europe when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred.

As a matter of fact this is the reason I chose to come and
seek political asylum. It is very clear with the way things are
now that President Dos Santos will lobby the International Community

to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad to ground UNITA
since he has already done this in Angola.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future It is very essential
that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want
to put in you is extraordinary and an act of desperation on my
part in order not to lose this money Please treat this contact
with utmost secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety reasons.

The help I need from you is clearing the box containing the money
from the security company after which it will be deposited in
an account in your name . The money
shall remain in your custody till my asylum application is granted
and I have the permit to conduct business then you will transfer
the account to me Meanwhile the money can be invested into risk-free
profitable ventures and there will an agreement to protect my interest.
I have all the documents that will enable you claim the consignment from
the security company.
To make this deal relisable i need a committment from you that it will be
kept confidential,your tel nd fax numbers including mobile for easy
communications,your permanent address as well as some form of
identification.
For your reliable assistance I will reward you with 20% of the money
and we shall use 5% to carry out every expenses that we incurr during the
transaction
and the investment process. 75%shall be for my family.

I thank you in advance in anticipation for your assistance in enabling
me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested
in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in
the event of non-interest on your part.
Please reply to savimbicar1@fizgigs.com

Sincerely,

CARLOS SAVIMBI.

ADAMS IBRAHIM <adams000014@hotmail.fr>,,"Mon, 02 Oct 2006 12:30:53 +0200",MESSAGE FROM MR. ADAMS IBRAHIM.TREAT AS URGENT,"Dear Friend,

I feel quite safe dealing with you in this business proposition though, this
medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it 
because it still remains the fastest, surest and most secured medium of 
communication.

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met 
before.My name is Mr ADAMS IBRAHIM  I am the bill and exchange manager in 
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK [A.D.B) I Hoped that you will not expose or betray 
this trust and  confident that i am about to repose on you for the mutual 
benefit of our both families.

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along 
with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole 
passengers on  6th of augustus 1997 and for your perusal you can view this 
site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen 
interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has 
come to claim his funds of US$8.3M (Eight Million Three Hundred Thoudsand 
United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very long
time.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next 
of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again.The Banking ethics here 
does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because the money 
will be recalled to the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund after this
period.

In view of this I got your contact through the internet when i was making a 
research on a foreignerthat I will use in this great  opportunity because i 
dont want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as uncliamed fund.I 
have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will be for 
me.

The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased 
man was a foreigner and  it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank 
for a citizen of BURKINA FASO to make the claim of the fund.So the request 
of you as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the claim and transfer of 
the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the Next Of Kin to the 
deceased.

If you are really sure of your integerity, trustworthy and confidentiality, 
and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with 
your telephone and fax numbers and banking account details where you wish to 
receive the fund.

Upon receipt of the above mentioned informations,indicating your interest in 
the business,I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application which 
you will type  and send back to our bank to enable us start this 
transaction.

I will  not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free on 
both sides and dont have any negative impact.You should not entertain any 
fear as all modalities for  the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has 
been finalized, this  transaction will be completed within 10 bank working
day immediately you applied to the Bank as relation to the deceased
customer.

Waiting for your urgent response

           Yours sincerely,

          Mr ADAMS IBRAHIM

Valiant Privatbank AG
Postfach, 3001 Bern
Switzerland 
                                                
IMPERATIVE AND PRIVATE. 

I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money from a 
deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude 
will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that 
all will be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact you due 
to the urgency of this transaction.  

PROPOSITION; 

We discovered an abandoned sum of US$20,500,000.00 (Twenty Million Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. 
Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward 
to lay claims for this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund 
from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to 
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this 
discovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of 
kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out 
by us for the funds (US$20,500,000.00) to be released in your favour as 
the beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you to know that we have 
secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of deceased 
beneficiaries.  

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual 
business endeavour by furnishing me with the following; 

1. Your name and address 
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers 

These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the 
appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before 
the transfer can be made. We shall be compensating you with 30% on 
final conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be for us. 

If this proposal is acceptable by you, please response immediately. I 
await your urgent response. 

Regards, 

Mr. Markus Bopp

My name is Mr.Bernard Martin and I work in the International  Operation Department in a Bank here in London. I feel quite safe  dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium  (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it  because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However,  this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated  as such.  At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is  100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT  MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN  ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader. Until his death,The Late Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge  investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a  matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND  FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London  which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about  this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant  domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED  AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet  investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed  away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will  approve this money to any foreigne r because the former operator of the  a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for  the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with  legal claims to the account Holder,  Therefore I need your cooperation  in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in  order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down  now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 -  February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self- made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister  of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from  office on October 20, 2004.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I Believe Everyone will die someday. My name is JAIN HAGIS I am a merchant of Oman Nationality but presently residing in London. I have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and Right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for Anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have 
distributed money to some charity organizations in the Oman, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my 
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. 

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be
contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen million united state dollars $18,000,000 that I have with finance/Security Company in europe. 

I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.

God be with you.

mr. JAIN HAGIS

I will not want you to send me an email on this box. I will want you to send me an email on this box {jahagis3@myway.com}. This is because my brother saw me when I was sending this email to you and I will not want them to know that I am in contact with you.

consultancy directory during my search for a reliable and honest person to
transact this business
with.
  I write to solicit for your special assistance to a family shattered by a
tyrannical government led by a dictator and his(ZANU-PF)ruling
party-president
Robert Mugabe.Because of land and farm land crisis in Zimbabwe,the government
secretly sponsored the war veterans and some irrate party members to
disposess the
land being occupied by white farmers.This action has led to the killing of
some
members of opposition party including my husband(Mr.PETER DUBE).
  But before the death of my husband,he anticipated some dangers and so he
deposited
the sum of US$15.4m(Fifteen million four hundered Thousand United States
Dollars)in the name of our only son JAMES DUBE,with the help of reputable
security
company in south Africa with the intention of using it to open fertilizer
manufacturing company among other companies in our neighbouring
country(Swaziland)after his university education.
  On the 29th of June 2000,the war veterans and some supporters
of(ZANU-PF)ruling
party trooped into our compound and axed him(my husband)to death.Since
then,they
have been terrorizing my only son,JAMES DUBE,but we managed to escape to a
neighbouring country,South Africa as a political asylum
seeker(refugee).But our
position in South Africa does not permit us to open an account or run any
huge
financial business.
  That is why I want this fund to be transferred into your private account
so that
you will assist him to invest it in your country.Hence,if you agree to assist
us,we will offer you 20% of the money for your assistance,80% will be for our
family investment in your country through your assistance.I need your

smithkam2@post.com,R@M,"Sat, 23 Nov 2002 15:01:14 +0100",MICHAEL!," From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

MY RELEASE FROM PRISON WAS NECESSITATED BY THE EFFORTS OF THE FORMMER SENATE PRESIDENT, CHIEF ANYIM PIUS ANYIM AND THE SPEAKER OF THE LOWER HOUSE, ALHAJI GHALI NA'ABBA. 
SINCE MY FATHER'S DEATH AND MY DETENTION FOR CLOSE TO THREE YEARS, MY FAMILY HAS BEEN LOOSING A LOT OF MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH OUR FAMILY. AFTER MY RELEASE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA HAS MADE ME SIGN SOME DOCUMENTS THAT WILL ENABLE THEM EXTRACT THE SUM OF ONE BILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION US DOLLARS FROM MY FATHER'S BANK ACCOUNTS IN LONDON,SWITZERLAND,LUXEMBIURG,LIECHTENSTEIN AND JESEY ETC.

FROM MR CHARLES ZUMA

DIRECTOR OF FINANCE

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT,

BANK OF AFRICA,

COTONOU-BENIN REPBLIC.

E-MAIL BOX:barrcharleszuma1@yahoo.ca



My name is Mr.JAMES BROWN. I am the credit AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING

UNIT,BANK OF AFRICA,COTONOU-BENIN REPBLIC. I am contacting you of a business


transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know

that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and

worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off,

and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you

due to the urgency of this transaction.

PROPOSITION; I am the account officer  of a foreigner named Gerald Welsh

who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999

in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can

confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD

NEWS.


WEBSITE. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm Since his

death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money

as his heir, because they all died in the same accident himself and his

wife(May their soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his

account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the

deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.


Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a

next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully

worked out by me for the funds (USD 10,700,000.00) to be released in

your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after four years the

money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and

the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. 


so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to

share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.

It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an

order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please

acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual

business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are

interested.


1.A Beneficiary name. In order for me to prepare the document for

transfer of the funds in your name. 2. Direct Telephone and fax

numbers. For  our personal contact and mutual trust in each other.

I shall be compensating you with [3million Million Dollars)

on final conclusion of this project for your assistance, while the

balance of 5 Million Dollars shall be for me for investment purposes.

Because I intend to retire after the conclusion of this transaction.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me

immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed

in you, I await your urgent reply. to this address: barrcharleszuma1@yahoo.ca

CHARLES ZUMA

address:rimomoh1@hknetmail.com).

Compliments of the season. I would like to firstly send to 
you the best wishes of good health and success in your 
pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in 
this letter. Before going into details of my proposal to 
you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost 
confidentiality, as this is required for its success. 
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal 
Government of Nigeria,s Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who 
are interested in diverting some funds that are presently 
floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. 
In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your 
assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated 
account the said floating funds. We are determined to 
conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 
2003. The source of the funds is as follows: During the 
last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set 
up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were 
grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and 
parastatals. The present civilian government set up the 
contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the 
instruments of payments made available to it by the decree 
setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if 
necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. 
My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of 
these funds which are presently floating in the Central 
Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to 
divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue 
of our positions as civil servants and members of this 
panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the 
names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have 
therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my 
colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas 
partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of 
U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred 
thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this 
letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into 
your account, if you agree with our proposition as 
follows; (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for 
us (the panel officials (iii)10% to be used in settling 
all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the 
actualization of this project.
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project 
in foreign stock markets and other business till we are 
ready and able to have access to them without raising any 
eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 
100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking 
days from the date of receipt of the following information 
through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, 
Companys name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the 
account number into which the funds should be paid. The 
above information will enable us write letters of claim and 
job description respectively. This way, we will use your 
companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the 
award of the contract to your company. We are looking 
forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit 
for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my 
direct Telephone number 234 8033064962 and my America 
Internet Fax number 1 92896 27169

It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will 
bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction 
when I hear from you.

Ms Nasrinn N.Farooq <sedattz01@yahoo.es>,R@M,"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 13:45:28 +0400",FROM: Ms Nasrinn N.Farooq,"My Dear Friend,
I got your contact through a desperate and personal search on the web for someone I could really trust as I have prayed over it and I wish to express my interest to handle this matter with you as Ibelieve that you are reliable in handling these type of international transaction.

Though we have not met before but I believe one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life but however is not mandatory or in any manner compel you to Honor against your will.

Although I am not suppose to contact you through email but it is because of the confidential nature of this transaction please bear with me

I am Ms Nasrinn N.Farooq, a top bank official in the National Bank of Dubai,(UNITED ARAB EMIRATES).

I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.

On June 6, 1999,an Oil consultant/contractor with Dubai Petroleum Corporation, MR DAVID AMEERALY, made a numbered time(fixed)deposit for twelve calendar months,Valued at US$16,500, 000.00 (sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Dubai Petroleum Corporation that MR DAVID AMEERALY, died in the plane crash On October 31,1999,(an Egyptian Boeing767Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml

On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless .I therefore made further investigation and discovered that MR DAVID AMEERALY,did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank.

This sum of US$16,500, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to UNITED ARAB EMIRATES LAW,at the expiration of(Ten) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

My proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to MR DAVID AMEERALY, so that the fruit of this old man labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for preparing the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.

Any bank account in any part of the world,which you will provide,will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.

The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of  45% for me and 45% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses in cured during the business.There is no risk at all.

The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of  this transaction.

If you are interested,please reply immediately and upon your responses,I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Please upon the receipt of this mail message,send to me the following below to enable me start the processing of the transfer,

1.Your Full Name
2.Your House Address.
3.Your Phone Number and Fax,

Thank You And God Bless You.

Sincerely,

Ms Nasrinn N.Farooq  ",1,1
Reverend Ngoly <ngo@mail32.com>,R@M,"Thu, 29 Apr 2004 09:09:45 +0000",From Reverend Ngoly,"Dear Friend,

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This
 is by the virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure 
and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute 
a transaction of this great magnitude.

We want to transfer (US$150,000,000.00) One hundred and fifty million 
United States Dollars from an investment bank in Port Au-Prince, 
Haiti to a reliable overseas account.I solicit your assistance to enable us
transfer the said amount into your safe account for onward investment.
You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new 
bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to
me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing
that you will never let us down either now or in the future.

My name is Rev.Ngo Ngoly. I am the Head of International Operations of a prime commercial bank
here in Bangui, Central African Republic. I have been mandated by a 
senior Aide of the exiled Leader of Republic of Haiti, Jean Bertrand
Aristide who have just been abducted and forced to exile in Bangui, 
CAR together with his families and aides by the American and French
government, to solicit for a reliable individual or company whom we 
can present as a front to effect the transfer of this funds out of Haiti. 

The owner has secured this amount with a fictitious name at a bank
in Haiti. This Aide has equally assured me that with the assistance 
of their colleagues who are still holding most key post in the financial
power bases of their country, it is not a problem to have the funds
transferred out of the investment bank in Haiti to any other part of
the world except my county, CAR. It is not a good idea to transfer 
this amount to my country directly from Haiti due to the fact that my 
country is one of the poorest nations in the whole world. 

Secondly, the whole world is aware that Mr.Aristide has just arrived in
this country some few days ago to live in exile, it must definitely raise
a big dust when the money arrives here. With my position and 
influence in the bank over here, the money can be transferred to 
any foreign reliable account that you can provide within 10 days 
with assurance that this money will be left untouched until our 
physical arrival in your country for sharing. I have secretly discussed 
this business with my colleague who also holds a strategic portfolio in 
my bank and he has willingly agreed to join the train. 

The 20% of this amount will be for you while the remaining balance will
be for all of us here. Please reply immediately if you are interested in this business but if you wish not to participate in the deal for any
reason that will only be known to you and kindly keep all this details strictly
to your self. I will provide you with the full details and our mode of the
operations once I receive your positive response in these regards.

Best regards, 

Rev.Ngo Ngoly

I was privileged to come across your contact through my personal check on your country�s 

business and investment portal and I decided that I should establish a communication with 

you to acquiring some information on lucrative investment or establishment in your country.
 
Be it as it may, I will appreciate if you can be of good assistance to me as I am willing to 

invest my money  in your country provided I will have a good partner or investor as well 

fund manager who will guide on this business framework and as thus, share with me the 

dividend in any venture which we have considered lucrative to invest in and I have not 

managed any business before but have always dreamt of running my own establishment hence my 

desire to invest in your country in blue chip ventures, production or real estate.
 
Further to this, I will like to give you a little more information about me, I am an 

American but married into the Sharjah Royal Family here in Sharjah United Arab Emirate, but 

at the moment undergoing a divorce suit with my husband through the sharia court and 

hopefully will get this matter over within a couple of weeks and that is why I want to calve 

a niche for myself to be able to continue with my life and make my life meaningful when I 

leave my husband�s family. The funds I intend to invest with you are currently in a UAE bank 

here as was deposited by my late father who worked before he died as a chemical engineer in 

the Saudi Oil Corporation ARAMCO and later the Emirate National Oil Corporation ENOC.
 
My reason of trying to establish my own business is necessitated by the advent of my divorce 

suit with my husband and according to the sharjah marital law here, if my husband family 

gets any knowledge of the funds in the bank, they will take possession of the funds since my 

father used my name as the next of kin.
 
It is my wish to handle this matter privately under the most cautious legal arrangement to 

get the funds into your possession before we can commence any trade deal and therefore 

demand that you kindly give me a brief information about you with pictures, contact address 

and telephone numbers incase I want to call you .
the money in question (US$9,750,000) was deposited into the bank about two years back before 

my father died of heart failure and ever since his death, my relationship with my husband 

has gone bad hence my decision to file for the divorce amongst other reasons which I shall 

let you know
A friend of mine advised that what we shall do is to portray you as an investor who has 

given that money to my father before he died for a crude oil lifting from the Saudi oil 

corporation but the deal was thwarted due to the sudden death of my father.
By this strategy, hire the services of a lawyer here who will secure a letter of 

administration notarized by the high court with a sworn affidavit of change of ownership and 

application to the bank for the release of the funds to you under the emirate inheritance 

law. This logistics is to get the funds transferred to you as the bonafide owner of the 

funds to avoid any implications that will not permit me as being married to the royal family 

to possess such chattel or estate of my late father in conformity with the sharia marital 

law.
So I hope you understand very well, the strategies and where you don�t quite comprehend, do 

ask me for more clarifications and for your involvement I will pay you 15% of the total 

money for your consultancy and then we can invest the rest still under your supervision. Pls 

reply this mail at info_pat@z6.com

Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa <fatima_khalifa2004@Z6.com>,,"Tue, 18 May 2004 08:14:07 -0700",Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa,"FROM: MRS, FATIMA RASHEED KHALIFA
ADDRESS:NORTH ZONE BAZRA IRAQ.)
 
 
Please permit me your little endulgence to solicit
for your unreserved attention,
based on my urgly condition of life though one with
almighty Allah is with majority.
I am Mrs Fatima R. Khalifa, a widow to Late Sheik
Mohammed Rasheed Khalifa.

I am 64 years old of a born muslim faith. Presently
i am suffering from long time cancer of the breast, from 
all indications, my condition is really deteriorating
and is quite obvious that I won't live more than six
months according to my doctor,because the cancer stage has 
gotten to a very bad stage.
 
My late husband was killed during the invasion of
collition forces from American and Britain in Iraq,
unfortunately he died leaving behind a huge sum of money
which he had looted from a supply of ammunition to
the ex- Saddam Hussein Government.
This money is now in the vault of a private security
company oversea to be precise in Holland,
but due to my present bad condition of health as I
am suffering from Cancer of the breast its quite
impossible for me to travel that distance to receive
this money.
 
To this effect I have writen a letter throgh my
family lawyer requesting for the transfer
of this box to Dubai United Arab Emirates pending
when I can succeed in getting a trust and
reliable person to utilize this money. Although,
today, I have received a signal from the security
company notifying me of the approval to transfer  the
consignment through their agent.

Therefore, let me receive your total support and
security assurance that the consignment will
be save in your hand .
 
I want you to understand that a neither have any son
nor have any person to entrust this
money to which I know that it is better make use of
a total foreigner to achieve my aim.
Atleast had it been that during the period of our
marriage we could produce any child, my late
husband was very wealthy and after his death, his
offspring will inherited all his business and wealth.
 
I got your contact through a desperate and personal
search on the web, for someone
I could really trust and I have prayed over it.
 
Therefore my desire now is to contribute part of
this  wealth to the propagation of islam and in
assisting the less-privileged Muslim faithful in
Africa,Asia,Europe and in all Arab-Nation's .
 
I have discussed this with my Family Lawyer hence I
am willing to donate part of it atleast 40% of  the
total sum of US$16,250,00000. (sixteen Million two hundred
and fifty thousand US Dollars)for the development of
the holy work of islam, as well as distribution's to aid
muslim's faithfuls.

Please I want you to note that, this fund is lying
in a Security Company in Holland The Netherlands so it can be 
transferred to you upon your readiness to co-join with me in this 
transaction and secure the money.


For that, my lawyer will file application's that
will back you up for the transfer of
the money in your name as the beneficiary only if
you promise to use this funds/my donations
judiciouly for the said purpose.
 
Therefore,I have decided to set-aside 40% for the
promotion of holy islam and the work of Allah.
while 30% will be retuned back to me through my
lawyer so that I can offset my bills
in the hospital because of the cancer treatment.
 
If you have to die says the Allah, keep fit and I
will give you the crown of life.
May the Grace of Allah be our guide and be my refuge
when i leave this world.
 
Moreso,I further decided to offer you 20% While the
remaining 10% is for the expenses incured during
the facillitation of the project.

Yours in Allah,

Mrs Fatima Rasheed Khalifa

Vincent Cheung <gladvince01@yahoo.co.uk>,R@M,"Thu, 06 Sep 2007 15:41:26 -0400",HELLO ,"Vincent Cheung
Foreign Operations department
Hang Seng Bank
11/F Hang Seng Wanchai Building,
200 Hennessy Road, Wanchai


Hello,
 
I am Mr Vincent Cheung, of the Hang Seng Bank 
11/F Hang Seng Wanchai Building, 200 Hennessy Road, Wanchai .
An Iragi named Fadi Basem,a business man made a numbered fixed deposit 
of (346,736,899.68 HKD) for 18 calendar months, this is valued to 
Fourty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in 
my 
branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the 
war, four years ago (2003). Again after the war another notification 
was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that 
Fadi Basem and his family had been killed during the war in Gunfire 
that hit their home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was.
 
After further investigation it was also discovered that Fadi Basem
did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the 
paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last 
time 
he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my 
bank. So, Fourty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State 
Dollars is 
still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. 
What bothers me is that according to the laws of my country at the 
expiration five years six months the funds will revert to the ownership
 
of 
the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
 
My proposal, We are prepared to place you as the next of kin in a 
position to instruct HANG SENG BANK to release the deposit to you as 
the 
closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, we am prepared
 
to 
share the money with you on to be agreed on percentages. That is: I
 will simply nominate you 
as 
the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. I would have
 gone ahead to ask the funds be released
 to me, but that would have drawn a straight line in my involvement in 
claiming the deposit.I assure you that I could have the deposit 
released 
to you within the coming weeks. I will simply inform the bank of the
 final 
closing of the file relating to the late customer, I will then 
officially 
communicate with my Bank and instruct them to release the deposit to 
you. 
With these: all is done. I am aware of the consequences of this 
proposal.
 
I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should 
discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive.
 
If 
my offer is of no appeal to you,delete this message and forget I ever 
contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of 
my 
proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made 
tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking 
sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good 
conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of
 
my 
industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come 
ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for 
once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont 
pass 
me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work 
with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy 
me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with 
new 
opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well
 
worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have 
here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am 
the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you 
with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my 
life. 
Lets
share the blessing.
 
If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a
 
conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via 
official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I 
repeat, I 
do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I 
want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me 
only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through the 
email account that i will provide therein in this email.
 
Further more be informed that the fact that you are a foreigner gives 
you the privilege to stand in as my deceased client beneficiary as my 
deceased client had no relation all his family died with him during the
 
war and I can not use my relations because its not accepted here in 
Hong Kong. Also I am very confident that we will be able to establish 
the 
trust that is needed to complete this deal and all that I need from the
 
time been is your willingness and commitment so that we can end this in
 
the next two weeks.
 
What you need to understand about this transaction is that I will make 
sure that it passes through all international banking laws regards to 
this I will give the transaction the proper documentation 
that is required to perfect the finishing. Your only obligation in this
 
transaction will be to set up the offshore accounts that can 
accommodate these funds and I will give you more light later once you 
agree to 
partner with me.
 
Like I said before there is no risk involve as it will pass through 
international banking laws and all documents related to this 
transaction 
will be sent to you by post for your perusal and trust.

Denguele Samatigui <denguele_samatigu10@hotmail.com>,,"Fri, 13 Oct 2006 13:56:14 +0000","Mr Denguele Samatigui, TREAT VERY URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL.","Dear Friend,

I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics, 
which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life, But please 
treat with absolute secrecy and personal. I pray that this email reaches you 
in the best of health.

I am Mr Denguele Samatigui, the manager of bill and  exchange at the foreign 
remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my  department we discoveredan  
abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred thousand US 
dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died 
along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next 
of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  
indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at 
the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this 
business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or 
relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank 
treasury as   unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained 
unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank  
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by
the fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you 
as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for 
expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.

Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  
fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or  
next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  
number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective
communication and location where the money will be  transfer.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this 
transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should 
contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail,

Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully.

HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONG KONG.

Dear Sir,

   Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office 
that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.
 So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like youas a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.
 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. 
 There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt alegalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bankaccount we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for anyexpenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Mr. Wang  Qin

     PLEASE REPLY TO  k_omidire@yahoo.com

Good day and a happy and prosperous new year !

I am Kolapo Omidire, company secretary and manager,
internal and external services of COMMERCIAL BANK OF
AFRICA. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my
bank who perished with his entire family 
(His wife and only son) in a plane crash (Korean Air Line
801) on August 6, 1997.

Since the demise of this customer of ours , the bank
management of COMMERCIAL BANK OF AFRICA has made valuable
efforts to get in touch with any of the late customer's
Next-of-Kin or relative anywhere in the world but 
unfortunately, all our efforts did not yield any positive
results as no one has come to claim his funds to the tune
of Twenty one million, five hundred thousand united states
dollars(USD21.5m) which has been with my bank all these
while.

Recently, the Federal Government of Nigeria directed that
all funds not claimed (which has exceeded the stipulated
banking period of seven years for such money) should be
confiscated to the Federal Government Treasury Because
the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay
more than seven years.This means that this money will be
recalled to the federal Government treasury as unclaimed
after this period, precisely within this first quater 
of this year.

On this note, the chairman of the board of directors of the
bank recently called me and told me in confidence and trust
to source for a reliable foreigner who would stand as our
foreign customer's next of kin. We (myself
and the chairman) have reasoned that if we fail to collect
this money the Nigerian government will confisticate it and
someone else will end up looting it. Thats's why we have
decided to contact you, hoping you will prove to
be a reliable foreigner to stand as next of Kin to the
deceased customer to claim the total fund from his account
with the bank so that the proceeds of his account can be
paid to you.

Be assured that this transaction is risk free and we will
do all possible to give it the legal and legitimate backing
it requirs so that both parties will be protected from
breach of the law both locally and internationally.

Upon receipt of your response, I shall furnish you with the
next step to take on how you shall prosecute this claim to
your account. The entire transaction should be completed
within 10 official working days from
the day the bank receives your initial application.

When you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mail
signifying Your acceptance or otherwise, include your
private Telephone numbers for more explanation
and confidential communication.

Waiting to hear from you soon,
Best Regards,
K. Omidire.   PLEASE REPLY TO  k_omidire@yahoo.com

DR (MRS) MARIAM ABACHA <koolizzy@hotmail.com>,R@M,"Fri, 06 Jun 2003 21:20:44 -0700",URGENT HELP NEEDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My Dear,
It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and 
assistance in the context stated
below:May I first introduce my self: I am DR.(MRS.) MARIAM
ABACHA,the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former
Military head of state and President of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June
1998. I got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works 
with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism,due,I did not disclose 
to her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my 
life and my children. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by 
the sponsor of the recommendation, I became convinced of your capability 
and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly 
willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).
This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have 
all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for 
safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to 
avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on 
how to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a 
conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for 
non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian 
administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the 
Federal Republic of Nigeria) is
seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail 
sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of 
this vendetta,the present Government have resolved to freeze all known 
assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and 
are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband 
in Switzerland,UK and Australia. In fact, the attack on our family (The 
Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling 
passport,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in 
court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband..My first son
Mohammed Abacha who was arrested and incacerated for the past 3years was
just reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the
Federal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We are
not ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accounts
abroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime.
In view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival,our 
family trustee have secretly protected the will,The Security Company has 
called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the 
demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very
soon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas 
amount, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come 
to my full assistance and unlimited
co-operation.In the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole 
family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living 
on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the 
sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be 
trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me 
and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will 
compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of 
the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.
In that case, when the money ($20 Million) is moved into your
discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in
your favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incure 
(There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by 
you.)during the process of securing this fund.
The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future. 
My cousin (KADIRI MOHAMMED) has perfected arrangements with the Trust 
Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe 
operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance 
Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide 
owner.
And in due course, all contacts must be made through
DR.KADIRI MOHAMMED through his Telephone: 234-8033333606
E-mail address: kadiri_hammed@zwallet.com or kadiri_hammed2@zwallet.com
I look forward to your quick response while thanking
you for your co-operation. In view of all above
details, I request you to keep this letter and
co-operation highly confidential.
Best wishes,
DR.(MRS). MARIAM ABACHA.
ABACHAS LODGE,KANO.

Greetings,
  I am making this contact to you 
on the fact that we may be of assistance to each other in developing a 
long lasting cordial business relationship, if you put your trust in  
God that this will work out forthe benefit of my own family and 
yours.  

  I was moved by my personal inspiration to entrust on your 
sincerity to  handle a business relationship that involves huge money 
on trust. I was  constrained by the sudden death of my husband, the 
former Minister of  Power andsteel and currently before his death, the 
Minister for Justice  of my country, whom was assassinated by an 
unknown men.
 I am Mrs. grace Bola Ige, the second wife of the late Mr. 
Bola Ige who died on  December 23rd 2001. With heart full of grief, I 
regret to inform you of  the inhumane and harsh conditions which my 
husband's first wife and the brother's have subjected my two daughters 
and me. Since my husband's death,the relatives have been wicked to us 
because of the following reasons:

1. I am not from the same tribe with 
them,

2. My refusal to  learn and speak their tribal language and 
dress like other women from their tribe,
3. My refusal to accept their 
religion,

4. Because I have  no male child,

5. Because I was 
specially loved and favored I am  absolutely tired of all these threats 
from my husband relatives since the death of my husband.

I am no 
longer in their Family house. am now  in my husband's guesthouse, with 
my daughters, I seriously need your kind assistance and co-operations.
Few weeks before my husband's death, he entrusted some security 
documents that cover a deposit he made to a security company to the 
tune of 25 million U.S dollars to my care for  safe keeping in my 
apartment in Abuja.

 After his death I acted fast  and required to 
gather information about the consignment. I was made to know that it 
was deposited as family treasure of a foreigner/associate  to be 
delivered on request. This fund was deposited for safe keeping with a 
Private Security Company.

 Now I am seeking for a reliable foreigner 
who can come down to clear the funds in his/her name as the  sole 
beneficiary of the Consignment. This is so because of my status here as 
a widow of a political juggernaut. Now I solicit your assistance to 
accept this sum for self-keeping. This I cannot lodge into a bank 
account here in my name to avoid suspicion from the Government, my 
husband's brother's and wife since they have Confiscated all that is 
left by my husband and still places eyes on me if they could lay hands 
on more including cash as they have left me and my  children without 
any cash.
If you can accept this, I urge you to  contact us immediately 
for us to brief you on arrangement on how we can  possibly handle this.

This is why I honestly contacted you because investing this money 
abroad should be the best for my dauthers and me. I will be honored if 
I can be given the privilege of dealing with the investment proceeding 
with you.

I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to 
this distress call to save US from a hopeless future. And if you agree, 
I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this 
regard with 30% of the principal sum. While the remaining 70% will be 
invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of 
business and different sectors of the Economy in your  country which 
are dividends yielding. Whatever your decision is please  reach me 
immediately through my email.And keep this letter tight secret  for the 
interest of my Family.

I regret to inform you of the inhumane  and 
harsh conditions which my husband's first wife Justice Mrs. Atinuke Ige 
and the brother's have subjected me and my two daughters. Since my  
husband death, the relatives have been wicked to us in my husband 
family.

I hope to hear from you soon.

This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met,but it should not ,since we are determine to get what rightly belongs to us anyhow,but soon when every thing goes according to plan.The message could be strange but reality will definitely dawn on you,if you pay some attention to it's content.I would'nt have notified you but for the sake of your integrity and goodwill.Please accept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message to you.I have to say that i have no intentions of causing you any personal pains or discomfort.
I am MR Joseph Savimbi,Son of the late rebel leader Jonas Savimbi of Angola who was killed on the 22nd of February 2002.We are desperately looking for a trustworthy person to assist us in this Confidential bUSINESS.My late father,Jonas Savimbi deposited Huge Sums of Money realised from the sale of Diamonds and Precious stones/Metals in different Bank in Europe.My father is presently no more,and the movement of his family members(including me the son)is highly restricted.We are forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our immediate localities.Presently,the money realized from those sales amounting to US$25,000000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS),which my father realized,and was tranfered to Netherlands.Is safe in a security Firm,over there.Before you can get access to it you have to be given the password and the Personal identification numbers(PIN NO:)of the consignment deposited.I am therefore soliciting your help to have t!
 his money collected by you and transfered into your account,as I and my family would give you the neccesary documentions,to facilitate your collection of the consignment personally in Amsterdam,before the government gets wind of this arrangement.You know my father was a rebel leader in his life time before his death.
My reason for doing this,is because it will be difficult for the present Angolan Government to trace my father's money to an individual's account,especially when such an individual bears no blood relationship with us.I have decided to keep that Money for my family's use.Presently the money is still in that security Company in Netherlands.
I am currently and temporarily living in Luanda with my family seeking for my refugee status.moreover the political climate in Angola at the moment is very tense,sentitive and unstable.With this password and informations that we will give you,together with the Power of Attorney,you will then proceed to the security firm,and these will facilitate your collection of the consignment.You have to proceed personally to Netherlands where after fulfiling their requirements,the us$25,000,000.00 will be released to you in the two lage trunk boxes that it was deposited in,after which we may likely ask you to come over with some money for us to run away from here at least for now into one of these European countries.You can have the Fund tranfered into any account hat suits you,after your personal collection of the consignment,until further instructions are given to you by my family.
***PLEASE YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS HIGHLY REQUIRED.
Thank you very much for your time and understanding.
Yours Sincerely,

Attention Pls., 
IN DESPERATE NEED OF YOUR CO-OPERATION! 
I write you this letter from Detention to solicit your help, as I am in dire need of your co-operation in this urgent matter. 
I am Steve Moore, a Colonel in The Coalition Army(country detail will be given after introduction and proper establishment 
of trust) deployed to Iraq in the wake of the change of the Sadam Hussein Regime in Iraq. I served there until I was 
arrested and detained in connection with the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal in 2004. I was previously attached to a Military 
Base in Osnabrueck,Germany before my deployment to Iraq. I am presently at a detention facility in Osnabrueck,Germany. 
In the course of my stay in Iraq,I have withnessed so much looting from which many colleagues have benefited in excess 
of some millions of Dollars. After a long hesitation, I decided to grab the opportunity that God had given me by placeing me 
in charge of the Security of all the recovered money. 
This is a part of the money that the regime of Sadam Hussein,their friends and cronies had stolen and hidden in various parts 
of Iraq before the war.It became the responsibility of the Allied soldiers to search for,recover this money and plough it back 
into the governance of Iraq. In the proccess of securing the money running into hundreds of millions of US Dollars,we were 
able to keep some away for ourselves. Thats how the money came about. 
Everything went well until I was accused in 2004 alongside other colleagues suspected to have abused inmates of prisons 
under the control of Allied Forces in Iraq. 
I initially thought that my stay in prison awaiting trial would be brief but I have spent some time here without any change in 
my hopeless situation! Now that I dont know how long I would stay here,and faced with the possibility of dismissal from the 
Army if I am found guilty,I have come to accept that it is only proper to try and make some kind of reliable contact who could 
help me pick up and safe-keep this money so that I dont lose everything I have saved during my stay in Iraq.Who knows;such 
an opportunity,they say, comes once in a lifetime! 
I just need a guarantee of trust from you because there have been cases of breach of trust in the past by contacts that some 
of my colleagues have fronted for such transactions.I have presently,the sum of US$41.7m already shipped to safety somewhere 
in Europe. I only need you to guarantie me that I can still get this money back,if it is remitted to you. I need a person I can trust 
to safeguard this money since it is not possible to leave here and do it myself. All the arragerment to guarantee you a safe 
access to the money has been made by me before my arrest.Your only part is to receive and safeguard it. We would further 
discuss on how the money should be disbursed afterwards. 
For your role in this business,I wish to compensate you handsomely on successful conclussion of this assignment.I must only 
not forget to tell you that confidentiality in this business is very important to both parties. 
I did not include my phone contact because any phone contact is for the military prison and therefore,not safe.This e-mail 
address is the only reliable private contact I have here for now.I also have the right to occassional access to phone and internet 
for recreational purposes though the chances are limited.I implore you to consider this proposal as urgently as possible and give 
me a feedback so that we can expedite action in good time. If you are in favour of my proposal,please,do include your private 
contact information - phone,email address to facilitate a more effective and confidential communication.I implore you to ponder 
over this proposal as urgently as possible and get back to me. 
Do not forget to pray fervently for my acquitance.I wish you the best as 
I await your reply. 
Thanks, 
Best Regards, 
Steve Moore(Col).

Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive
Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources.
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a
transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality
and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the
South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government
delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable
credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret
because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%
of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous
expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above
Tel/Fax number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you
are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong 
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this
business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Tambo

Chesson Family Corporation, 
Liberia. 
email: chesson_joseph@yahoo.com

Kindest attention, I am very sorry for the informal
manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable
and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem
strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence
and pray that you take my request very serious.I am
Mr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J.
F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to
1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12
other Liberian Government officials was assassinated
as a result of a military coup that toppled the
government of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. May
his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family
has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.
You can view our family web page below; 
(http://www.chessonfamily.com/chessonfamilypage.htm)
but please do not call me 
on the tel/fax number below as the number is presumed
bugged by the government.

I received information from a reliable source that
described your country as being economically conducive
for investment and her people as transparent and
trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to
write you. As you may want to know and to make you
less curious, I got your email address from an
Internet site that portrayed you in good light. 
Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the
removal of
President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good
example of a bad leader. The President who needed
support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum
of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$
28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation
for my late father and solicited for my support. I
quickly made an arrangement with a courier company
here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset
management company in 
the uk. I did not support
President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not
for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in
Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my
family under travel watch,confiscated all our
traveling documents and frozen all our account in
Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia
and different peace keeping meetings were held and
President Taylor was advised to step down for national
peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles
Taylor flied into exile but the problem we are having
now is that he handed over power to his Vice-President
Moses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He was
the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all
our traveling documents and frozen all our account in
Liberia. That is why I requested for your sincere
assistance pending when a fresh election will be held
here. The main rebel faction Liberians United for
Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed to
continue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. The
rebels are not happy with the above development so
they still continued fighting. 

WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer the
ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the
cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through
my Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims to
the money as my proxy from the company in europe.

The entire operation is risk free since it is only you
and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the
money after you must have taken the money to your
country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you
in your country to use my share of the money for
investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is
needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission
of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for
the expected services and assistance. Your private fax
and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy
conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life
now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above
email address is highly needed so as to stop further
contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to
exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter
extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision
while I await your prompt response. Our phone line
both home and abroad are bugged. So dont call me. I
will always call you at my convenient time and in a
conducive atmosphere. PLS REPLY TO  chesson_joseph@yahoo.com

J.Rodney Chesson. JR.

MR. MARK ELLIS
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
CCTB BANK, LONDON-ENGLAND.
PRIVATE EMAIL: mark_7ell6@yahoo.co.uk

ATTENTION,

RE: YOUR ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED IN ACTUALIZING THIS GOAL

Let me start by introducing myself. I am MR. MARK ELLIS, CHIEF FINANCIAL 
OFFICER of the CITY CENTER TRUST BANK.I have an obscured business suggestion 
for you.

I honestly apologize and hope I did not cause you much embarrassment by 
contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude, but 
this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium, 
sorry my English is not very good. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client 
MAJOR FADI EL AMIN who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made 
a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Ten 
millions United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several 
Notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year.

Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came 
from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed 
during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that MAJOR FADI EL AMIN 
did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper 
work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at 
my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Ten 
millions United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever 
come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws 
of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the 
ownership of the England Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a 
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to MAJOR FADI EL AMIN so that you will 
be able to receive his funds.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this 
issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account 
we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be 
interested please let me know and finally after that I shall provide you 
with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

MRS. MARIAM <ma2320024@zipmail.com.br>,rrrrr <R@M>,"Fri, 04 Feb 2005 01:08:54 -0500",MRS. MARIAM !!!,"Dear Sir,

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business. It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below: May I first introduce my self: I am Dr.(Mrs.) MARIAM ABACHA, the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former Military head of state and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June 1998. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband. I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person , I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$8 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).

This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping. This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons. it is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation ""FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM"" (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf. On your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta, the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in Swizerland,UK,Australia. In fact, the attack on our family (The Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport ,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband.

In view of this grievous threat to our Economic and personal survival, our family trustee have secretly protected the will ,The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very soon. but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas accuount, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation. In the meantime, there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we annot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of the total amount of $8 Million US Dollars. In that case,when the money ($8 Million) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour ,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incur or tax as your government may require . The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future. My cousin (Dr.yemi musa) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation. What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner. And in due course, all contacts must be made through cousin Dr yemi musa whom is presently staying in Senegal through this E-mail: ma23200210@zipmail.com.br and ma232002@box.az and phone:+221-5478858.I look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co-operation. In view of all above details, I request you to keep this letter and co-operation highly confidential.

Best wishes,

He has not left any stone unturned in accruing riches for his family.

The present democratic government of Nigeria led by President (Gen.) (Rtd)Olusegun Obasanjo has not find favour with my family since their inception.

He has confiscated and frozen all my family account in Nigeria and some other American, Europe and Asian continents, It has been in both the local and international news.

Re: Urgent Assistance Needed

By way of introduction I am Eng. Farouk Al-Bashar, I represent my family as the oldest son of the Al-Bashar family, who are the descendants of Ibrahim Al-Bashar Ali from one of the oil rich areas in Iraq. Over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the exploration of oil in our region but over the past 15 years, Saddam Hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. In the wake of the Gulf War of 1990, our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that Saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber underground, where it remained safe until after the war. At the end of Gulf war, we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in Baghdad, where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with America.

We pray they remove Saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here, but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from Iraq without Saddam knowing. The problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling US$12.5 Million in cash from here.

We are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs America is coming to Baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money, so we need you to help in securing a private collection agency who would come to Iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west, where our family is planning to relocate to as life in Iraq is no longer worth living because of Saddam.

I have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family, if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a US Marine. The private collection agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. Hoping the American campaign would be successful, we would then come over to your country
for a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner.

For your assistance with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds, however if this does not suit you we are open for negotiation.

We eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action.

Regards.

Eng. Farouk Al- Bashar
For the entire Al-Bashar family

Mr. Christian Ubanah <chris_ubanah4group@ciudad.com.ar>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Mon, 12 Dec 2005 12:33:31 -0800",From: Mrs. Comfort Usman Wase,"My Email: Mrs_comfort_Usmanwase@ciudad.com.ar

Hello Sir,

I am Mrs. Comfort Usman Wase, widow of the late Col. Usman Wase, son of the Emir of Wase, Plateau State, Nigeria. My late husband was the Military Administractor of Kano State during the reign of the late General Sani Abacha. He died in the ill-fated Executive Air Services EAS aircraft that crashed at the Heipan airport near Jos, the Plateau state capital. My late husband was close to the then Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and he enjoys regular largesse from the Head of State as the Military Administrator of Kano State where the president came from.

Regularly, my late husband bags these largesse in local and foreign currencies to his village (Wase) where they are stored in big trunk boxes in his father Emir's palace.  These funds were so staggering that the Emir, my late husband's father advised him to make silos for the funds. 12 large overhead water tanks were made in the premises of the Emir's Palace and all the funds were transferred and stored there. The funds in the silos were top secret between my late husband and his father whom he deceived into believing that the money belong to General Sani Abacha, the then Head of State.  

After my late husband's death in the ill-fated air craft on 7th January, 1997 leaving his large fortune unprotected. The head of State General Sani Abacha paid a condolence visit to the Emir, my late husband's father, the old man believing that the fund in the silos belongs to the head of state and knowing how brutal he was at that time informed the head of state of the money his son has been keeping for him. He thanked the old man and ordered the money to be moved to Aso Rock - Abuja (Government House at the Federal Capital Territory). The money was removed with special army bullion vans in the most bizarre manner that nothing was left for us (the family) to inherit. To us on that day, it was like another river has emptied its water into the ocean.  Our problems (me and my children) started from that day.

I have just been informed by my late husband's attorney, our family attorney Barrister I.K. Saggay, Principal Partner - Casefile & Co. that my late husband operated secret domiciliary account with fictitious name in one of the commercial banks and all the funds amounting to has been credited in his favour and I the widow was nominated as the next of kin as stated in his WILL and last testament. He has now instructed me to seek in confidence a foreign partner who will assist me in transferring the funds abroad to secure the future and education of my children. The attorney has said that the conditional is very favourable for the fund to be transferred.

In the light of the above, I would like you to contact me if you are interested in this project so that I can direct you to our family attorney who will furnish you with further details and the modalities on how the fund can be wired to your bank account. You will be at liberty to negotiate a commission for your assistance with our family attorney. On the contrary, if this proposal does not meet your requirement or you are not interested, please do not hesitate to inform us so that we can make an alternative arrangement.

Kind regards,
Mrs. Comfort Usman Wase

Lagos-Nigeria.
24/2/04.

Dear Sir,
I am Mr. John Obi, I work with Standard Financial
Trust in Lagos 
office.
I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you. On 
July
6, 1999, our customer/Civil Engineer with the BM
Interiors Corporation 
Company,
Mr. Charles Anderson made a numbered time (Fixed)
Deposit for twelve 
calendar
months, valued at US$11, 450, 000, 00 and in our
Bahamas branch.  Upon 
maturity,
our bank in Bahamas sent a routine notification to us
here in Nigeria 
and
we forwarded it to his forwarding address but got no
reply.   After a 
month,
we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract 
employers,
the BM Interiors Corporation Company that Mr. Charles
Anderson died 
from
an automobile accident. On further investigation, I
found out that he 
died
without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his
next of kin were 
fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Charles 
Anderson
did not declare any kin or relations in all his
official documents, 
including
his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$11,450,000.00 is 
still
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the 
principal
sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come
forward to claim 
it.
 According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5
(five) years, the 
money
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government if nobody 
applies
to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as
an individual to 
stand
in as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Anderson so that
the fruits of 
this
old man's labour will not get into the hands of some
corrupt government
officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide
immediately your

1] name and contact adress
2] your private telephone and fax number

 so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary
documents and 
affidavits
which will put you in place as the next of kin.   We
shall employ the 
service
of two lawyers for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and to obtain 
the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor 
for
the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world
which you will 
provide
will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you
as the 
beneficiary/next
of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for
us to share in 
the
ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you while 5% is for
expenses.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will 
be
done by the lawyer and my position in the bank
guarantees the 
successful
execution of this transaction. If you are interested,
please reply 
immediately
via email address above.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this 
transaction
would be most profitable for both of us because I
shall require your 
assistance
to invest my share in your country.
Thanks and regards.

FROM MRS RAMA IDRIS <rama1@whipmail.com>,R@M,"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 10:48:15 +0000",Dear Confidant,"FROM: MRS RAMA IDRIS

In Lordship. I am the above named person from Tunisia
but now undergoing medical treatment.

I was married to Dr.Roberts IDRIS who worked with
Malaysia embassy in ABIDJAN
for nine years, before he died in the year 2002. We
were both married for
eleven years without children.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his
death we were both Christians and since his death I
decided not to re-marry.
When my late husband was alive he deposited
the sum of USD5,500,000.00 (Five Million Five Hundred
Thousand United
States Dollars) with a  African Devlopment bank
   I will send you details as
soon as you indicate your interest.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for
the next Six months
due to my cancer illness. Having known my condition
and believing the doctor I have decided to donate
this fund to avoid total loss to church, Less
privilege,
or better still a Christian individual that
will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct
herein.

I want interested church or individual that will
receive and use this money to help churches,
orphanages ,widows and propagating the Gospel and to
ensure that the house
of God is maintained.

Please do not fail to spread the funds across the
globe
especially AFRICA as soon as you receive the money.

The Bible made us to understand
that it is more
blessed to give than to receive. I took this decision
because I don't have
any child that will inherit this money and my husband
relatives are fighting
over the properties and I don't want my husband's hard
earned money to be
misused by their greedy attitude. I don't want a
situation where this money
will be used in an UNGODLY manner, hence the reason
for taking this bold
decision. I am not afraid of death since I am a good
christian. I know
that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my
peace. I don't need any telephone communication in
this regard because of my
health, and because of the presence of my husband's
relatives around me
always. I don't want them to know about this
development. With God all
things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I
shall give you the
contact information of the bank
and other details that will enable you claim
the funds.please i want you to be aware that according to my attorney
there are some important document that will be required by the bank for the transfer this is where i will need your little assistance before the fund can be transfer with the help of my attorney.

I will also issue you a letter of authority/Power of
Attorney that will make you the beneficiary
of this fund. I want you to always pray for me
because the lord is my
shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a
worthy
Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must
serve him in spirit and
truth. Please always be prayerful all through your
life.

I sent you this mail under severe pains. Any delay in
your reply will be detrimental.
Please assure me that you will
act accordingly.

Hoping to hear from you immediately.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

Yours in Christ,
Mrs. Rama idris.

OFFICE /CHAMBER: 112, LAW BUILDING COMPLEX ,VICTORIA ISLAND LAGOS.

Dear Sir/Madam

SUBJECT: THINK ABOUT IT

REPLY TO: j.m@mail.lawguru.com

I am Barrister J.T.Martins ( S A N ), a legal Solicitor. I was the Personal Attorney and legal adviser to Late Engr. Steven Cox, a national of your country, who used to work with Mobil Oil Company Nigeria Plc. Briefly, I got your contact when I accompanied our Minister of Justice to your country recently for global council of ministers meeting .On the 21st of August 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Port Harcourt /Benin Express Road on their way for relocation to Warri Refinary where he was transfered by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Honestly,all  the occupants in the vehicle inccidentally lost their lives. 

Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved very unsuccessful. However, after these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. 

Particularly, the bank where the deceased had a deposit valued at about fourty Million United States Dollars (US$40,000,000)with account no.0036577899, has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin to Late Engr. Cox, or have the account confiscated within the next fourteen(14) official banking days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for almost one year now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased, Late Engr. Stephen Cox. 

Since my late client is of your national and you can easily undertake the required assistance which I will provide to you answer to any question the board of the bank might ask, so that the proceeds of this account valued at fiften Million United States Dollars (US$15,000,000) can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 55% to me and 40% to you, while 5% should should be set aside for expenses or tax as your Government may require.
I wish to remind you that whatever share I have will authomatically be invested in your country under your advise and guidiance.
NOTE: that I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. 

In view of the above, all I require is your honest Cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me only through my private email:ONLY

I am the chairman of the contract award committee of the oil ministry here in Nigeria, for security reasons, I may not wish to disclose how I got your email address for now.

After due deliberation with my partner, I decided to forward to you this business proposal, we want you to assist us receive the sum of 
Twenty eight million, six hundred thousand united state bills
(us28.6m) into your account. This fund resulted from an over-invoiced contract awarded by us under the budget allocation to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the concerned ministries. The contract was executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid his actual cost of the contract. Now, we are left with the balance of us28.6m as the over invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our own use. Please note that the law forbids civil servants to operate or own foreign accounts hence this contact, we have agreed to share the money in the following percentages: 30 for you, 60 for us 10 for tax as may be required by your government.

Note that this transaction is very much free from all sorts of risk hence the business was carefully planned before it was successfully executed and we the officials involved in the deal have put many years in service to our ministry. We have been exercising patience for this privilege for so long not until the presidential announcement last week, that all foreign contractors owed be paid forthwith, this will enable the presidency reconcile our debt ratio with the outside world and to most of us, this is a lifetime blessing we cannot afford to miss. Upon indication of your interest to fully co-operate with us, a payment application/information form will be sent to you via email for completion. 
Note that the following information: a) bankers name and address, b) account number and account name and c) your private phone number and email address will enable us seek/secure approval of the fund from the concerned government quarters/ministries within 3-4 banking days. 

As soon as we confirm receipt of this money in your nominated bank account, my partner and I will come over to your country to arrange for our own share and possibly invest part of this money in your country.

Let honesty and trust be our watchword throughout this transaction. I shall furnish you with some details about myself. Your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.  

Best regards.

Dear Friend,
 It is my great pleasure in writing you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. Your information was given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Federal Government delegation on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a
confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
here under for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business
Within the Department of Minerals an Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue
payment in US funds.
 The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign
contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$14.500,000.00Dollars.Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.
 Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed so as to maintain good relationship with foreign government and non-government agencies, we include our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa. We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.
  I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$3.625m (25%), while my colleagues and I receive US$9.425m  (65%) and the balance of US$1.450m (10%) for taxation and miscellaneous expenses incurred.
 The business itself is 100% safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favor of You/your Company. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed
my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.

Good day,

Forgive this unusual manner of contacting you, but this particular letter is of exceptional and very private nature. 
I am  Richard Akintunde, the Secretary/Legal Adviser of the Zambia Overseas Task Force on Foreign Payments. The Task Force was set up by President LEVY MWANAWASA of Zambia on January, 2004 with the definite assignment of verifying/ratifying all claims for settlements made by Foreign Contractors and hence effecting Payments accordingly. Our terms of reference include all Contracts executed between 1991 and 2001 when Dr. Frederick Chiluba was the President. Former President Chiluba is currently standing trial for embezzlement of public fund while in office. President MWANAWASA had to launch a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign. All the Contracts (Foreign and Indigenous) awarded under the tenure of Chiluba are being reviewed now, as there were many bogus claims. However, some claims are legitimate. At the moment, we know precisely, the Claims that are legitimate and otherwise. As soon as we concluded our review, verifications and ratifications in Lusaka, Zambia,President MWANAWASA man

dated the Task Force to 

In the course of doing our work  reviewing and scrutinizing, we discovered many bogus claims. In deed, we want to pay a sum being a bogus claim into the Account of a relaible and honest person (personal or company) who will be fronted as a Foreign Contractor that satisfactorily executed a contract during Chilubas tenure. We have the instruments to create a perfect semblance of genuineness; hence the transaction will be hitch-free, risk free and quite beneficial to all parties involved. I want you to receive this money as the beneficiary.
I will need ultimately; your full name and address to commence work that will culminate in your being recognized as the Foreign Contractor and beneficiary of fund, your private telephone and fax numbers to enhance communication and occupation . I will also need a reassurance that you have the capacity to do this transaction (receive this money) without raising eyebrows. You will be adequately compensated for your assistance. It will take about two weeks to conclude this transaction. I will inform you the details and modus operandi when you reply.
I implore you to accord it the confidentiality it deserves. Expecting your urgent and positive response, as we have limited time to carry out our assignment in London before going back to Zambia. 

Whatever your actions and your decision, I thank you for taking the time to read my email.

no beneficiary at present and investigations proved that his company does not 
know anything about the account. The total amount is US$75.5M (seventy Five

need your assistance in this rare opportunity by providing your Bank account

 Hello,

 My name is Mrs Maryam Ibrahim,owner of MARYAM 
 IBRAHIM TEXTILES TRADING, TAILORING & EMBROIDERY
 Po Box 34285 Dubai,United Arab Emirates.Am 58years old,
 suffering from long time cancer of the breast.
 From all indications my condition is really
 deteriorating and it's quite obvious that I won't
 live more than 2 months according to my doctors.
 This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a
 very bad stage.
  
 My late husband died early last year from
 heart attack, and during the period of our marriage
 we couldn't produce any child. My late husband was
 very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business 
 and wealth.The doctor has advised me that I
 will not live for more than 2 months, so I have now
 decided to spread all my wealth, to contribute mainly
 to the development of charity in Africa, America, Asia
 and Europe.

 Before my late husband died he was a major oil tycoon,
 in dubai and deposited the sum of 20 million dollars
 (Twenty million dollars) in a security company in europe some
 years ago,thats all i have left now,i need you to collect this funds 
 and distribute it yourself to charity.
 so that when i die my soul can rest in peace.
 the funds will be entirely in hands and management.
 I pray God gives you the wisdom to touch
 very many lives,that is my main concern.
 
 20% of this money will be for your time and effort,
 while 80% goes to charity.

 God bless you.

,susantom24@yahoo.co.jp,,Donation From Mrs Susan Thompson,"  ATTN: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCEREN
     
Dear One in Christ,
  Good day, I am sorry to take your time and to disturb you. I am Mrs Susan Thompson ,from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Eric Thompson, who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Six years before he died in the year 2001,after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. We were married for Eighteen years with a duaghter (Lilian) who later died in a motor accident.
   
  Before the untimely death of my husband,we were both born again Christians. Since after his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of (US$4.8 M )(Four
Million,Eight hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a General Trust Account with a prime bank in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. Presently,this money is still with the bank. 
   
  Recently,Following my ill health, my Doctor told me that I may not last for the next eight months due to my cancer problem.The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a  Christain organization (Church) or individual beleiver
that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein,according to the desire of my latehusband before his death.
   
  I want this fund to be used in Christain Activities like,Orphanages, Christain schools, and Churches for propagating  the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God  is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that ""Blessed is the hand that giveth"". I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision.  
   
  I am not afraid of death  hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want them to know about this development.With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. 
   
  I want you and the members of your Church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. 
  Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply. 
  Remain blessed in the Lord. 
  Yours in Christ, 
Mrs Susan Thompson.

Dear Friend, 
 
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is MR. REZA ABDULLA , a merchant in Safat, in (Kuwait) I was married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand American dollars (U.S.$10.700,000) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will
want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set
aside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5% as miscellaneous expenses. Reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address: mr4rezaabdulla@walla.com
 
 
God be with you.
Regards,
MR. REZA ABDULLA

On routine audit check last month, I discovered some investment accounts that has been dormant for the last twelve(12) years. All the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above ($17.1 Million United States Dollars) plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in Ireland demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal. 

My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1993�the exact time the account was last operated, I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died interstate and no next�of�kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years. 

I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working with you can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Irish Government. This is especially possible as you bear the same LAST NAME to the said investor, and can stand as his extended relative. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation. 

I have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with have agreed to allocate a 30% of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses. 

I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate. 

Be assured that me and my colleagues are on top of the situation. 
There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. 

To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction come to a successful conclusion, I have intentionally left out the finer details. 

To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal, please contact me through telephone, fax or email stating the followings: 

(1) Full Name; 

(2) Telephone and Fax Number; 

(3) Postal Address 

(4) Occupation; 

(5) Date of Birth; 

Your prompt response will be highly appreciated. 

Regards, 

Mrs. Maureen Foley.

My dear Friend, 


I am highly compelled upon strict recommendation, to write you this very 
urgent and confidential letter.I do hope my letter will not embarrass you
since I had no previous correspondence with you.I hope this mail will not 
come to you as a surprise.


I am sending this proposal with due sense of humanity, responsibility and
with few awareness that you will give it a sympathetic attention. I regree
t the inconvenience it may cause you base on the condition that we have not 
met before. 


I am Mrs. Salatu Mustapha, the wife of Al Mustapha, personal assistant to the Late head of state of Federal Republic of Nigeria - General Sani Abacha.I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other like wise developing a cordial relationship.


My husband along with the head of state and top officials of their past administration has been accused of looting several Billion United States 
Dollars from the Nigeria Government. The current attitude of the present government towards my family has indeed made life quite unbearable for us.


Fortunately, Al Mustapha my Husband has Six million and eight hundred thousa
nd United States Dollars(US$6.8 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. This money is kept in a private security company. 


This money was deposited for safe keeping in the security vault of a freighting agency here by my husband preparotry to being air lifted abroad 
for investment purposes before his arrest leaving a clause that it could only be claimed by an expertriate partner. It is only my husband and myself that know where the money is kept. 


Due to the current situation in the country concerning governments vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer this money out of Nigeria for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband.


Note that my family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation of public funds during their regime.Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying out
financial transactions without their 
express permission is in force.


Right now, my husband (Al Mustapha) is under arrest and is being detained in
connection to the above and other activities of his late Boss.
However, I have an arrangement on how to freight this money to you after receiving some assurances from you of the safety our own share and that you 
will only take the commission that we will offer you.


This money personally belongs to my husband and he intends that it still 
be used for investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, nei
ther is the money traceable by the government because there
is no Documentation concerning the funds in the Federal Treasury. 


The freighting company to be used has now been introduced to me and as so
on as we recieve your readiness to assist us recieve this fund we shall 
formalize the deposit documents in your name and reach an agreement with
them to air lift the consignment for your pick up.


Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we 
propose a commission of 15%(Fifteen Percent) of the total sum to you for 
the expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped out
for miscellaneous expenses.


On your positive consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to 
enable us discuss about this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must 
use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep 
this matter extraordinarily confidential, while I await your prompt response.


Best regards,


MRS. SALATU AL MUSTAPHA

Mr. Simon Robson <simonrobson01@web2mail.com>,,"Fri, 09 Feb 2007 19:20:09 -0500",+From Portugal & Urgent Reply Needed +,"



>From . Mr. Simon Robson.
Date: 10 - 2 - 2007.

Kindest Attention:

My name is Mr. Simon Robson. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed
with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and
right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical
experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really
cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich,
I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on
my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all
this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or
make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second
chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how
I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few
close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I
have decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I
want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have
Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that
my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I
once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute
the money which I have there to charity organization in United States,
Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with
what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is
the huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000,
000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I
will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity
organizations and use it to help those in Need.

N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami,
Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to
other Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and
time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am
using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to
this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my
behalf.

God be with you.

Mr. Simon Robson.

25 Maiden Lane 
Covent Garden 
London WC2E 7JS


Hello,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.
I will introduce myself as Mr.Robbin Kuuk, a staff in the accounts management
section of the above firm here in the United Kingdom. 

One of our accounts with holding balance of £15,000,000(Fifteen Million
British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past
four (4) years. 

>From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account, a foreigner
by name Kurt Kahle died in July, 2000  and since then nobody has done anything
as regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members who
are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds. 

I have secretly discussed this matter with a senior official of this company
and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus
propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these
funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have
been followed. 

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate
and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other
illegal act. On receipt of your response I will furnish you with detailed
clarification as it relates to this mutual benefit transaction. I look forward
to hearing from you as soon as possible if you are interested.
 

Regards, 

Mr.Robbin Kuuk

Dr.Edward Hilson. <konsult_edward@yahoo.co.uk>,R@M,"Thu, 19 Aug 2004 22:14:00 -0000",I WISH TO CONTACT YOU ON THIS ISSUE.,"ATTN: PLEASE,

My name is Edward, I am a consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my client bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH
JULY,2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with
the whole passengers on board.

During the course of my auditing work with my client bank, I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows
about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company.

The total amount involved is $36,000,000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without any
disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.

I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of
the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred.

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. 

In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in
his or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.

Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.

When you receive this letter. I look forward to your earliest reply through  my private email address:  konsultedward@ureach.com and telephone number +874 763 593 620. Fax number +874 763 593 621.Just add your international dial out code number and you will get through.

You should also include your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.

Respectfully yours,

Dr.Edward Hilson.

I am DR H.B OHAMS,one of the very many accountants of The Nigeria

There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of multinationals in the oil ndustry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
The original value of some contracts done for my corperation were delebrately over invoiced for OUR own use in the sum $29mUSD (twenty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the
companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests
were officially commissioned.
It does not matter whether your company did the contract or not, the assumption
is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other ompanies.

MR. JACK ALAN <jack_a004@walla.com>,R@M,"Tue, 12 Sep 2006 00:29:27 -0700",RE:INVESTMENT!!,"Dear Sir, 
Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, I am Mr. Alan Jack a Zimbabwean Farmer. 
I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed, just as reported by the International media. 
This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 white farmers were killed; the government didn't stop at this, as just recently the government has asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. 
Therefore, I decided to contact you through my local Zimbabwean associate (Mr. Dennis Udongo) for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country. For this purpose, I have deposited in a Security Company based in Amsterdam (Holland) all the funds realized from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD18, 500,000.00 (Eighteen million, five hundred United States Dollars). These funds was packaged in two metal boxes and declared as personal effects and photographic materials so as to avoid detection by immigration/security officials. For now, I stay in Asia, because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my family. Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the Security Company in UAE Dubai. 
Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and genuine and should also be handled in the most confidential manner. This proposal is NOT and must NOT be linked to all the numerous SCAM letters flying around the internet world today. The money (USD18.5m) already stashed in the two boxes could be termed as consignment and I will not hesitate to link you to my safe contact in the security company for further discussion. Lest I forget, you should be entitled to 30% of the total funds for your support and cooperation in the transaction. It�s also your duty to assist me in investing my own share of the money in your company or in your country. I shall be counting on your unalloyed trust and immediate response. 
Best Regards and God bless.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,
OFFSHORE OFFICE,OUAGADOUGOU,
BURKINA-FASO.

Dear Friend,

I am the Bill and Exchange(assistant) Manager of the Africa development 
Bank,
In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of USD$11.300.000 (ELEVEN 
MILLION THREE HUNDERS U.S.A DOLLARS). In an account that belongs to one of 
our foreign customer who died along with his wife and two children in July 
2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have 
been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we 
cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation 
to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we 
learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him 
in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

                          You can also confirm this in the website as 
follow:

                      http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

It is therefore upon this discovery that I in my department now decided to 
make this business proposals to you and release the money to you as next of 
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates 
that if such money remains unclaimed after  five years, the money will be 
transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.
The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late 
customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a 
foreigner. We agree that 27% of this money will be for you as foreigner 
partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account,3% will be set 
aside for expenses incurred during the business and 70% would be for me and 
my colleague, after which we shall  visit your country for disbursement 
according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate 
transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank, 
and send your account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy 
and effective communication and location where  the money will be remitted.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of 
the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance 
maneger,for easy execution of the transaction.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% 
hitch-free on both side. As all required arrangement have been made for the 
transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this 
letter.

Trusting to receive your urgent reply through my alternative Email

Dear Friend,

I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a
desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of

matter.

the bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of his next of kin

clients
relatives for some time now and with no one coming forward since my
clients passing on, and with the bank now giving me a deadline, I now 
seek

With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I believe will be a great interest to you. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you.I am Mrs. Susan Martins the wife of Mr. John Martins of Zimbabwe.During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and from the support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, all the white and black farmers were ordered to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the farmer's Co-operation did not support his idea and so the party members invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm, killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm.

After the death of my husband, my children and I decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were in danger with the fund that my husband kept in his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$30,5 Million (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and we decided to move this money to the Republic of South Africa, where we deposited it with a private  Security Company as a valuables in a box/consignment. This I did for security reasons and to keep from public eyes.I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family. If you are really capable and willing to assist me as soon as you get this message please contact my son Wodi Martins immediately with the above telephone number (+27-732250444) or by email he knows also about this transaction. for details on how to execute this transaction to the satisfaction of everybody.

Attn.:  The President/CEO


I am  Dr. (Mrs.) Maryam Abacha, wife to the late
Nigeria Head of State - General Sani Abacha. I am
proposing this business to you because we could be of
great assistance to each other, likewise developing a
cordial business relatinship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of Twenty-Five
Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars 
(US$25,600,000:00)cash which I intend to 
use for investment purpose specifically in your country. 

This money came as a result of a pay back contract 
deal between my late husband and a Russian firm 
on our country's Multi-billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. 

The Russian partners returned my husband's share of
US$25.6 million after his death and lodged it with my
husband's security firm in Nigeria of which I am adirector.
Right now, the new civilian government has revoked our
licenses that allow us to own a financial and oil
company. 

In view of this, I acted very fast to
withdraw the US$25.6 million from the company's vault
well preserved and packaged in trunk boxes and
deposited it in  ECOWAS Security Bank. I have since
declared our  security company bankrupt. No record 
ever  existed concerning the money neither is the
money traceable by the government because there is no
document showing that we received the money from the
Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning
the government attitude towards my family, it has
become quite impossible for me to make use of the
money within, thus I seek your assistance to move the
money out of this country. On your consent, I shall
expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that
your assistance is needed to transfer this fund.
Your urgent response is highly needed.  All
correspondences must be channeled to our legal adviser

Leonard Obi Esq  through  his direct Tel. No:

234-1-4705964. I must also use this opportunity to
implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep
this transaction a confidential issue. You can also
contact me directly on  my secret  telephone:-234-1-4705964
if there is need.

Thanks and God bless you.

DONT BE OFFENDED IF I MAY HAVE DISTURBED YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES.


MY NAME IS MR NOEL PANGA, I AM A BANKER, AND I WORK WITH THE AFRICAN 
DEVELOPMENT BANK AS A SENIOR STAFF. I HAVE DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU ON A 
BUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US AT THE END 
OF THE TRANSACTION .


DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME 
ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED IN A 
PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK 
WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR 
RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT.


THE SAID AMOUNT WAS U.S 18.4M (EIGHTEEN MILLION,FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED 
STATES DOLLARS). AS IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW, I GOT YOUR IMPRESSIVE 
CONTACTS THROUGH INTERNET. MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM 
OVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, AND TRANSFER 
THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE.  THE DIRECTIVES AND 
NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR 
INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST ME, AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS 
GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.


IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS 
COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF 
TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL 
REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN 
WITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS 
REQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE 
CORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM 
TO YOUR OWN DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT.


I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.ON 
SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE 
TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF 
EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE AND 
INTERNET BILLS, WHILE 50% WILL BE FOR ME.  PLEASE, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICED TO 
KEEP ""TOP SECRET"" AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE 
AFTER WE CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU.


I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM 
THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR 
SUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED 
AND FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY COUNTRY YOU ADVICE US 
TO INVEST IN. ALL OTHER NECESSARY VITAL NFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN 
I HEAR FROM YOU.


IF THE TRANSACTION INTEREST YOU, GET BACK TO ME WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO 
CALL YOU SO WE COULD PROCEED.

William, and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank 
here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important 
business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I 
choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest 
medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and 
private, and it should be treated as such.

Atfirst I will like to 
assure you  that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both 
parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. 
THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS 
A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his eath,The Late Prime Minister, 
Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and 
all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX 
MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his 
account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The

I was on a routine inspection 
that I dscovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY 
SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on 
further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account 
holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to theaccount. The 
bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former 
operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody 
will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim 
this money with legal claims to the account Holder, therefore I need 
your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary 
information needed in order to claim this money, Hoping in God that you 
will never let me down now and in future.o.k!

times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his 
last resignation from office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri

Senior Audit Officer
Natwest Bank Group
UK.

Dear Friend,

I am Mr.Charles Greene Senior Audit Officer of Natwest Bank Group UK.
Natwest Bank London. I am writing following an opportunity in my office
that will be of immense benefit to both of us.In my department we
discovered an abandoned sum of£20.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty
million five hundred thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs
to one of our  foreign customers Late Mr.Morris Thompson an American  who
unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight
261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only
daughter.

You shall read more  about the crash on visiting this site.

http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/


Since we got information about  his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because we cannot
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only
daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the
knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this
discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to
make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or
beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement
since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into
Government treasury as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained
after eight years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as
unclaimed funds.

We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while
the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country
for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once
this money gets into your account.Please be honest to me and trust is our
watchword in this transaction.

Note this transaction is confidential and risk free.As soon as you receive
this mail you should contact me by return mail.Please note that all
necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has
been finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your
response.

Please if you are interested in this project contact me for further
directives.

Mr.Daniel Thorp made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) in a bank in Dakar, capital of Senegal with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity, the routine notification was sent to me whom I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without no reply. After a month, I sent areminder which I received from the bank without any reply again. 

Finally, I discovered from my client�s contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January, 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan, Cote D�Ivoire. On further investigations, I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that Mr. Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal.

I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr. Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man�s labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal.

I wish to point out that after the claims, I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly, I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice. 

If you are interested, please contact me via my email address :davidchambers@katamail.com. Upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email.

Thanks & Regards

Dr.David Clovis (Esq.)

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.

Attention Please,

I am Musa Garuba, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section 
of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. 
With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business 
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the 
transaction .

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank 
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this development.

The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand 
United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your 
impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole 
arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the 
deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign 
account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be 
relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to 
assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from 
to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and 
internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have 
been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when 
I hear from you.

I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,

Yours faithfully,

Musa Garuba.

habib waheed <habibwaheed77@yahoo.gr>,R@S,"Thu, 25 May 2006 17:51:14 +0000",FOR THY LORD,"Έχω καινούργια διεύθυνση email!Τώρα μπορείτε να μου στέλνετε email στη διεύθυνση: habibwaheed77@yahoo.gr



 From . Mr.Habib Waheed.

Date 25-04-2006.

Kindest Attention:

 

My name is Mr. Habib Waheed. I am from Dubai . I have been diagnosed with 

Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right 

now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I 

have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 

anyone (not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never 

generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as 

that was the only thing I cared for.

 

But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just 

wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives 

me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different 

way from how I have lived it.

 

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and 

assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close 

friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have 

decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want 

this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.

 

So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was 

well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself 

anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and 

distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United 

States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to 

themselves.

 

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with 

what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the 

huge cash deposit of ten Million United States Dollars ($10, 000, 

000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I 

will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity 

organizations and use it to help those in Need.

 

N/B:Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of Tsunami, 

Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other 

Charity Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort and time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am 

using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to 

this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my 

behalf.

 

God be with you.

Mr.Habib Waheed

princess silvee09 <princess_silvee09@hotmail.com>,,"Wed, 12 Jul 2006 09:45:24 +0000",WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU SOONEST.,"Dear Friend,

Good day and Compliments.

I am writing this letter in confidence believing that if it is the wish of 
God for you to help me and my family,God almighty will bless and reward you 
aboundantly and you would never regreat this.

I am a female student from University of Burkina-Faso,Ouagadougou.I am 25 
yrs old.I'd like any person who can be caring,loving and home oriented.I 
will love to have a long-term relationship with you and to know more about 
you.I would like to build up a solid foundation with you in time coming if 
you can be able to help me in this transaction.

Well,my father died on 5th May 2005 and left I and my junior brother behind. 
He was a king, which our town citizens titled him over sixteen years before 
his death.

I was a princess to him and I am the only person who can take care of his 
wealth now because my junior brother is still young and my mother is not 
literate enough to know all my father's wealth. He left the sum of USD 
7,350, 000.00 dollars (seven Million, Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand US 
Dollars),in a security company.This money was annually paid into my late 
fathers account from Shell petroleum development company(SPDC)and chevron 
oil company operating in our locality for the compensation of youth and 
community development in our jurisdiction.

I don't know how and what I will do to invest this money somewhere in 
abroad,so that my father's kindred will not take over what belongs to my 
father and our family,which they were planning to do without my present 
because I am a female as stated  by our culture in the town.

Now,I urgently need your humble assistance to move this money from the 
security company to your bank account and I strongly believe that by the 
grace of God,you will help me invest this money wisely.

I am ready to pay 20% of the total amount to you if you help us in this 
transaction and another 10% interest of Annual After Income to you,for 
handling this transaction for us,which you will strongly have absolute 
control over.

If you can handle this project sincerely and also willing to assist me in 
lifting this fund,kindly reach me.You can reach me through this email 
id.(princess_silvee2006@yahoo.com).



Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free and I hope to commence 
the transaction as quick as possible, I will send you my picture as soon as 
I hear from you.

Yours sincerely,

Princess  Silvee.

Alhaji Yusuf A <yusuf_adamah@yahoo.com>,aiweb06@cs.umbc.edu,"Sun, 20 Aug 2006 01:32:28 +0100",URGENT REPLY NEEDED!!!,"Dear Friend, 

Let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I 
am Alhaji Yusuf Adamah, I work with the United Bank 
for Africa UBA as an account officer in the Treasury/
Credit Control Unit. I came to know you in private search
for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential 
transaction, which involve the transfer of a huge sum of 
money into a foriegn account requiring maximum confidence. 

I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, by virtue of 
its nature that is utterly confidential and secret. Though I know
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be 
well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the
fact that this transaction is urgent, as I will rely on your ability in
handling a transaction of this nature. 

THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSITION / TRANSACTION:
A foreigner by name Andreas Schranner , who is a real 
estate and property developer by profession executed certain
contract/supply with the Government of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria in 1998. The payment for the executed contract had 
been approved and deposited with our bank in an Escrow account 
with us at UBA and had a closing balance as at the end of January 
2000, which is worth ($27M) Twenty seven Million United States Dollars.

I was his personal account officer and since the government deposited 
this money with us in the year 1999, We were instructed by my late 
client that the money be kept and secured in a security and finance firm 
because it was less expensive to keep and secure the funds in the 
security firm devoid of tax payments. 

I am sad to inform you that Mr Andreas Schranner, his wife, daughter, 
daughter inlaw and children died in the ill fated concorde flight AF4590 
that crashed into Hotelisimmo on the 31st of July 2000 in Paris-France. 
Check this website below: 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm 

Our bank now expects his Next of Kin to come forward as a sole 
beneficiary to his assets with the bank as accordingto banking laws, 
such fund which has stayed more than 5 years without any claim will be 
terminated and be used by the bank as unclaimed fund. Mean while, as is 
personal account officer valuable efforts has being made by me for more than 
three years to get in touch with any of my late client family or relatives without 
any success.It is because of the percieved impossibility of being able to locate 
any of my late client Next of Kin as his wife Maria Schranner and his daughter
Eich Andreas perished in the flight also. 

Based on this, I secretly seek advice from a fellow coleague who has being in 
banking for about 14 years now about this issue of my late client , he made me 
understand that things like this do happen and at the end of the day the chairman 
and board of directors of the bank will declare the funds as '' Unclaimed '' and 
subsequently divert it for thier personal use. In order to avert this negetive 
development, I now seek your permission to have you stand as the Next of Kin 
to my late client, so that the funds will be released and paid into your account as 
the beneficiary Next of Kin. 

I have already secured from the probate, as soon as I recieve an acknowledgement 
of your acceptance, I will furnish you with the necessary modalities of the transaction. 
I assure you that this transcaction is 100% risk free, and as soon as we succeed in 
getting this funds to your account, I shall take a trip to meet with you in your country 
and the money will be shared on a 85% for me and 15% for you. We could go into
joint investment based on your advice. 

Please forward to me on acceptance of this proposal, your private telephone and fax 
number including the country code and area codes, your complete names,and 
private email address for effective communication as the project will be completed 
within the next 14 working days. 

Please, treat with absolute maturity, kindness and reservation even though you are
not interested to work with me, waiting to hear from you soonest.

Thanks for your anticipated response.

Best Regards. 

Alhaji.Y.Adamah

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO


I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department
of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK BURKINA FASO. I got your contact address
through internet net work search when searching for a good and reliable
person that will assist me in this transaction.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22.85m US Dollars (twenty two milllion eight hundred and Fifty thousand us dollars)in an
account thatbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died on 25th JULY
2000 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE along with his entire family.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it
unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased
as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to 
go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained
unclamed after seven year, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as
next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME;

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location where in  the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail   through
my  private line +22676524743 or  email adress  azize_ouattara25@yahoo.com

N0 10 Mandela Avenue  Johannesburg
South Africa 
ATTN:Sir/Madam
 
You may be surprise to receive this latter since you do not know me personally .I got your contact through Johannesburg chamber of commerce .I am Mr. Johnson Moyo the son of late Dr. Raymond Moyo who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe .my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmer who was murdered in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for allegedly supporting the party controlled by the white minority.
 
Before the death of my father he had taken to Johannesburg, republic of South Africa the sum of US$10m  (Ten million united state dollars) and deposited it with a private security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money is contained in a trunk box and he registered it as
family treasures and valuables for adequate security reason. 
 
The fund was meant to purchase new agricultural machines and chemicals for farming in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land dispute sparked off when president Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected he white farmer and some few black who vehemently condemned the modus oparandi adopted by the government, added with their party status. This resulted to rampage and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs in which more than fifty-one (51) people were killed including my father. May his soul rest in perfect peace. Heads of governments from the west especially Britain and America have voiced their condemnation against ugabes plan.
As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine partner and account where this money will be transferred with out exposing the whole situation. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have the almost the same political history. Moreso, South Africa monetary laws dose not allow
refuges/asylum seeker to engage on any  business activities neither are they allowed to open any bank account. Therefore, I am seeking for your very good assistance to transfer this money out of South Africa into your overseas chosen account. For your effort and assistance I have made up my mind to offer you 30% of the total fund, 5% for any unforeseen expenses that may occur during the process of the transaction and
65% will be for my investments in your country under your guidance.
Please should this request meet your utmost consideration kindly contact me via my e-mail and telephone above. Feel free to ask any question you consider necessary and in return try to include your private phone and fax numbers for easier nication. The confidentiality of this request can not be over emphasized as I have believe that you will oblige us in the need for security and attention it demands. Please treat this transaction with absolutely confidentiality and urgency it deserves and even if you are not in a position to render any assistance please your earlier information will be highly appreciated.
Thanks,
Yours faithfully

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A D B)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.


Dear Sir/Madam,

                        (PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL)

I am NABA MOHAMMED the MANAGER in charge of BILL AND EXCHANGE section of 
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A D B) Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso in West 
Africa.With due respect and egard I have decided to contact you on a 
business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end 
of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 
November  2001 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account 
with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his 
family or relation before my discovery to this development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself to enable 
the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of 
execution. The said amount was sum of $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED 
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3m)

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the 
Bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer 
this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and 
needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your 
interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this 
great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money 
to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification 
and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole 
money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don't 
want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.Our Banking 
law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed 
after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as 
unclaimed fund.The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is 
occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe 
cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone 
bills, while 65% will be for me. Please, you have been adviced to keep ""top 
secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I 
conclude this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in.

All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from 
you.
I look forward to receive your email.

Yours faithfully,
Mr NABA MOHAMMED HOME ADDRESS:288 QUEAZIN

>From . Mr. Simon Robson.


Kindest Attention:


My name is Mr. Simon Robson. I am from Portugal. I have been diagnosed
with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and
right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical
experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never
really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am
very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only
focused  on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I
regret
all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to
have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a
second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way
from  how I have lived it.


Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few
close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so,
Ihave decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need,
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I
have distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now
that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.
I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and
distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United
States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to
themselves.


Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with
what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is
the huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20,
000,000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company
Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to
charity organizations and use it to help those in Need.


N/B: Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of
Tsunami,Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake ,
55% to other Charity Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort
and time.


I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am
using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to
this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my
behalf.

Ibrahim Dunga <ibradunga@hotmail.com>,R@M,"Mon, 08 Nov 2004 16:48:05 +0000",Confidential,"Dear Friend,

 
I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please consider this 
letter as a request from a family in dire need for your assistance. 
Firstly, I must introduce myself, I am PRINCE IBRAHIM DUNGA from 
Zimbabwe, 
and I am the first and the only son of MR DANIEL DUNGA. I am presently 
residing in SOUTH AFRICA.

 
I got your contact from the SOUTH AFRICA INFORMATION EXCHANGE (S.A.I.E) 
in Johannesburg and on behalf of my mother who is a widow MRS ANGELA 
DUNGA. I decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of 
US$ 18.5M (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars) 
in your personal or company account. Before my father�s death, he was 
among the few black Zimbabweans rich farmers, and, he was poisoned by 
the agents of the ruling government of president ROBERT MUGABE for his 
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition party controlled 
by white minority. Before his death, he had taken me to Johannesburg to 
deposit his money to a Security and Finance Company. This money was 
deposited as a gemstone to avoid much demurrage from the Security 
Company. 
This money was earmarked for purchase of new machinery and chemicals 
for the farms and to establish new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.

 
In this will, he specifically drew my attention to this sum of US$18.5M 
(Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) that he 
deposited in safe box of a private Security and Finance Company here in 
Johannesburg, South Africa.

 
INFACT MY FATHER SAID IN HIS WILL AND QUOTE:

 
 �My beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to this money which I 
deposited in your name in a box with a Security and Finance Company in 
Johannesburg, South Africa. In case of my absence on earth caused by 
death, you should solicit for a reliable foreign partner to transfer 
this 
money out of South Africa for investment purposes.

 
>From the above, you will understand that life and future of my family 
depends on this money, as much I will be very grateful if you can 
assist 
us. We are now living in South Africa as asylum seekers and financial 
laws of South Africa does not allow asylum seekers certain right to 
such 
huge amount of money. In view of this, I can not invest this money in 
South Africa hence am asking you to assist me to transfer this money 
out 
of South Africa for investment purposes. For your effort, I am prepared 
to offer you 25% of the total fund. While 5% will be set my family and 
I will keep aside for local and international expenses and 70%. Finally 
modalities on how the transfer will be done will be conveyed to once we 
establish trust and confidence between ourselves. 

 
Looking forward to your reply including your full name, and your full 
direct phone & fax numbers, and please treat as very urgent.

 
Best Regards,

 
PRINCE IBRAHIM DUNGA.

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A).
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO
WEST AFRICA.

Dear Friend,

I am the manager of bill and exchange department  BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) In 
my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15m US dollars ( fifteen 
million US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane 
crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release 
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety 
and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want 
this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of 
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the 
business and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues.

Then after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement 
accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate 
trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank 
as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your 
bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and 
effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . 
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free 
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required 
arrangements have been made for the transfer . you should contact me 
immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you 
immediately.  PLEASE MY DEAR  FRIEND THIS IS MY PRIVATE LINE YOU CAN  CALL   
ME IMMIDEATELY YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL.  00226 (76  63  87 21)

Diamond Bank Plc
ILupeju Branch,
Lagos, Nigeria.
TEL: 234-80-433-21216,

ATTN: MD/CEO

I am Dr.(Mrs)Betty Pedro, Branch Manager Diamond Bank Plc,ILupeju Branch,
Lagos,  Nigeria.

I have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you that should
be handled with extreme confidentiality.

On January 6,1998 a Foreign  Consultant and contractor with the Nigerian
Water Corporation Mr. Marc Smith Pena by name made a numbered time Fixed
Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$40.9M(fourty Million, Nine
Hundred thousand United States Dollars Only) in my branch.

Upon maturity I sent a routine notification in accordance with the Bank
policy to his forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract
employers Nigerian Water Corporation that Mr. Marc Smith Pena died from
an automobile accident.

On further investigation, we found out that he died without making a Will
and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. 
I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Marc Smith
Pena  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.
This sum of US$40.9M has been carefully  moved out of my bank to a Financial
and Security Company in Europe for safekeeping.

No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the Law of my
country, at the expiration of 7 years the money will revert to the ownership
of the State (Government) if nobody applies to claim the fund.

We decided to contact you to receive his money and investments on his behalf
as everything will be taken over by the government as provided in section
129 sub 63(N), Nigerian Banking Edit of 1961.
This prompted us to contact you.We want to front you as the next of kin
of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of
$40.9 million U.S Dollars that is presently in a Financial and Security
Company in Europe.

I contacted you because it is against the civil service code of ethics to
own and operate foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to
claim the money in the Financial and Security Company in Europe,which also
has branches in Asia.

We have unanimously agreed that 35% of the entire sum would be for you if
you agree to take part in this profitable transaction,55% for me while the
remaining 10% would be used to pay back the expenses that may be incurred
during the course of the transaction by both parties after the fund has
been claimed and lodged in your account.

In the event that you are genuinely interested in the transaction, the following
information would be needed from you to expedite action.
1) Your Full Name .
2) Your Residential or Company Address.
3) Your Private Mobile,Telphone and Fax numbers where you can be reached
at all time because this transaction entails constant communication.

The transaction is 100% legal and totally free of risks as all modalities
has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of the transaction.

If you are interested, send the requested information via email as soon
as possible so that we can proceed and after sending it you call me.
I await your response urgently.
Regards,
Dr.(Mrs)Betty Pedro

Dear Friend,I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met before. My name is  Mr Adams   Swll.   I am the bill and exchange manager in African Development Bank. I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on 6th of august 1997 and for your perusal you can view this site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.listSince the demise of this our customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$11.3M (Eleven Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very long time.On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again. The Banking ethics here do not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because the money will be recalled to our Banks treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.In view of this I got your contact through the Internet when I was making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great opportunity because I don't want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will be for me.
The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased man was a foreigner and it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the request for you as a foreigner to come into the business is necessary, it will facilitate the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the only surviving relation to the deceased.If you are really sure of your integrity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and fax numbers and Banking account details where you wish to receive the fund.Upon receipt of the above mentioned information, indicating your interest in the business, I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application which you will type and send back to our bank to enable us start this transaction.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is risk free and doesn't have any negative implication. You should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund have been finalized. This transaction will be completed within 14 bank working days immediately we start the business.Waiting for your urgent response and please kindly delete if you are not interested.Regards, Mr Adams   Swll
African Development BankOuagadougou, Burkina Faso.

I require urgently your unreserved assistance in providing me with a
safe and reliable bank account with full details, where I can transfer
the
sum of $20.5M (Twenty million five hundred thousand United States of
American
Dollars) The purpose of the transfer is to take care of my retirement

This sum of money was generated as a result of over-invoiced contracts
awarded by my colleagues and I, and I have arranged for the money to be
remitted out through a reliable expatriate partner whom I can present
as the beneficiary, as my present status and financial resources will
not be
sufficient for me to handle the transfer successfully without the
financial assistance of a reliable foreign partner.

I got your profile from our chamber of commerce and it is with business
trust that I write to request, you partner with us to facilitate the
transfer of this money to your nominated bank account for our mutual
benefits.

Note that 20% will go to you for your efforts and your contribution, 5%
is for miscelleneous expenses incurred by both parties, and 75% will be
shared between me and colleagues which will be use for business
investment
in
your country under your supervision.

Please if you are interested kindly send to me immediately the
underlisted:
1. Name to be used as beneficiary and beneficiarys address.
2. Your private and confidential telephone/ fax number(s)and Cell
phone.
3. Your bank name,address,bank Account Number and Telephone/fax
number(s). Contact me via my alternative e- mail:

 Bonjour,  Vous serez peut-être étonné de recevoir ce message cela est tout à fait normal mais permettez-moi de  me confier à vous. Je pense que vous êtes digne de la recommandation de ma prière, donc une personne honorable de confiance avec qui je peux faire des affaires. Ainsi je n'ai aucune hésitation à me fier à vous pour des affaires simples et sincères. Je suis Tiémoko Yoro Wahonon Françoise la fille unique de mes défunts parents M. et Mme Yoro Tiémoko Edmond Ivoirien d'origine Burkinabé. Mon père était un grand fermier et exploitant d'or à Abidjan la capitale économique de la Côte d’ Ivoire. Ma mère est morte quand j'étais toute petite et depuis lors mon père m'a pris en charge. Deux mois avant l'assassinat de mon père mort le 30 octobre 2006 sous mes yeux, il m'a secrètement appelé et m'a indiqué qu'il a déposé la somme de 5 millions d'Euro dans une compagnie de sécurité ici à Abidjan, Cet argent qui représente le fruit de ces années de travail devrait nous permettre de quitter le pays pour recommencer une vie loin de la politique de notre pays qui devenait dangereuse. Malheureusement mon père a été tué froidement par des hommes armés. Présentement j'ai du fuir ma maison pour éviter d'être aussi  victime de la barbarie de ces gens, je vous écris afin que vous puissiez m'aider a retirer cet argent de la compagnie de sécurité, et le sécuriser dans votre pays. Aussi j'aimerais que vous puissiez m'aider à vous rejoindre en vue de recommencer une nouvelle vie comme souhaitée par mon défunt père.Le colis a été enregistré comme bien de famille. La compagnie ne connaît donc pas le contenue du colis. Si vous êtes disposé à m'aider je vous ferais parvenir plus de précision afin que vous puissiez rentrer en contact avec la compagnie de sécurité. Ainsi dit, je suis disposée à vous offrir 15% de mon héritage en compensation pour votre effort après le retrait de ces fonds de la compagnie et son transfert dans votre compte bancaire. En outre, indiquez moi vos options pour m'aider sachant que pour moi, j’ai la foi que cette transaction peut se faire le plus vite possible. J’aimerais avoir votre point de vue sur cette question et cela selon votre disponibilité. Vous pouvez me joindre à mon adresse électronique: yoro_fanoise@yahoo.fr Merci, et que Dieu vous bénisse.

mr gat butu <gat_butu@virgilio.it>,,"Mon, 06 Mar 2006 09:40:11 +0100",FROM:MR GAT,"
Kindest Attention:

Dear Sir/Ma,
My name is Mr.Gat Butu I am from 
South African, I have been diagnosed
with Esophageal cancer. It has 
defiled all forms of medical treatment,
and right now I have only about 
a few months to live, according to
medical  experts. I have not 
particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone 
(not even myself)but my business. Though I am
very rich,  I was never 
generous, I was always hostile to people and
only focused on my 
business as that was the only thing I cared for.But now I
regret all 
this as I now know that there is more to life than just
wanting to have 
or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me
a 
second  chance to come to this world I would live my life a different
way from how I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have 
willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and 
extended family members as well as few
close friends .I want God to be 
merciful to me and accept my soul so, I
have decided to give alms to 
charity organizations, as I want this to
be one of the last good deeds 
I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed
money  to some charity 
organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and
Malaysia. Now that my health 
has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do
this myself anymore.

I  once 
asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and
distribute 
the money which I have there to charity organization in
Bulgaria and 
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves.
Hence, I do 
not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended
with  what I 
have left for them. The last of my money which no one
knows of is the 
huge cash deposit of Thirty Million United States
Dollars
($30,000,000,00) that I have with a Finance Vaulting Unit
Abroad. I 
will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it
to  
charity organizations.

N/B:
Kindly note that 35% of this funds must go 
to the tsunami victims,60%
to other Charity Organization and 5% for 
your effort and time.
I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my 
health situation, as I am
using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with 
you. You should respond
to (gat_butu111@myway.com) if you are 
interested in carrying out
this assignment on my behalf.
God be with 
you.

Mr. Gat  Butu.

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU-BURKINA FASO.
BANK WEBSITE:www.bkofafrica.net
PRIVATE TELEPHONE:00226-70-357-881

I am the manager of auditing and accounting  department of BANK OF AFRICA 
(B.O.A) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In my department we discovered an 
abandoned sum of US$20.5m dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand US 
dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. 
ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with his entire 
family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about the crash 
you can visit this site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that 
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this 
discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that 
the money can be  release to you as the next of kin or relation to the 
deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for 
it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed 
dormant fund.
The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after six years, the money will be transfered into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin 
in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a 
foreigner and a Burkinabe like me  can not stand as next of kin to a 
foreigner.
I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the 
provision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred 
during the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your 
country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to 
enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply 
first to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a 
text of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the 
text of application form,I will like you to send me the following 
informations.
1. NAME IN FULL:................................
2. ADDRESS:.......................................
3. NATIONALITY:...................................
4. AGE:.............................................
5. Sex..............................................
6. OCCUPATION:......................................
7. MARITAL STATUS:..................................
8. PRIAVTE PHONE NO............................................
9. PRIVATE FAX NO:.............................................
so i will like you to send to me those informations for easy and effective 
communication,also location where the money will be remitted.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application form.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free 
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required 
arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me 
immediately as soon as you receive this letter,if only you are intrested and 
ready to help.

Dear Friend,

I am Mr. T. smith , deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB 
Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business 
proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, 
(forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we 
discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his 
holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out 
that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin 
was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry 
Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, 
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 
US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for 
Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at 
the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of 
the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the 
owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes 
though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I 
tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because 
I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign 
account or have an account that is more than $1m.
I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company 
so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is 
simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so 
that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in 
place as the as the owner of the boxes.

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me 
and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this 
transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the 
successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address 
upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant 
documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this 
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like 
houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)
Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we 
can have a smooth communication.
Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )

Thanks and regards.

I am 28 years old and a graduate of Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria.  After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wave by the late director General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in August 27th last year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has Twenty Three Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars (USD23, 560,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Security vault company in London. He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father'properties, Companies e.g., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that traditionally; if he dies we cannot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistance and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of God, you will help us move this money out of London to any country of your choice where we can invest this money judiciously with you. You are entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.

J_KEMPWELCH01 <jkemp1968@yahoo.co.uk>,,,Transfer of Title Enquiry: Hsbc Bank,"
Dear Friend



I am Sir John Kempwelch one of the Director of HSBC Bank, London, United Kingdom. On the 2nd of January 2005, I received a call that one of my customer died in the Tsunami Disaster with his wife and only child while on vacation at Phuket Island in Thailand. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my customer's extended relatives and until date have not succeeded. 

   

I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client before it gets confiscated by our bank or declared unserviceable by our bank where this deposit is lodged. 



Now, the bank Directors has called a board meeting regarding this Fund. So my main motive right now is to share this great opportunity with you by presenting you as the Next of Kin to the Deceased since all his banking details are with me as his personal Account Officer. And the deceased Account valued at US$17.5M



Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the biological relatives of my late client, I hereby seek your consent to present you to the bank as next-of-kin of the deceased since you are a foreigner, so that the proceeds of this account valued at  US$17.5M can be transferred to you as inheritance and thereafter, you and I can share the money; 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% will be donated to the Tsunami Disaster Charity Fund. 

   

We shall start the first transfer with US$5,000.000.00 (Five Million United States Dollars only), upon the successful actualization of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account. I have the original copy of Certificate of Deposit of the funds, which will be used to substantiate our inheritance claims. All I require is your consent and honest co-operation to enable us see the deal through. 



Furthermore, I guarantee that the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please contact me if you are interested immediately via my personal email:jkpw1968@yahoo.co.uk to enable us commence on the transaction. 

  

Best regards, 

Sir John Kempwelch.

Mr.Eric Wong.
Union Bank Of China,
99 Queens Road Central
Hong Kong,

Dear Friend,

I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a 
desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of 
us. 

A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced your 
address, Please i apologise for this medium of contact as it appears 
the only definate way i can have assistance with this matter.

I am Mr Eric Wong, Head of Private Banking, Union Bank Of China,also 
account Manager to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who was based 
in 
the U.K. and had vast business interest in Hong Kong ,also referred to 
as my client.

On Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK , my client, his wife and 
their two Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for 
New York in their plan for a world cruise

I have been managing his  Bank accounts here in the Hong Kong, and some  
Properties which he had put out for sale. The properties which have 
long been put out on sale have been paid for, and the money paid has 
long 
been deposited into his local bank account here. I have contacted you 
to assist in repatriating the money and estate left behind by my client 
before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by my Bank. 
Particularly, the bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of 
his 
next of kin or have the account confiscated within a short period of 
time.My late client has an account is valued at 18 Million United 
States 
Dollars Only

I therefore made further investigation,with the personel department and 
discovered that did not declare any kin or relations in all his 
official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
This sum 
of US$18million is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being 
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. 
No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong

Richard Akueze <richardakueze@cosmo.com>,richardakueze@cosmo.com,,Joint Venture( urgent response needed),"FROM. The Desk OF: DR. RICHARD AKUEZE
DIRECTOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM 
CORPORATION (NNPC).


                  JOINT VENTURE

I strongly apologize for this unsolicited mail, but I
am constrained by circumstances surrounding my
profession .I have the mandate of my colleagues in
office to solicite for your  assistance for a deal we
want to execute

The business involves the remittance of
US$28.6M(Twenty eight million and six hundred thousand
United States Dollars) to your bank account from the
Central Bank of Nigeria. The money accrued through
deliberate over-invoicing of old projects executed for
the Government by some foreign firms. I and few
officials here have worked out a scheme to benefit us
along with any foreign partner who obliges us the
materials and channel to push out the fund, our idea
being to come over thereafter to share the fund with
whoever assist us.

To make things easy and legal, the fund is reflecting
in  our records as payable to a foreigner who did a
consultancy service job for the ministry during the
turn around  maintenance of one our petroleum
refinery.All necessary and relevant documents will be
procured for the release and transfer of the fund into
your nominated account

Please get in touch with me immediately through my
alternative email :richardakueze@sify.com.For your
participation in realizing this transaction 20% will
be for you,80% for me and other officials which will
be invested in your country.

I am awaiting your response most urgently and is rest
assured that this transaction is 100% risk free, as
there is no risk involved on both sides.Thank you and
God bless.

Yours sincerely,
Dr Richard Akueze
