This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday
to Lori!

One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got even
bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions came down
in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional Windows player is
MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my opinion. Sure, MusicMatch
is a decent player, but with plenty of great free players on the market, why
do we want to purchase a software player in addition to the $299+ hardware
unit?

At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true Windows
compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional functionality, besides
song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's XPlay remains a
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an iPod with
almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with contact management,
via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the iPod an additional drive on your
PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off
Apple's officially endorsed player.

Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's
SIC without a hitch. I just missed a face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of
winferno.com, although I'm sure we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the
free copy of Research-Desk for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival,
I enjoyed dinner with the eSellerate gang, with a discussion about GnomeTomes
and what the future holds.

Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately,
my Crosspaths.net connection allows me to send mail via my Lockergnome
account, unlike most of the national dialup services. Crosspaths is
technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of presence in almost every
major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, you may want to take a
look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori has used their DSL
service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of outstanding in
dealing with customer service queries.

**PNG Files Do Not Show Transparency in Internet Explorer (Q294714)**

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q294714

This originally appeared in last weeks Webmaster Weekly, but due to its
graphical nature, its worth inclusion here as well:

""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent
background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background may
appear to be gray rather than transparent."" Fortunately, Microsoft explains a
solution for this problem. Personally, I haven't encountered this PNG display
error, but for those of you simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to
review the solution.

**Fight Cloud**

http://www.fightcloud.com

Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of
selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price of
shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, so you're
getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail price tag. The
mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. The only thing I find odd
about this site is their proclamation of paying artists 50% of distribution
profits, which I have to assume is 50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The
artist selection contains some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

**Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?** (NR) 1966  
Adapted Play - 131min  
Reviewer's Tilt (10)

![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)

Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen
debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of
Virginia Woolf?"" Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards,
this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his
wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president. At first
George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-
adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love. George
and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty
cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs. Just as
quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology
professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy
Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic
exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise. Soon Nick and Honey find
themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.
Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely
choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead,
alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.
Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost
unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and
impeccable timing. At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with
Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how
about a little round of Get the Guests?"" This provides some idea of the
precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to
finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is
Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold. Ok,
I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not
have been much of a stretch. Both actors, however, deliver their lines with
the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying
slaying. Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax
or look away. Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is
not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a
memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

"""ContraComm International"" <istina007@yahoo.com>",List Member <ler@lerctr.org>,11 Sep 2002 08:33:28 -0000,SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica,"Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

No, no one has a problem quarantining someone who has say, Ebola, or malaria, because diseases do not require any decisive action -- just contact. fantasies, still require decisive action, even if its in conjunction with the way the fantasy works in the individual's brain. Many people have very strange and obscure fantasies (say wanting to be a model) that dont' require them to be locked up. Fantasies aren't nearly as much like plagues.   Not everyone in a given population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy, whereas everyone can get a given plague.   (BTW, gary, the whole concept of monitoring a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them getting a plague is silly.  I don't think plagues discriminate) You're trying to argue for a lock'em all up mentality, when I don't think anyone but you has even mentioned it.   His point was that fantaesies were a psychological? explanation for a possible event. Not that all people who have them, or even have a certain type, need to be locked up, quarantined, killed, rubbed-out or cleansed.

 Why would a customer use `spamassassin -t` without understanding what it does?

There's some place in the UK that sells loads of silent gear...
can't remember the name though... a google for ""silent pc"" or the

that you can't convert without an army of lawyers.

In other cases, you originally had owners who didn't have the 'right' to
subdivide, but they subdivide anyway.

It is interesting to note that for several centuries in Japan it was a
death sentence to sell land.  They sold it anyway, and kept records.

In the US, we eventually got quite friendly with squatters and adverse
possession, and integrated out extra-legal arrangements and 'spontaneous
social contracts' into the official law.

Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.

    ...the proper combination of commands to the electronically controlled

**IT sees new profits in Old Glory**  
Can CRM be tweaked to track terrorists? As the fight against **terrorism**
heats up, the government turns to the tech industry to come up with tools to
secure the country against attack. It's an opportunity for patriotism--and for
profits. (Nearly $38 billion is slated for homeland security.) **Software
companies** are sending tens of thousands of proposals to government agencies,
some of which are so new they don't have the budget to hire people to evaluate
them all.

**Are Spam blocklists going too far?**  
Many businesses are turning to spam-filtering tools to regain control of their
e-mail boxes. But legitimate e-mails are being deleted, too, now that
**sometimes-indiscriminate blacklists** have become a key weapon in the war
against unsolicited bulk e-mail. Companies subscribe to the lists, bouncing
any traffic directed to their servers that originates from those addresses. Is
**overkill** the answer to stopping spam? What is your company doing to stop
junk e-mail?

Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in
physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in
nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.
Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,
D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering
contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic
X-ray sources.''
Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other
half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the
University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant
underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from
the sun by the billion.
Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because
they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.
In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South
Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino
detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and
also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of
the brightest objects in the universe.
The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for
building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and
sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.
His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the
discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the
hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.
When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside
Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba
also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach
Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.
This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney
Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,
55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the
Karolinska Institute.
The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ
growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how
viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as
AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday
morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel later the same day.
The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish
Academy said on Tuesday.
The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -
will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.
The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are
not publicly revealed for 50 years.
Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.
In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to
those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and
``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field
of physics.''
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and
economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts
in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted
in strict secrecy.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in
1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

I don't think I could argue that ZODB is more reliable that BerkeleyDB.  It's true that we have fewer database experts and expend fewer resources working on database reliability.  On the other hand, Barry is nearly finished with a BerkeleyDB-based storage for ZODB. ZODB is an object persistence tool that uses a database behind it. You can use our FileStorage or you can use someone else's database, although BerkeleyDB is the best we can offer at the moment.  (It would be really cool to do a Postgres storage...)

Some of that frustration probably carries   SM>       over to ZODB, though it's almost certainly not ZODB's   SM>       problem. This sounds like a Zope complaint that doesn't have anything to do with ZODB, but maybe I misunderstand you.  You don't have to store your code in the database, although that will be mostly possible in ZODB4. Seriously, ZODB stores object pickles in a database.  The storage layer is free to manage those pickles however it likes.  FileStorage uses a single file.  Toby Dickenson's DirectoryStorage represents each pickle as a separate file.   SM> * It seems to grow without bound, else why do I need to pack my   SM>       Data.fs file every now and then? It grows without bound unless you pack it.  Why is that a problem?  BerkeleyDB log files grow without bound, too.  Databases require some tending.  One possibility with FileStorage is to add an explicit pack() call to update training operation.  We'd need to think carefully about the performance impact.   SM> Also, there is the issue of availability.  While it's just an   SM> extra install, its use requires more than the usual Python   SM> install.  Having it in the core distribution would provide   SM> stronger assurances that it runs wherever Python runs (e.g.,   SM> does it run on MacOS 8 or 9, both of which I believe Jack still   SM> supports with his Mac installer?). I think we'd want a spambayes installer that packaged up spambayes, python, and zodb.

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes 
is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some 
basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.

product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within

to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week;

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting

Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk

on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good

September 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 




 

Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. 

But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 

""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" 

Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" 

That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. 

Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. 

As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" 

Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. 

""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" 

Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" 

The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. 

How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" 

Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""


Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" 

At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. 

A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. 

Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" 

Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. 

Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. 

Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. 

""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" 

Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" 

""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" 

Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. 

But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. 

""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. 

Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 

""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""

The forums there are very informative, and there is also more info on
using linux on the mini ITX boards at http://linitx.org/.

A couple of the autopc projects make interesting reading in this regard:

Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the
situation.  There's good design and bad design. 
There's good testing and bad testing.  The problem
is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody
does.  I think ""best practices"" hasn't caught up
on main street Web enablement yet.  There's some
really great packages on how to do this stuff and
in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed
to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms
and  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and
people usually do.  What the problem is, they don't
even recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They just
keeping trundling along making a mess of everything
assured in their job security that they can build
Web forms without even caring if they can be
used or not beyond their test machine.

If you had a piece of software and a security warning
came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?
Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally
broken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know
is why would someone use Web forms best practices from
5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that
time.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows
or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window
manager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for
a brief period of time, but they are completely useless
except for some terminal based replacement applications. 

The bottom line is, if you can't get across the
bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault
it really is, and it's the business that 
needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that
wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

Date: Not supplied

I just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing.

_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" 

Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. 

MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. 

I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.

The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.

Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. 

Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.

By getting clear  on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be  moving toward and experiencing your highest and best. 1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will have even more to appreciate. 2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize  how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it.  EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly  imagine. 3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals. 4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and  drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more  calories. Eat only small amounts at one time. 5. Read something educational, inspirational or entertaining--preferably all three. 6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the Super-conscious. 7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy. 8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of  my book, then write in my journal. 9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful,  magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible. 10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments  (07/27/01)  ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~ yes   81% no    19% Comments: ~~~~~~~~~ No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many  people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks,  I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address  and about 90% of the time I can get the number.   We are so worried about putting our credit card number on the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and  they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do  who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person  tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy  of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that  person (me) would have her account info and could write  a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send  it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her  to tell me what the difference was between the original check  and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never  heard back from her.   The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is  available in many places.  Have a good day. --  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html ~~~~~~~~~ Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,  we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most  importantly, never give any personal information at a site  that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar  or a Veri secure sign or others.  Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put  in my credit information in each time instead of having  an account in standing, a little more time but less risks  involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet  mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is  deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web  to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier! --  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com  ~~~~~~~~~ Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that  my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner  was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.   My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address  went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees;  and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com  address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building  up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place  on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I  lost a minimum of $50,000.     I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first  time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often  enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet  theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals  and should spend years behind bars.   Customers are well protected from credit card theft;  however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by  purchase order and certified or registered company checks. --  Peter S.    http://www.GSSGeomatics.com ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED!

php's license is completely irrelevant to this.  think about it.
solaris releases their system which includes /bin/sh.  their license
is very restrictive and they retain the rights to their whole system.
but they don't own every shell script ever written by solaris admins

Date: Not supplied

The Distributed.net project -- a precursor to SETI@Home that used volunteer 
computer-time to attack giant, sophisticated ciphers -- has cracked RC564. I 
used to have half a dozen computers working on this. 

    On 14-Jul-2002, a relatively characterless PIII-450 in Tokyo returned the 
    winning key to the distributed.net keyservers. The key 0x63DE7DC154F4D039 
    produces the plaintext output: 

    The unknown message is: some things are better left unread 

    Unfortunately, due to breakage in scripts (dbaker's fault, naturally) on

CNET Software and Internet Services |   |  **Dear Readers,**  
So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier worms. If you
update your antivirus software on a regular basis, these new versions of
Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance. But if you haven't updated in a
while, these variants--plus the continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate
you. In security news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could
affect Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.

**Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password**  
An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with a password
is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm family. Frethem.k,
technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also called Frethem.l by some vendors,
uses its own SMTP engine to send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected
systems. This worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
are not affected.

**Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading**  
The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly screensaver, proving
that users worldwide are still opening attached files from total strangers.
Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a
successful variant of a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year.
Thankfully, this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.

**Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in**  
PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client,
inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail program open to attack.
Fortunately, there is a patch available.

For example, the simplest Chinese IM is Pinyin where you phonetically spell out each character using the pinyin romanisation rules.  For example, Zhong Guo (Chinese for China) is entered by typing 'zhong', then you're prompted with a list of possible matches, with the most common first in a numbered list, so you hit, say, 2 for the second in the list, then similarly for 'guo' 3. You can see, that, regarding keystroke counts, it's not that much different to English.  However, until you get familiar with the sorting order in the 'possible match' lists, it can be a little slow. Other input methods are more keystroke-efficient, losing the phonetic simplicity of Pinyin.  Chinese characters are almost always pronounced as a first-part-second-part, so zhong is 'zh'-'ong'.  One input method assigns single letters to the possible first and second parts, so 'i' might represent 'zh' as a first part and 'ong' as a second part, so you'd enter zhong as 'ii' and a digit to choose from the possible matches. I think the Microsoft Global IME has a 'stroke' mode where you can build up a character stroke by stroke, but you'd only use that when you know the character you want but you don't know how to pronounce it. >  >  some XIMs compose ""in place"", others do it on a special line, >  and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?). >  also, some(/most?)

Probably most often Ctrl-Space.  That's what the Microsoft Global Input Method Editor uses and what xcin uses IIRC. Regarding the original poster's question - here's what works for me on Red Hat 7.2 o  Make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_CN RPMs are installed.  (The    fonts might not be essential, I think XFree comes with usuable    Chinese fonts in the XFree86-fonts RPMs o  Select Chinese (Simplified) as the language in GDM when logging    in. Everything should 'just work'.  If you've got the default clock in your GNOME panel, you should now see it in Chinese.  A lot of the menus will also be in Chinese, but you should be able to find your way around. Use Ctrl-Space to toggle between Chinese and English input.  When  in Chinese mode Shift-Space toggles between something that I don't understand, but it blocks exiting to English.  So if you can't use Ctrl-Space to get back to English, try hitting Shift-Space, Ctrl-Space. Fire up a GNOME terminal.  In Chinese mode, type zhong 1 guo 1 and  you'll see the Chinese for China. Getting this to work while selecting English at the GDM screen is left as an exercise for the reader.  Looking at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/xinput and /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info.

Except that parroting the party line doesn't really require much
freedom of speech. Now if you had posted something from a left of
center source, you would have been shouted down in flames, buried in 
ad hominem attacks, and probably get your name added to an FBI list. 

 
Besides the basic rule in the United States now is ""I'll defend your
rights to say anything you want, but if it isn't appropriately
neoconish, well, don't expect to work"":


HHS Seeks Science Advice to Match Bush Views

By Rick Weiss
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, September 17, 2002; Page A01

The Bush administration has begun a broad restructuring of the
scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

I've terminated a number of my own mailing lists at yahoogroups many
months ago because of similiar sentiments. I've tried lobbying other
people to move, but with about zero success.

Lesson learned?  NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.     Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.     I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.

What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
distruption of peacable political assembly has become
a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the
word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one
I posted.

Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and
I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.
Let me summarize the important parts of my post for you: I
have a premise that there is a difference between free and protected
speech and action.  I think O'Neill on his soapbox doesn't
understand the distinction.

All better?

A quick Google search turns up:

Darwin streaming media server

http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/index.php
MPEG4IP: Open Source, Open Standards, Open Streaming

MPEG4IP provides an end-to-end system to explore MPEG-4 multimedia. The
package includes many existing open source packages and the ""glue"" to
integrate them together. This is a tool for streaming video and audio that
is standards-oriented and free from proprietary protocols and extensions.

Provided are an MPEG-4 AAC audio encoder, an MP3 encoder, two MPEG-4 video
encoders, an MP4 file creator and hinter, an IETF standards-based streaming
server, and an MPEG-4 player that can both stream and playback from local
file.

Our development is focused on the Linux platform, and has been ported to
Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, BSD/OS and Mac OS X, but it should be relatively
straight-forward to use on other platforms. Many of the included packages
are multi-platform already.


Both sound interesting, and low $$.

You seem not to know what a ""poor man's divorce"" is.
It is an old term, from the time when divorce was
difficult, but walking was easy, and identity was
not so locked down as it is today. Not every widow
had a dead husband.

>I'm seeing lack of innovation ..

That doesn't tell us anything except what is
happening in Eugen Leitl's life. The more common
observation is that the rate of change is increasing.
Do you have any data that might persuade us that what
you see is more telling than what others see?

>gerontocracy favors gerontocracy.

I would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotech
research and plenty of young workers to pay taxes.
Note that the fertility rate doesn't result from
decisions made by the old, but by the young. If we
want more kids, we have to convince people who are
in their twenties to become parents.

>From the registered phone line, you can call to any phone in the contiguous 48 States. You speed dial an access #, then you simply dial the number you wish to reach. That's it, how easy can it get?

* What are the limits?

The service is only for Voice communication, FAX or data transmissions are not supported. This is for normal residential or small business use. The only thing we ask is that you register your line correctly. If you register as a residence and it is determined that the service has been used as a business we cannot continue to offer you the service.

What's the price?

The price of the service is determined by the available access number. With a local access number the residential service is $43.00. If we only offer toll free (800) access in your area then residential service is $63.00. No hidden fees, just one low monthly rate billed to your credit card or drafted from your bank account.

If you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.   score RAZOR_CHECK 10 The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5. Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5 would be sufficient. If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient. Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA won't do it and avoid the double network hit. However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam. But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold. Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as Razor1.

Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier currently : 1. Leave your current kernel as-is 2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm 3. Rebuild and install resulting packages Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem, NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm. Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-) Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

Date: Not supplied

Neil ""Sandman"" Gaiman has won his lawsuit against Todd ""Spawn"" McFarlane, 
vindicated in his assertion that McFarlane breached his contracts, stole his 
characters, and used his name. 

    McFarlane looked down somberly as the verdict was read. As the judge polled 
    the individual jury members, he looked at their faces.

But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies.  And, BTW, England as well. Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons.  First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper.  Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement. (In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.  It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.) OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling.  Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU. =========================== The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money.  The effects are a complete disaster.  There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid. So almost all the literature talks about that. But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation.  The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board. I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect.  And Canada is still a prosperous country. > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Gary > Lawrence Murphy > Sent: Saturday, September 21, 2002 7:31 AM > To: Mr. FoRK > Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: Re: sed /s/United States/Roman Empire/g >  > >>>>> ""f"" == fork list  writes: >  >     f> ""Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift >     f> whole societies out of poverty"" I'm not a >     f> socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear >     f> examples? >  > China?

Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London

James Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

>1. Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.
>
A)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past? 
 Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.
B) ""How it is currently being expressed"" amounts to a tacit 
acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and 
people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive 
expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less 
sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke 
the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of 
society.
C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also 
aren't 'found in the wild'.

(By ""primitive expression"", I don't mean to slight any society, but that 
there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized 
behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). 
 The US has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 
40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious 
conflict, were settled quite a while ago.)

D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or 
less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated 
by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article 
pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical 
integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, 
government, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage 
of British conquest, but who doesn't?)

(I couldn't find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A33761-2001Jul8&notFound=true
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true

'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and 
cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and 
religiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, 
and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part 
of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or 
nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.


In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But 
violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling 
the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both 
sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by 
far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united 
Ireland

The provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were 
killed during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern 
Ireland understatement, as ""The Troubles.""'

>2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.
>
That's fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration.  It would be 
difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way.  I'd be 
happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there.

DVDs don't use trusted hardware. As for whether it is worth it, that 
depends entirely on what its worth to secure your software.

my local ISP works great with my iMac. I don't know what you guys 
have over there, but OS X ought to let you get online as well as 
anything else.

Crossing my fingers though....I did a upgrade to Jaguar, and ended up 
doing a scrape and install after that.

No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:

	# mount -o remount,rw /usr

This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.

Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
apologies.)

Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and
did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).

However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby:

http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html

whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea.  You
could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and
mount the fat32 partition.

Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the
maptop far more useful in the long run.

1. romaji, or european languages which
tend to end in vowels, would presumably
work better with attention on the ending
syllable (or at least consonant sound)

2. are typos a larger or smaller space?
I had a whoromatic proggy that scattered
transpositions at hazard where the hands
alternated quickly; that would be a much
smaller space -- but transposing/eliding
spaces might make for a much larger one.",0,0

my exmh-2.5 suddenly will not spell-check anymore. If I click More..., Spell...
a window opens and is gone just as fast.

I don't recall having tinkered with anything.

How can I get spell-checking back?

If you explain please do it so a standard PC user will understand.

The onboard DVMT card has an Intel 845 G/GL chipset.
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/linux/ or
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/intel845g/linux.htm has more specific

I also found somewhere (not through personal experience though) that

The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant 
points in its favor, it still manages to suck, and break across JVMs.

I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like 
java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU 
compiler collection.   But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere 
because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are 
probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.   When I looked at 
what I had to do to gcc and link ""hello world,"" I lost interest.

Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway?   Why are Perl/Python/Ruby 
more reliable?   In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code 
utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single 
portable JVM that just works.

My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze 
browser java implementations.

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure

Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>","Digital Bearer Settlement List <dbs@philodox.com>, fork@spamassassin.taint.org","Mon, 23 Sep 2002 10:36:39 -0400",High-Altitude Rambos,"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23HERB.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top  The New York Times September 23, 2002 High-Altitude Rambos By BOB HERBERT Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks. Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar. Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza. They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down. One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot. The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane. ""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout."" Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot. There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell. This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong. Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released. Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department. The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too closely."" If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail. Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed."" Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention. ""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security."" --  ----------------- R. A.

Hello Nicety, I  have to agree with Jim Shofstall, http://www.wonderpaint.com,   when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441:  One major problem is that many programs don't release memory  when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the  approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems,  I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much  negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer  for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's  favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I  have to make it do anything useful.  If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE  download called FreeMem which you can get here; http://www.meikel.com This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you  also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released.  This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be  running at peak performance all the time and much easier than  constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these  little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to  search for. HTH.

Comments on Site #141:  http://www.floridarental.co.uk Carol Hall carol@floridarental.co.uk ~~~~ Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to make your front page navigation a little less confusing? The ""next page"" tab is right next to one that says ""bookmark this page"" - no information until you mouseover the tab to tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not enough information on your openning page. ~~~~ I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL ending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site. 1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the animation and red text on the yellow background, missing the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more details to this important introduction. Instead of using the 'click here' button, just have a text link following directly after the introduction. 2. On the second page, have all your links the same color, and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially when it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill. 3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed menu and the pages are all untitled. I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you want the best site you can have and I think these changes will make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the site you have the information organized and complete. I even wanted to come and stay! ~~~~ The animations make this site look amateurish from the beginning.  The flashing ""Bookmark This Site"" makes me want to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans MS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve this site. ~~~~ I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should have been up by the text and that is where I should go. On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that, the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page. The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good. Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten that far. ~~~~ This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich. Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste, but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that form a background for some images. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________ Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
with riot gear and pepper spray.

We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
arrested. Not very muddied at all.

Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java, please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of October). There will be a technical and writing test, and interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with others. This should be a great learning experience and a fun time. =================================== * Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent The second revision will be up on the site soon, at: http://64.78.49.204/ The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs). The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done yet. We have made more progress in the testing system. Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the beginning of the book. The book is due at the end of October. The print version will appear in December. =================================== * Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrow Available at: http://64.78.49.204/ Chapters 1-4 are finished =================================== * Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.

But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively?  >From the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's earnings. United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal , a Information-Communication Technology Policy Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18. infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to draw participants from local, national and international organizations from both the public and private sector. This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors, users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source, e-Government and related fields. Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York. ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy. But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world, so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles. See http://www.egovos.org/ OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N. ====================== Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source tools.  Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal.  It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft. UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin  of the Information Society Division also announced that this international organisation has been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science and culture. It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising, updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for including new basic documents.  ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"" said Dauphin.  Check out the sites at UNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/) UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/) UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/) UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/) NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS ====================== Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS.  CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code (GPL license).  See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml Meanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme) based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and related issues. ""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid Akhtar told this correspondent. Niranjan Rajani , of Pakistani origin but based in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on ""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"". This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net. This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects; GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies and lives of these countries. CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS ====================== In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source.  Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's the message that governments across India were recently with, as official computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence. Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way. Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in varsities, military installations and within government.  Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the government sector. On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the news. GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed out. (See http://www.lincproject.org) ""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater .  While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet.  Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet in low-income communities, access is still an issue.  Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their homes.  LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints. ""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95< according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center. LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar projects but had limited success,"" says Slater.  LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led organizations that LINC serves.  ""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC explains. LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office. Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local support. ""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more effectively,"" said Slater. To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC Project Linux pages at  NEED TO NETWORK =============== Bala Pillai , who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World. Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche.  ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it. Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to more symbiosis with them,"" says he.  Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community. ""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he.  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai.

Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea. Jeebesh Bagchi  sent in this offer recently. It could surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources.  It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely  workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like ours. --FN ========== Forwarded message ========== The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi (www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the area of Free Software, Open Source Software and Social Usage of Software Sarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to propose projects in the area of free and open source software applications relevant to educational, social and community needs.

Zimbabwe eases GM stance

Zimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grain
so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency.
The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said
Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in
the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.
Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute
ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.
But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of
checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system.
There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative
export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are
GM-free.
Aid
Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
""The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in
accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other
countries in the region,"" Mr Morris told journalists.
""It will enable us to do our job,"" he said.
Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern
Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the
region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.
The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes
of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.
The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's
campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has
worsened the situation, say many donors.
Lost markets
The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.
Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling
it as 'poison' .
Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be
planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.
United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that
Americans eat GM maize every day.
The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption
and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages 
from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote 
it up. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Discuss[3] (_

As a pointer occupies the natural word size (32 bits or 64bits), no wonder you get 4*1024 (sizeof(char *) * numer_of_elements). >  int len = sizeof(testbuff); >  cout << len << ""\n""; >  return 0; > } > using "" int len = sizeof((char*)testbuff); "" sizeof returns the size of types. You can use it with vars (and then the normal form is sizeof var, not sizeof(var)), but if you're changing the type with the var with a cast, of course you'll get the size of that new type.

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

for the Los Angeles Times.

Taking a look at the S&P 500, and 
using the Ibbotson 2000 figures of
13% expected stock return and 20%
standard deviation, and taking the
the actual 2.5 year return on the
S&P since 31 Dec 1999 to be close
to -30%, we find:

-.30 ? 2.5*(.13) - 3*sqrt(2.5)*(.20)
-30% > -60%

so it still plots out between the
control lines ...

> So long as the points fall between the control lines, no adjustments

... but maybe we should've checked
the process during the ""long"" bull.

America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the right time, to go that high. Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is involved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example. Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models. Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school. Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the rest of us who tend to sort. There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the first place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous. And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity of heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition. Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far more animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.

Hi,

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
specially with regards to false-positives.

cheers,
vipul.

In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?

With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).

Despite all evidence to the contrary, they've definitely got some reasons.     When you go to a conference which is very high-energy,  with a lot of paradigmatic reassessment going on, where  ideas are being flung around bodily well outside the box,  well, that's an impressive thing.  But it's my principle  as a sometime working journalist  not to get all carried  away whenever I witness something like that.  They might  well be drinking their own bathwater.  This sort of thing  generally requires a reality check from some *other*  conference.     So, I'm now fresh back from Colorado, from the yearly  meeting of the High Ground Design Conversation.  These are  my best pals in the industrial design world, some dear,  long-time friends of mine, whose judgment I always trust.   And why would a science fiction writer trust the judgment  of industrial designers?  Well, because they're very  *trendy.*  They're very shrewd,  and very stylish, and very  hands-on people.  They're  peculiarly self-effacing and modest, yet quite  imaginative.  Better yet, they're even practical.   So they're kind of like science fiction writers, only with  much better shoes.     Usually when I go to this High Ground event, I just  deliver some wacko chat about popular aspects of  cyberculture and then I take some worshipful notes.  But!   I have to report that when I took them my notes from the  ""CRA Grand Challenges in Computation"" conference, I was  bringing the noise.     This is the first time I have ever seen their jaws  drop.  They're still kinda wringing their hands over the  dotcom boom and the Ka-boom. They miss those glory days of  the World Wide Web == because for them, that was the  Graphic Designers Full Employment Act.  So they're pretty  broke, and they're a little shell-shocked, so I guess they  should join the club.  But  when I brought them *this*  stuff == a rather extensively worked-out vision in  worldbuilding from the point of view of ubiquitous  computation in the 21st century...  Well, of course this  is merely a scenario, but to me, ""911.net"" smells like the  future.      And frankly, it doesn't smell good.  But that's all  right.  Because these aren't good times.  These are rather  harsh, dark times, and in its own peculiar way, 911.net is  a similarly harsh, dark concept.     ""Ubiquitous computation"" is by no means a new idea.    The guy who invented the term is dead, and even his R&D  lab doesn't look all that great these days.  Ubicomp has  been around for quite some time == in the table-napkin,  handwaving stage.  But it's lacked the means, motive and  opportunity to get any real-world traction.    I believe that may be changing.  If so, it's mostly due  to the events of September 11.  After that experience,  ubicomp has got motive and opportunity as it never had  before.  And the means, although they are still  speculative, are starting to make some sense.     What am I talking about when I use the term ""ubicomp""?   Well, the term is a grab-bag, a congelation of different  technologies.  Some are here, commercially available off  the shelf; some are in the lab; and some may be physically  impossible.     Let's get down to some brass virtual tacks.  What are  the key technical drivers for widely distributed, self- organizing networks of sensors, processors and actuators,  embedded in the physical world?  And what do you do with  these things?     Okay, number one:  fuel cells.  Not chemical  batteries.  Small, portable, dependable, long-lasting,  power sources with some punch.  They may not be fuel cells  as they are now known.  They might be MEMS fuel cells, or  aluminum-air cells, or something enzymatic, I don't care;  just something much, much better than today's batteries.   Portable power is the crux.  Ubicomp's  future, if it has one, entirely hinges on this.  If we don't get some seriously  advanced,  portable sources of power then everything I am  about to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm. (Not that there's  anything wrong with that!)     Number two, RFID.  Radio-Frequency ID == gotta have  some taggers.  Gotta be on the Net.  It'd be nice if they  had some powered processors in them.  Something internal,  pervasive, a little computational action that is going on  inside physical objects.     Number three, wireless broadband.  Getting real close  here.    Number four, dongles.  I think this part is seriously  underappreciated.  This is the weird part of ubicomp, the  part that may turn out to be its Achilles heel:  some way  to turn the damn thing off.  And to *know* it's off.  The  problem of the authorized user.  The authorized  administrator, the authorized access.  This is likely to  play out as ubicomp's functional equivalent of the  Internet's intellectual-property problem.  In other words,  it's a very serious issue which is going to be neglected  from the get-go, as people are eagerly building the basic  infrastructure.  Then, as they lamely try to build it in  later, they are going to find out that they have  inadvertently poisoned the water-stream for everybody.     You don't want to wander into a Kazaa and Napster  version of George Orwell.  Ubiquitous computation, unlike  information, does not ""want to be free.""  This is not a  technology of freedom. Ubiquitous computation wants to  make you its slave. Try to remember that, for all our  sakes, all right?  This is not a water-cooler for gossip,  like the Internet is.  This is a hard-case, hard-times,  hands-on, rather ruthless command-and-control system.     Number five, GPS, global positioning systems.  Been  there, done that.     Number six, convoy traffic.  I think this is also  underestimated, for when I started looking at serious  applications for ubicomp, time and again, rapidly shipping  large amounts of physical material in and out of the  ubicomp zone is a killer application.  Getting stuff in,  numbering it, assembling it, moving it out. Lots of it.  Train loads, truck loads, bus loads. And airlifts.     Bringing up the van, a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff,  of varying degrees of use and practicality.  High speed  fiber optic networks, check.  Massive storage and routers,  check.  Big databases, check, but they need to be fast and  flexible. Some ""MobiHoc"" action: mobile ad-hoc self- assembling networks: networks that are always  reconfiguring in real-time, always on the move.       Facial recognition has a considerable number of  ubicomp applications, by no means all of them good.  Human  presence-sensing systems?  Oh yes.  Ruggedized hardware  suitable for outdoor deployment in all conditions and  weathers.  Real-time simulation of ongoing major  situations.  Toxin detectors of various kinds,  environmental monitoring of almost every sort, biometric  ID...  I have a long list of these.  I'm cross-checking  them.  I'm using them to build scenarios.     One thing about 911.net makes it very distinct from  earlier visions of ubicomp.  This is not Microsoft Windows  for Housekeeping.  This is a hard, tough web that you  throw down fast over dire emergencies.  The key concept  here is that we are finally moving computation out of the  ivory tower, for good and all.  No more glass boxes of the  1950s, no more clean abstractions of cyberspace.  We are  deploying computation at unheard-of speed, into the  darkest, dirtiest, most dangerous places in the world.     It is a resilient security apparatus for emergencies.  That is 911.net.       Now, you might well argue that ubicomp is very  invasive of privacy.  That's just what my industrial  design pals said about it, immediately, and they were  right.  It's been hard to find reasonable deployments for  ubicomp in peacetime commerce and in private homes,  because it is so Orwellian. However.  Under certain  circumstances, other social circumstances do trump this  issue.     For instance, when you are breathing your last under a  pile of earthquake rubble, you don't really care much  about privacy under your circumstances.  What you really  want is  a smart bulldozer, a tourniquet, and some direct  pressure against your open wounds.  And that is what  911.net is about == or will be about, should it find its  way out of the computer-science talking-shop and into  daylight.        It is an emergency response system for the planet's  open wounds.  And those wounds exist in plenty.  There are  more of them all the time.     I rather doubt that the Orwellian version of ubicomp  has much of a future.  That's a scenario that I have  dubbed ""Terrorspace"", which is ubicomp in the context of  airports and nuclear power sites.  If you've been in  airports recently, I believe you are seeing a pretty apt,  early version of Terrorspace.  At any random moment, you  can have your possessions rifled through by strangers.   Your shoes are scanned, and various small but vital  objects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi- educated security geeks.  They're either pathetically  under-trained for the job (in which case you certainly  feel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable  people (in which case you pity them and wish they had some  other job, for the sake of general human happiness and the  GNP).  Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace  airports serve as political indoctrination centers that  humiliate our voting population on a broad scale. They are  meant to inure us to ever-escalating levels of  governmental clumsiness and general harm.     The difficulty with this Terrorspace approach is that  airports and airlines are going broke.  Airports are  hemorrhaging money trying to maintain this terrorspace  apparatus.  It is likely to spread to the brittle power of  nuclear power plants, nuclear waste dumps, bio-sites,  chemical sites, liquid petroleum gas centers and so forth.  That will hugely increase the overhead of all these  dangerous industries.      That's a very considerable tax burden.  So, though  Terrorspace may serve as a full employment program for the  loyal and slightly stupid, that's not going to pay off  socially or economically in the long run.    However, 911.net is a different matter.   An air- deployable 911.net that allowed first responders to  rapidly deal with fires, floods and other major disasters  would *save* money, especially for the insurers, who are  already on the ropes.     The actual September 11 event, 9/11, was a rare and  remarkable thing.  And, with fewer than 3,000 people dead,  it's just not that big a deal as genuine catastrophes go.   Politically, theologically and militarily it was huge, but  a workaday 911.net wouldn't fret much about terrorism.   Instead, it would have to deal mostly with floods, fires,  climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes and (let's hope  never) asteroids and weapons of mass destruction.    So, basically, with 911.net, we are describing a social  re-definition of computer geeks as firemen.  Native  twenty-first century computer geeks as muscular, with-it,  first-responder types.  I think this would be pretty good  for the computer industry.  We all need to take the  dysfunctional physical world far more seriously.  This  week, Italy's flooding, Texas is flooding, Colorado's on  fire.  This morning, the brand-new wilderness forests  around the site of the former Chernobyl are on fire,  spewing radioactive ash hither and yon.   Chunks of  Antarctica the size of Rhode Island have fallen into the  sea. I could go on.     This is the sort of activity that humanity is required  to deal with in this new century. If we build a successful  method with which to do this, those useful tactics will  spread across the fabric of our civilization.  I believe  they are already spreading.  An innovation like 911.net  will likely serve as a camel's nose in the tent for a  whole series of ubicomp applications across society.     I've been speculating about these new forms of  ubicomp, and giving them some flashy neologisms, because  that is what science fiction writers bring to the table.   We build little scenario worlds and make up names for  them.  First we've got ""911.net,"" then ""Terrorspace,"" but  there are others. BATTLESPACE.  A term already much-used by the Pentagon.   Battlespace means military C4ISR. The ""Revolution in  Military Affairs.""  I would point out that the military,  unlike some sectors, is not reneging on their enthusiastic  commitment to the digital revolution.  On the contrary.  I  haven't seen anybody in the military saying that they long  to go back to the good-old-fashioned, solid, easy-to- understand methods of the War in Vietnam.  The military  are very into ""network-centric warfare,"" and they couldn't  be happier about their spysats and surveillance drones. PROSTHETIC UBICOMP.  This is eldercare.  A huge, steadily  growing market. Alzheimer's disease is a flat-out domestic  catastrophe that lasts seven years.  Any computational  help here == in elder-proofing spaces, tracking the sick  and so forth == would be of huge benefit to society. CRADLE.NET.  Babies have no privacy.  Children have little  privacy. Child-proofing a room against a crawling tot...  if you've ever done this, you can realize how much use it  might be to have this process automated.  Any two-year-old  always wonders:  ""Why can't Mr Fork and Miss Wall Socket  be friends?""  A real-time checklist, at the very least!   And then we're faced with the interesting, large-scale  prospects of ""K-12.net."" STREET.NET.  This would be traffic management and urban  systems management.  Water networks, power networks, subways, sidewalks and so forth. PUNISH.NET.  Two million people are in the American prison  population.  They've got no privacy.  They've gotta be  watched all the time.  They're basically crammed in iron  cages now. INDUSTRIAL UBICOMP. Managing supply chains, industrial  assembly and so forth.  This will eventually be the  biggest application. SO/HO UBICOMP.  Ubicomp in the home, the home office and  small office.  Some very interesting consumer uses here,  but in the grand scheme of things, not that big a deal. SAFETYSPACE.  These would be military bases, U.N. safety  zones, refugee camps, and disaster evacuation centers.   It's fairly easy to imagine ubiquitous computation as a  sinister ""gated community"" that walls off privileged areas  under threat.  But we can also think of it as importing  some human comfort, solidarity, mercy and safety into  various benighted areas that are severely disturbed.  One  can imagine a Gorazde UN safe zone version of this, new  and improved of course: a black helicopter ghosts over in  the dead of night, deploys a scattering of small drones,  smart-mines and sensors, and suddenly the war just stops  within these bounds of Safetyspace.  Rapine, looting,  sacking, smashing and burning are  ruled out of existence  through computer awareness.  The handiness of a technique  like that for life in the 21st century... well, it might  be a bit underestimated. And last, coming up with a bullet should the good times  return in all their carefree glory:  UBITOPIA.  This I  take to be ubicomp as an Urban Entertainment Destination.   You go there for fun just because there is cool, wacky  stuff embedded in the physical world, and it's behaving in  a way that brings joy and hilarity and good spirits, like  the funhouse mirror at a digital carnival.       When and if Ubitopia really hits, it will mean that  humanity's basic relationship with our material goods has  been radically redefined.  That is the apotheosis of  ubiquitous computation. Just: material goods, and the way  we deal with them, are different.  Different in character,  different in quality.  Not recognizable by 20th century  standards.      So. I have no idea if the Homeland Security  department, or FEMA or DARPA or the NSF, are going to pony  up any money for any of these notions.  That's not my  lookout.  I'm a science fiction writer.  And ladies and  gentlemen, with this material, I have struck platinum.   This stuff is really hot.  This is a great, attractive,  contemporary idea that is really new, really different,  and really ominous.  The implications are huge and they  spread across the board of society. I am going to be a  very busy guy with this material.  If you want to help me,  send some email. Thanks a lot for your attention.

me!

Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.

>>From the spamc man page:

       -u username
           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
           then you can still use this flag.


The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
spamc. From the procmailrc man page:

       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient.


I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

|
|
| Hi All,
|
| I am running SpamAssassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent
| with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
| /etc/procmailrc.
|
| spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with
| any flags.
|
| When I was testing the program, I deployed spamc from my personal
| ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
| I can see this because I have a non-default ""required_hits"" value which
| gets reported in every e-mail on the ""X-Spam-Status"" line.
|
| Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
| ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
| e-mails from outside computers.  The ""required_hits"" value gets set back
| to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
| e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
|
| Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or
| procmail bug?
|
| Thanks,
|

So either you can choose to have a ""docs"" directory inside %{_docdir} by putting : %doc docs (or, totally equivalent, the latter just reminding it's a directory) %doc docs/ Or you can put all files that are in docs/ directly in %{_docdir} : %doc docs/* Try both, poke around, and you should catch the difference if it's not already clear for you. You can also mark any file from the %{buildroot} as documentation (will be listed when using ""-qd"" to query the package's docs) by using %doc with absolute filenames, for example : %doc %{_datadir}/foo-game/manual (this is /usr/share/foo-game/manual, an absolute file) Also, for the packager's convenience, all files in /usr/share/man (aka %{_mandir}) are automatically tagged as %doc. > Also one more thing, whats the best way to work out the dependencies? > as for example with gnuboy, all hte docs and the website says is it > needs SDL. >  > Do I set a Requires: SDL >= 1.2 (as my system uses SDL-1.2.4-5) or just > put Requires: SDL. Build the package once and see if it checks for a specific version, or read the installation notes. Often you'll see ""checking for SDL >= 1.2.0"" for example when running configure, then it's best to also make the package depend on that version. > One more quick question, I'm used to compiling source code no problem > (cannot program, but stumble through), whats the best way for finding > out what RPMS are needed for the Requires & BuildRequires macros? > apart from read all the docs and websites info. Well, read the docs indeed :-) You can also compile the package once without those fields and see what the configure script is checking for (basically, the libs and versions you'll need to add to the BuildRequires:) then once the package is built, query the automatic dependencies that rpm put into it. You'll see for instance if the binaries/libs from the package need SDL, gtk+  etc. Then add those ""Requires:"" and rebuild a final version of the package. Often you can omit some dependencies, for example if a program is checking for glib, gtk+, gdk-pixbuf and gnome libraries when being compiled, BuildRequires: gnome-libs-devel Requires: gnome-libs will be enough since they already depend on the ""lower level"" libs that are glib, gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf. > Once again sorry to bother you with this, but I figured you were the > best one to ask.

Secure and at ease
ByJack Mccarthy
August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PT

MAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
company for a king's ransom.

Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.

A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
company.

""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin 
says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""

Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
fortune.

""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so 
it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
The trade-off is fundamental.""

Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
more than 3 million business accounts.

Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.

Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are 
areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""

Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.

""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20

PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.

""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" 
Litan says.

To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program 
that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The 
work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
arrived.""",0,1

John Gay <johngay@eircom.net>,ilug@linux.ie,"Sun, 21 Jul 2002 19:06:06 +0100",[ILUG] Optimising for PentiumMMX?,"I've been playing with an old Dell OptiPlex5110 and decided to attempt to 
build a PentiumMMX optimised Linux on it.

To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for  compiling programs.

Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to 
the kernel code.

Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of 
matrixes and can also benifit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build, 
I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, 
so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.

Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage 
of the MMX processor.

Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even 
more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or 
do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian 
compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?

I am wondering if the C, and other libraries  should be re-built? Can they 
take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? 
And would this require re-building gcc as well?

I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I 
would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the 
kernel, X and KDE should improve performance.

On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking 
for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX 
M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another 
I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the 
SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing 
two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch 
the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not 
had much luck.

Cheers,

	John Gay

blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way
you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share
pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that
are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that

I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 Mac OS X Tips is in publication and
available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have
appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means
getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've written
that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, I'll be
ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will find them
useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things on the list
has improved my personal OS X experience.

Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing sections
of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the contributions of the
other two guys. This does not mean either of them is truly less involved, it
just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and Randy regularly send me
links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which will ultimately end up in
upcoming issues. Since the writing will be primarily mine, I've opted to
eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom of each article. Unless
otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. If you need to send me an
e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the sidebar will reach me, as well as
putting your message in front of Chris and Randy.

I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months and
believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going to add
a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what your level
of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with some really
basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting topics. Either
way, I'm open to some AppleScript suggestions.

See You in August,

**Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE**

http://www.searchstandard.com/

While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning off
some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the preferences
will speed things up considerably, particularly for local machine searches.
This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on search capabilities to the
bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of SearchStandard.com. This bundled
collection of search plug-ins makes it possible to look for almost anything
using Sherlock. Their Web site won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free
plugins most certainly make finding things online, including searches on your
favorite Mac sites, that much easier.

**Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48**

http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html

Dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like intranet
access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those services failing from
time to time. Don't be left in the dark when one of your services go down, let
Xnet keep you informed. The unregistered version of the product lets you
verify http, ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service
verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your local machine,
verifying remote service availability and sending you a message when those
services go down. The interface allows for user-defined services, with alert
features for both an e-mail account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone)
and locally via a sound from your machine.

  

 GnomeTERMINAL

For OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you need to
change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly useful in
situations where one user created a file, but an entirely different user is
the only one who will ever make future decisions relating to that file, like
whether to keep it or throw it in the Trash. chown is the Terminal command
designed to handle this. From the command line type:

sudo chown username filename

You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for
username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will replace
filename.

As we move further into the future of Apple's Mac OS evolution, it remains
important to understand where things evolved from. Susan Kare designed all the
original icons for the Mac OS, way back in 1983\. In fact, that smiling Mac
that appears as OS X boots is her creation. Check out her collection of UI
artwork, from both Windows and Mac operating systems. Also available from
Kare.com are Kare designed icon apparel and collections of fonts as designed
by Susan.

Show Info gives you access to change the application associated with a
particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of the best
features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" related to a file or
application. This can be a great place to store information on recently made
changes to a file, information from others who've looked at a file, or in the
case of applications, serial numbers and other pertinent data you may need
when dealing with tech support.

Limbo seems to be able to compile its own kernel with its own gcc 3.1. 
That said, I don't want to know what kind of patches Redhat are applying 
to that kernel. The .spec file alone is 128KBytes! One of the patches is 
2.4.19-ac10. Redhat don't seem to have patched Limbo's gcc too heavily.

Ebargains <ebargains@reply.mb00.net>,cypherpunks@einstein.ssz.com,"Tue, 23 Jul 2002 14:34:01 EDT",Michael asked me to send this to you.,"| Hi,  
  
Want to increase your chances of winning a big jackpot in those Internet
contests?  
  
Michael Khalili, the famous programmer who you may have read about in USA
Today and other newspapers, came up with a method that makes it **_hundreds of
times easier to win online._**  
  
He recently wrote a program that will AUTOMATICALLY enter you in online
contests--over and over UNTIL YOU WIN (or tell it to stop). We at Grab.com are
so excited by this system that we're putting it online for our members to use.  
  
  
THE PRIZE IS YOURS - GUARANTEED!  
  
If you win a contest using this program, the prize is legally yours to keep--
GUARANTEED! Our lawyers assured us that Michael's program is legal, and online
contest sponsors have CONFIRMED that it doesn't violate their rules. **_So if
you win a prize, you'll receive it. If you don't receive it, we'll pay you
ourselves. GUARANTEED._**  
  
  
FREE TO USE.  
  
Best of all, this service is free to use. All you pay for is related network
expenses--which only cost $1 for 7 days of the service. That's dozens of
entries for what you'd usually pay to get a single lottery ticket!  
  
As a member in good standing of this mailing, **_we've already set up the
automatic entry system for you._** All that's left is for you to turn it on.
Once you do, you can sit back and watch it enter you into contest after
contest after contest after contest....  
  
  
Click here to begin!  
  
P.S. This system will continue to enter you into hundreds of free contests
until you win (or cancel it).  
  
P.P.S. All the prizes you win are yours to keep--GUARANTEED!

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him

Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'

Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
bees.
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.""
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

if used properly, they actually can make code more readable.  but those

While I am in Linux, the following message is the output when I
execute fdisk /mbr, even though the drive is in read and write mode:

Unable to open /mbr

The mbr is on a separate drive -- not related to the Linux drive.

It is the first time testis tissue from such distant species has produced mature sperm when grafted in mice. ""It might work for primates or even humans,"" claims Ina Dobrinski of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the co-authors of the study.  If so, the technique could be used to preserve the reproductive potential of male cancer patients about to undergo therapies that would destroy their ability to make sperm. Men often freeze sperm samples before receiving chemotherapy, but young boys cannot do this because they do not produce mature sperm. If it works in humans, the technique would allow testis tissue grafted from boys to mature and produce sperm. Infectious particles  The mouse grafting technique also has an advantage over another option for preserving fertility - testicular transplants. These involve re-implanting preserved germ cells into the testes after cancer remission.  But the grafting approach ""would eliminate any possibility of passing cancer cells back to the patient,"" says reproductive biologist Michael Griswold from Washington State University. However, it is possible that the grafting procedure could introduce mouse-derived infectious particles into human embryos, making some scientists wary of the idea. ""I would very much hesitate to say that it's something we should be doing,"" says reproductive biologist Roger Gosden of the East Virginia Medical School. Castrated mice  In the study, Dobrinski and colleagues placed small pieces of testis tissue from newborn goats or pigs just under the skin on the backs of castrated mice. Two to four weeks later, they found that more than half of the 477 grafts had survived and were producing normal-looking goat or pig sperm. When they injected the graft-derived sperm directly into eggs they saw clear signs of fertilisation, indicating that the sperm function normally. The researchers also found that the procedure worked just as well with testis tissue that had been refrigerated for two days or frozen for several weeks. Gosden has tried transplanting human testes tissue into mice, but was not successful. However, Dobrinski believes the technique could soon be used to preserve the germ lines of endangered species, including rare animals that usually die in captivity before reaching sexual maturity. ""We think that's a very real application,"" she says. She adds that mice with human testis tissue grafts would also be useful to scientists who want to test the effects of toxic substances and new contraceptives on human sperm production.

I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people speak from
personal and professional experience. Draw your own conclusions. Lockergnomie
Sang Vo writes: ""Though you may have zero liability for a fraudulent
transaction, the paperwork and red tape to work through if someone empties out
all your funds can leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards
that now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact your
credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a plan added to your
card or if you can apply for one that does."" And Russ Coover continues: ""If
you purchase something with a credit card, and you later decide to dispute the
purchase (for a reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses
to replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can legally
dispute the charge with your credit card company. However, if you use a debit
card to make that purchase, you have no right to dispute the charge.""

Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in question (E):
""In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if you give your financial
institution timely notice of the theft of your card or PIN code (two business
days), you are liable for no more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up
to $500."" And Tim Miller extends the translation: ""If someone puts a false
charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your liability for $50,
with the possibility that your next charge might not go through because the
thief used all of your available balance. If a false charge goes against your
debit card and wipes out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can
bounce. Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25 insufficient fund
fees - and they are under no obligation to waive those fees. If you have 5
checks outstanding, you could be out over $100.""

Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: ""Someone recently obtained my debit card
number through a local grocery store. I was told by the checker at the grocery
store that the card readers would only accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was
very suspicious, and used my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's
computer had been hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was reviewing my
checking account online two days later, and noticed an unauthorized charge
against my account ($60.00). I contacted the vendor that had charged my
account and informed them of the fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the
shipment, provided the shipping address to my bank, and credited my account
within 5 days after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact that I had to
request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive.""

Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: ""I'm not totally sure on
this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for online purchases.
Yes, you may not be liable for any of the false charges on a debit card (in
the end), but in the meantime (during your dispute) the money will be withheld
from your account and you will not have access to it. However with a credit
card, you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The scenario I
was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your debit card and cleaned
out your checking account? The money is gone! False charges on a credit card
are not ""real money"" until somebody has to pay them. I would guess that each
bank has different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
mine and see what I'd face."" In short, be careful - no matter what you use or
where you choose to use your plastic.

See You in August,

**To Share or Not to Share**  
Scribbled by Lee Smith

I think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is being
shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I do not believe in
it. I can't consider it stealing because you can't steal from someone who
willingly puts the file up for downloading. Those who did put the file online
most likely feel that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are attempting to
make their CDs ""rip proof"" either. I do not feel they have the right to
dictate what songs I can listen to or when or in what order. I like to rip
specific songs from CDs then make my own CD, which either goes down to my
entertainment system or to my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played
(""why"" is explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for my
truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs stolen, it would
be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a master. Sometimes, masters
cannot be replaced without a large expense, if at all.

If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not available
anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song being sought is wanted
to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I do believe in that, too. Case in
point: as a kid, I collected a lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than
4,000 records in my collection. Many were played so much that they are not
playable anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to relive some
of my younger days through music, but attempting to convert those records (to
digital) is next to impossible for me. So, in this instance, no, I do not
think it is illegal to seek out digitalized copies of the old songs that I
already have records of (albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I
am seeking are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
from Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.

For those that are impossible to find ""digitals"" for, then, one day, perhaps I
will reach a point with technology (and money) where I can transfer those
platters to WAV and they will sound as good as when they were originally
recorded. I have been lucky enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet;
I was quick to purchase the disc, usually from the original artists
themselves. Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem to care
about the ""lost"" songs when digitally remastered CDs are released.

Who can save you from making a small oversight with your digital video camera
purchase? Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: ""I see that you're thinking of getting a
DV camera. I got one about a month ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get
one with A/V INPUTS. Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your
digital stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to get
VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only can you get your
old 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can use the camera as a pass-
through device and get the old stuff directly onto your computer for editing
purposes. I wish someone had made clear the advantages and importance of
inputs when I bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But if you're
going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you want to work on any of
your old stuff). Don't make the same mistake I did - make SURE you get this
feature. It doesn't seem to impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and
some don't."" This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
helping us, Frank!

footwear was outcast from the group weeks ago, and has been very depressed

apologies for the possible silly question (i don't think it is, but), 
but is Eircom's aDSL service NAT'ed?

and what implications would that have for VoIP? I know there are 
difficulties with VoIP or connecting to clients connected to a NAT'ed 
network from the internet wild (i.e. machines with static, real IPs)

any help pointers would be helpful,

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 11 Sep 2002 20:22:18 -0400 (EDT)",Since we were on the subject...,"Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and
thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.

The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed
last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh
come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it
ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story
lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the
enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to
have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.

But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would
rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign
on the old killsawfiles.

SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say
that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,
thier ""manager""*, for  pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too
long and just when things look to be heating up with that story
arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces
that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the
Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie
McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first
lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.

Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this
around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier
way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be
edited much though from the way I heard it.

So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play
acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a
face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,
thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat
and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some
heat time would be good for him as a single.

All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4
year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on
borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no
longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?

Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz
and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.

* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.
Ricco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy

Hi, First of all, sorry for not replying to your private email from last week, but I really don't have a slight idea of what could be causing this! - Is this with different DVDs or a single one? - Is this using OSS or ALSA? Have you tried both? - Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones? I remember a user having trouble with a particular DVD ever since upgrading libdvdcss to a recent version, but haven't heard the end of the story.

**Rhapsody rules**  
I never thought Id say it, but Im changing my tune about subscription music
services.

When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late
last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software
was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I
wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of
file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.coms Rhapsody, a
subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure
recordings from all five major labels. And now Im rethinking my stance.

Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download
them to a portable player, youll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD
burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge,
and you cant download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and
lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons
of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something
with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that
has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download
MP3s? Let me know at edit@download.com

**Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who
should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser:**

_""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest
possible usage by their target audience""_

A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.

_""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So
it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""_

After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this
response makes the best argument.

_""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to
only one browser.""_

Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall
into the Web user category.

_""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no
matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""_

Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while
noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.

_""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is
understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the
remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""_

A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost
efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share
browser.

Without addressing the overpopulation argument, the more bureaucracy,
the more opportunity for corruption. If a corporation is corrupt,
there are generally, absent more government intervention,
alternatives. With bureacracy that is more difficult; one generally
most uproot oneself and move.

Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.

Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.

D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""

Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.

The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.

Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.

""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""",0,0

I think it would be best if there would be general provisions for foreign language rules. In the spirit of the ok_languages option; let users easily enable or disable rules in certain languages. Like a foreign_rules option which could be used to control which foreign rulesets are active. Usually people would want to use checks in all languages which are in the ok_languages list.

The likelyhood of EFF or other mailing lists getting filtered will
decrease over time as these mails are revoked whenever they get filtered
out. Revocations help the system to punish reporters who report legit bulk
mail such that their future reports are automatically considered suspect.
As such, with all the new changes to TeS, the likelyhood of filtering
mailing list posts has decreased dramatically. Please keep me posted if
you see false positives on the EFF newsletter again.

 Thu 22 Aug 2002 

 Meaningful sentences 
 
 Tracey Lawson 
 
 
 If you ever wanted to look like ""one of the most dangerous inmates in prison
 history"", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson -
 the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and
 fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary
 muscle power. 
 
 Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,
 has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he
 has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a
 day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at
 virtually no cost. 
 
 The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a
 fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and
 starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the
 exercise industry. 
 
 ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the
 opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""Its a joke and a big con and they call
 me a criminal!"" You cant help feeling he has a point. 
 
 This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having
 already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems
 created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to
 discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. 
 
 Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents
 when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to
 help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to
 express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the
 murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he
 has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was
 published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an
 award-winning film. 
 
 Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in
 Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison
 officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being
 transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and
 developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,
 a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received
 critical praise. 
 
 And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books
 that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book
 deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported 10 million, and is no doubt
 scribbling away as we speak. 
 
 So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so
 destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck
 on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books
 about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both
 pragmatic and profound. 
 
 He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have
 known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the
 chance to focus on their creative skills. 
 
 ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an
 education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time
 anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" 
 
 However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:
 ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine
 the very essence of who they are. 
 
 ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or
 am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something
 good?"" 
 
 Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that
 of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered
 mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed
 robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term
 over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was
 jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly
 two days during a jail siege. 
 
 Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is
 renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands
 and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit
 a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" 
 
 But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary
 Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every
 coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which
 so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because
 Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. 
 
 ""All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of
 bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be
 described as a refreshingly honest style. ""We can all be fat lazy bastards,
 its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff
 your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me."" 
 
 As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside
 we all needed. 
 
 
 Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will
 be available in bookstores from October at 7.99

Strange... all my openssh packages don't explicitly requires a version of openssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hat package? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve your problem. What you need to know for openssl is : 0.9.5b is libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.0 0.9.6  is libcrypto.so.1 and libssl.so.1 0.9.6b is libcrypto.so.2 and libssl.so.2 Now in all Red Hat packages I've seen so far, the only dependency is on those files and not on ""openssl = version"".

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
spammers.

Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:

http://belps.freewebsites.com/

I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm

Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.

I think my mail wasn't very clear ;-) My point was that we should continue 
releasing new rules and removing broken ones (all based on discussions on 
this list of course) in the 2.4 branch instead of creating a new 2.5 branch 
everytime we have a bunch of new rules.

A new branch should be openend only if (big) new features are introduced 
(eg. Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules 
are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But 
currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in 
his setup (like -F going away). So if we say ""the branches are stable to 
the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out 
when you update to a new minor version number"", users and sysadmins could 
be less reluctant to update.

All just IMHO :o)
Malte

P.S.: I'll be away from my box and my mail account for one week, starting

**Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMac**  
NEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's
switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio
players and a new flat-panel iMac. Jobs used his keynote speech at the
Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such
as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of
free iTools. The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players
include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows
operating system.

**Scient files for Chapter 11**  
Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed
to sell certain assets to a professional services firm. The deal calls for
Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up
to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.
Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the
company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. The company and SBI
said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that
financing ""will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients
without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.""

**Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouth**  
What does Yahoo Mail have against mocha? That's what users of the company's
free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the
word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes
to ""espresso."" To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated
filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code
known as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web
enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the
recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as
telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change
a password, for example.

Unisys, a specialist in high-end servers, is coming out with a new lower-cost
line of Intel-based servers as it gears up to promote the Itanium 2 chip.
Unisys' new Aries servers accommodate as many as 16 Itanium 2 or Xeon
processors and cost between $75,000 and $300,000, said Mark Fevertson, Unisys'
vice president of server marketing. It joins the Orion line, which can use up
to 32 Xeon or Itanium 2 processors and has been on sale for about two years at
a cost between $140,000 and $700,000.

Microsoft plans on Wednesday to announce a rebate for those who buy the

Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and
upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version
of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable
software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X
and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or

**New chip may portend ATI comeback**  
ATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week
with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms
of performance. The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the
details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new
architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images,
according to sources. The fastest versions of the new chips will offer
considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving
ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after
Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--
comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two
will remain close.

Rick Moen <rick@linuxmafia.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Mon, 12 Aug 2002 13:46:03 -0700",Re: [ILUG] SUSE 8 disks? (thread changed slightly),"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):

> I'm confused. I thought it was GPL'ed and that the money you paid SuSE

Yes, you're confused.

A Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots
of separate codebases.  Some are under the GNU GPL.  Many are not.  Are
you clear on this point, now?  This is my second try.  One suspects that
you actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it.

You're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to
get covered software for free.  It does not.  It provides that _if_
you've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have
rights to also receive the matching source code.

> I don't particularly need support, so I'm not really interested in
> purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use.

Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way
you can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay
the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not ""lend"" or duplicate) 
you his copy.

> Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so
> I'll just ask him.

Ask him _what_?  If you're asking him to ""lend"" or duplicate his CDs,
then you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally.

Don't like SuSE's product licensing?  Write your own distribution.  You
can even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_.  All you have to do is 
heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces.

What, you think that's too much work?  Then, try a different
distribution.  Clue:  _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set.  Even RH
7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on
the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among
others.  (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other
hand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether 
open source or not.)

&check now un-defangs MIME -- it was screwing up some of my mass-check

joelonsoftware <rssfeeds@spamassassin.taint.org>,yyyy@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 09 Oct 2002 08:00:39 -0000",Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four,"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html
Date: Not supplied

Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. 

*""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. 

Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 

[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] 

The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. 

In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 

And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. 

I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. 

*""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  

Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. 

*""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 

- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""


*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

Thanks Tom and Jacob. The above works, but without the double quotes: i.e. 

sh -c 'for f in `folders -recurse -fast` ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'

I'd attach this command to the sorting menu if I knew any tcl...

Indeed.

The ftp'able tree (e.g., 8.0 for i386) contains to my knowledge only
items whose licences allow public redistribution, even where they aren't
open source.  The retail boxed sets (Personal Edition, Professional
Edition, and Enterprise Edition) _add_ a number of additional
proprietary apps that are very much _not_ freely redistributable.
I made a list, a while back:

Freely redistributable proprietary apps in SuSE
----------------------------------------------
UofW pine/pico/pilot
John Bradley's xv graphics tool
T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars's xforms/xformsd graphics toolkit
(some others)  

NON-freely redistributable apps (in boxed sets):
-----------------------------------------------
Siemens AG's DB4Web middleware
Poet Software Corp. FastObjects SDK for Java and C++
IBM Java 2
Intel-v92ham winmodem driver
MainConcept GmbH's MainActor video-editing package
www.mimer.com's MimerSQL
MGE UPS Systems's Personal Solution Pac (MGE power management software)
Real Networks's RealPlayer
Adobe Acrobat Reader
Software AG's ADABAS D
H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH's AntiVir V
Knox Sofware Comm.'s Arkeia
Datan's dataplore digital-signal analysis package
Enterprise Solution Server (ESS) ERP system
Sun Microsystems Java2
Borland Kylix Open Edition
Moneydance
OpenEIS enterprise information system
Opera Software's Opera browser
Heisch Automatisierungstechnik's rk512 serial interface to Simatic S5 /
    S7 plcs
SAP database
Sun Microsystems Star Office
VMware, Inc's VMware
http://www.vshop.org/'s vshop e-commerce software for MySQL
  

All of the latter category either are available only via retail sale, or
are available lawfully on the public Internet only from authorised
distribution sites or on CDs from authorised distributors.  The exact
terms differ.

For example, you can download Borland Kylix Open Edition from
borland.com, free of charge -- but you'll notice there's no mention of
any right to redistribute.  That right is reserved by default to the
copyright owners, and Borland doesn't include it in the Kylix
proprietary licence.

clever. A bit more robust is:
#first param is number of
#times to repeat second param
#
#e.g. quote=`repeat 3 '> '`
repeat() {
     seq -s , $1 | sed ""s[0-9]\{1,\}[,]*$2g""
}

btw loops in bash are shit slow! see:

I don't think this is possible.

My impression is that a pre-collected corpus would not fit most individuals
very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus.

One problem that comes upp immediately: individuals are lazy.

If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to
press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy
to press the 'spam' button instead.  However, if in addition
have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look
much less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setup
the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.

The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete
action, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems
with this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around
without deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of
habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,
I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.

I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.

The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,
and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one
in the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we
need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see
how similar they are.  Any ideas ?

Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.
If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),
false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite
to remove the spam smell.

In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much
smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be
slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from
the ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.

Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,
there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,
and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,
that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.

It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from
the spam corpus, in case of user ooops.

I agree.  In a way, I signed up just by buying steaks from them.  However, once
I tell them to stop, everything after that is spam.  I told them to stop *many*
times.

It's a pity, too, since they have great steaks.  Buying from them is just not
worth having to put up with all of that clinginess.

So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using the string representation instead of the pickle, right? Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it is.  Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every value of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a ton of redundancy.

universe. too big to decrypt.

my point is there will never be a ""safe"" key. what I would consider is how
long does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for
longer than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to
stop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what
is available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not
release the data to the public.

I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking
the key gives away it's secret.

the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP
for example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the
nightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we
needed to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the
XP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.

the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my
computer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me
return them and get my money back.

the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.

Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like
/home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

real-time'... Groove really has people running scared. Wonder if any users
actually /benefit/ from collaborating in real-time.

http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/INW20021004S0001

Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.

Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.

Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.

Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.

With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.

Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.

For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.",0,1

Well, I'm hardly a Gaeilgir, but in general I wouldn't consider
either ability or inability in a language something to be proud
of... maybe it's just me, but I'm not proud that I can't speak
Italian, no more than I'm proud that I can speak French or

Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
""like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London.""

Was ""like a frog in Cheapside"" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?

And to what event or events does it refer?

I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch
Phrases.*

Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my laptop's CDROM takes 700MB at a time (obviously) and compressing media files is dumb because they are already compressed. Dumb question: how to backup huge data? Network backup to another box? I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box with a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a space computer with a large HD with much free space). These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! Yes I learned that used CDs make inexpensive backup copy on the shelf.

Which means the sender has a list of who the true
targets are, and who the fake targets are, and
scripts for mixing these. On the receiving side,
my email client distinguishes between messages
that are read, and messages that are not. I like
to mark or save messages that are particularly
interresting or important to me. And even if I
make a point to delete ""suspicious material""
immediately upon reading it, even THAT might
leave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.

Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that spam
protects people who want to distribute or see
material the government disapproves.

One such discrete satellite remains FILEZILLA, the           still-necessary ftp gui client for Windows. Those who know           it won't need the introduction, although they might           appreciate the note that it's getting close to v2.0 time.           For dogged WS_FTP users, though, it's got multiple           downloads, auto-restart of interrupted 'loads, queuing, and           sftp and Kerberos support. It's also GPL'd which makes it a           nice bit of source for anyone wanting to grok Win32           networking from something that works.           http://filezilla.sf.net/   - talking of trademarks, will the Godzilla people strike before MS?                                 >> MEMEPOOL <<                 ceci n'est pas une http://www.gagpipe.com/          (Not safe for work) next year's RED NOSE DAY looks more fun           than usual: http://www.threepillows.com/tour2.htm ...

_InDigiNet Identifies Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35
Million..._



**Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate**

The Wall Street Bulletin believes that the recent investment of capital into
Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, is further proof of the continued validity of
the telecommunication market when looked at from the perspective of the small
to mid-sized enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future
may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to
remain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. ""Every major
industry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar
transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the
mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert
Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.
Christopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all the people
that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving
carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few
millions."" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the
link at the end of this newsletter._

As we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)
has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As
InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this
company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.
This could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our
Highest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.



**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**

We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.
A similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),
share price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over
$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously
had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267
million.

IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for
potential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a
few months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an
increase of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time
is right for investors to get in on the ground floor.



**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**

InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-
sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet
is a prestigious ""Diamond"" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for
Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to
offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building
a communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer
bases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its
acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then
expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance
profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data
services and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and
this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten
years. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.

**The __ IT Market**

Based on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag
significantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including
Internet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT
spending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7
percent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market
researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.
In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in
the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436
billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect
growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will
experience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market
will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,
India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_



**Particulars**

The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth
recommendation list for the following reasons:

1\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,
single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the
acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution
channel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,
wireless, and data.

  
2\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range
communities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the
value of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing
campus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic
Committee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.

  
3\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to
acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and
smaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the
targeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to
purchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.



**Investment Consideration**

InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,
2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1
2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for
their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and
more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to
small to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars.

Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to
be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit
_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter
as much in the embedded world.

And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec
[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.

Definately still very very true. C++ compilers are still a rarity.

Remember that the GA is going to be considering combinatorial 
uses of the rules, so rules which look dodgy on their own might 
be gems for the GA -- perhaps something with a S/O ratio of .5 
actually occurs often in combination with some other rule, and 
in those situations, helps to distinguish spam vs nonspam.

Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used

Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

Having recently checked out both of these, for a selection of
books, the exact same basket of books cost more in both .de and
.fr (taking delivery charges, VAT et al into account) than buying
the same thing in amazon.co.uk

The books I used to check were 
1) C unleashed (Heathfield et al)
2) Design Patterns (Gamma et al)
3) Computer Graphics, principles and practice (Foley et al)

I was hugely surprised that amazon.co.uk worked out cheapest - by
a considerable margin, too - something like 12 euros after
freight was taken into account.

Cheers,
Dave.

Forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job. I tracked them
down, they dont exist anymore, like 99% of the things I track down the req's
are pulled or there is a freeze.

The real problem is you cant even train for jobs now, since they _demand_
7-10 years at a job paid to do the wierd collection of skills they want.

But I'll get lucky eventually and someone I know will be a hiring manager.

After thirty?three years of being a black man living in ""Ghetto America,"" an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the ""Black Generation X"". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of ""Generation X"". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed ""Baby Boomers"", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled ""Generation X"", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: 
 
 ""We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called ""Xer's"" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.""
""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong."" 

This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these ""similarities"" speak primarily to only ""white"" issues and concerns. For instance, ""they"" say ""we"" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America ""we"" could only depend on one our mothers! ""They"" also say, "" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,"" and "" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever."" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all ""we"" have time for. 
I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the ""Black"" from ""Generation X"" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.
There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. ""White America"" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled ""Ethnic Notions."" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching ""Roger & Me,"" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex
 posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.
Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.
 Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. 
What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with ""Huxtable?like"" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or ""working class"" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the ""Huxtable?like"" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. 
The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our ""dirty laundry"". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. 
I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. 
The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that ""black male and female generation X"" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)
Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.
In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. 
Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our ""male rapper"" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. ""The Big Tymers"", a popular rap duo, have a song called ""I'm Still Fly"", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (""Fly"" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:

""I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci
Suit, can't pay my rent cause all my money's
spent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.""

Worse yet, in the song ""Grinding"", the popular duo ""Eclipse"" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term ""grinding"" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are ""grindingyou know what I keep in the lining"" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and

""Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up
and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup""

In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term ""cake"" or sometimes ""pie"") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. 
The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al
 luded too. 
I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of ""us"" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. 
Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being ""African?Americans"", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as ""Black"", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as ""Niggas,"" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with ""Nigger"". The term ""nigga"" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term ""My Nigga"") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as ""Ghetto"", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the
  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. 
My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.
In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by ""White America"". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno
 wledging that this absence is by design. 
There are other ""core"" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not ""thugged out"". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the ""thug,"" and ""drug dealer"" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. 
These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that ""confused mentality"" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American ""ghetto"" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ""ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into ""Black America"".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that ""backward thinking"" is the main 
 cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.

The 130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies. But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk. Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only came into service a few weeks ago. It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who launched it in July. Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table. At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were baffled by the problem. The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby. One Airbus worker said: ""We couldn't work it out. Then the penny dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It caused great amusement."" The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about 200.

Alas, that's wrong. Both the drives are faster (10..15 krpm vs. ~7 krpm,

None of them are production quality. Right now only ext2 and ext3 qualify.

Have you looked inside a dual-CPU 1U Dell? Three drives are easy to get 
in. Anything else would require a redesign, and would in nontrivial

I can't think of a single major vendor who sells 1U systems with hardware
EIDE RAID.

I believe you that stuff can be found, if one is looking for it. However,

Good to hear it's not just me.  Mind telling me how you set PERL5LIB
specificly? I've tried a few things (setenv in the shell, as well as
$PERL5LIB == ...inside the Makefile.PL, even on the perl command

Yes, but doing it an order of magnitude or 2 easier does :) Which with the

 I'd prefer to use an ISP that didn't tolerate spammers myself.

 The only way Spam lists work is because ISP's customers find they can't
send mail to many domains, and ask the ISP to do something about it.

Background The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of its filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  NFS is built on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. II.  Problem Description A part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC messages had an error which, when the server received a message with a zero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the previous message, creating a loop in the message chain.  This would later cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server code which tried to traverse the chain. III. Impact Certain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages in some cases.  A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up when such clients connect. An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD system can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause the target system to lock up. IV.  Workaround 1) Disable the NFS server: set the nfs_server_enable variable to ""NO""    in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot.    Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the    showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes    should suffice. 2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from    untrusted hosts. V.   Solution The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 systems. a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility. # fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch # fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch.asc b) Apply the patch. # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch c) Recompile your kernel and modules as described in  and reboot the system.

<mikej@aol.com>,<webmaster@efi.ie>,"Mon, 09 Sep 2002 17:45:22 -0000","Earn $139,000 a year as a DAY TRADER!","It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

Better yet, start another list; fork-spam and forward the suspect items to it.
Much like the noarchive list.  This wouldn't be perfect but it'd be better than

I apologise for wasting your time.

I follow this list from home, and thus use
a yahoo account. I haven't been able to find
a threading mechanism for this, plus the
fact that the list can start to fill up
my inbox after about a week of no pruning.

This is the reason for my initial grumbling. I 
would like to be able to follow what's going
on without clogging up my yahoo account.


Anyway, I should have initiated a new thread for my
different request about S.u.S.E. CDs. I won't repeat
my error!


Again, my humble apologies.

Reader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience:

""You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you might want to point
out to other Gnomies that they could practice their Karaoke on my Red Hot
Karaoke Page site. There are the words and music for more than 1100 songs
available on the site and by downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is
provided) they can even change the key of the song to suit their voice range
as well as speed up or slow down the music to their taste. In other words, to
have the same experience as they would have with professional Karaoke
equipment but at no extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to
Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly prepared for your
Karaoke.""

Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to help out a former
co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server and networking stuff. The tough
part is remembering everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always,
always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks in advance and
I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a handprint on my forehead when I come
to the realization that I left something important behind. What will it be
this time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.

See You in August,

**Forwarding to Internet Address Fails**

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636

Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all internal and Internet
email to his AOL mailbox when he's out of the office, and I figure it's going
to be a piece of cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along
with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was the driving force
behind this request. What I found was that Internet email proved to be easy
using a simple forwarding rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was
being sent out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to be
included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a default configuration
option on the Exchange 5.5 server that prevents automatic replies/forwards
from being sent to the Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A
quick configuration change and restart of IMS will put things right.

**Windows XP System File Checker**

Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a possible solution to my
Windows Media Player problem under Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it
prior to attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no improvement. It's
still worth a mention, however, in case you're not familiar with what it's
there for. As you're probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that
will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or altered in any
way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable state. Sometimes this system can get
a little out of whack, and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any
hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left in place since they
properly update the DLL Cache that is used as the sanity check to determine if
a system file has been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command
prompt and type ""SFC"" to display a list of options.

**Consider This**  
Forwarded by JW

http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html

The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected representatives, you
might want to start asking about their opinions on technology laws that are
being proposed left and right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing
brain death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz Hollings
and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman gets his way, companies
may very well be allowed to hack into your systems without proof of
provocation in order to ensure that you are using their software according to
the stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or upset other
systems, there isn't thing one you can do in return. Nope, they'll have legal
protection. This garbage is seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be
abused, consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly pointed out
eBook security problems with Adobe's software and was promptly thrown in jail
for his trouble under the authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He
was eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more right.

"""Gordon Mohr"" <gojomo@usa.net>",<fork@spamassassin.taint.org>,"Fri, 9 Aug 2002 15:18:47 -0700",Re: David Friedman: Mail Me the Money!,"My ideal mailwall will allow message passthrough in many ways:

  - Sender membership on my personal whitelist or any one of 
    many other external whitelists I respect
  - Payment of a small fee (via a website and PayPal link)
  - Demonstration of special per-message effort, either 
    via...
    - a computational challenge (hashcash)
    or
    - other challenge that requires human-level flexibility & 
      followthrough (sender manual whitelisting)
  - Inclusion of a legally-enforceable guarantee that the
    mail is not an unsolicited commercial pitch -- one
    example of this class of guarantee would be a posted
    bond
  - By convincing some analysis software agent of mine that
    I want to see the mail, based on its content and 
    distribution list

There's no need to do only one. Some might overlap; the manual
process for passing a message through might require the assertion
of a legally-enforceable guarantee about the messages' contents.
Passing certain tests once might add an address to the persistent
whitelist.

Any slightly determined and legitimate correspondent would be
able to find multiple ways to get their mail read, while spammers
would face a situation where the marginal cost of reaching me
is much, much greater than the expected return. 

Some economically irrational spammers (and religious/political 
zealots) would get through, but such traffic should be a 
background trickle rather than an annoying torrent.

Driver who hit moose fights county over meat

By GISELLE GOODMAN, Portland Press Herald Writer
------------------------------------------------------------------------
via http://www.lorencoleman.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTON  In her freezer at home, Lisa Pierce has ground beef and roasts,
frozen vegetables and french fries, even a couple of Popsicles. What she
doesn't have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on
Nov. 5, the moose that was rightfully hers, but instead went to a neighbor.

The lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the York County Sheriff's
Department to get back what she says she is owed.

""I think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor,"" said Pierce. ""I'm a
woman and he just neglected to think that I would want it. The moose is
gone, I know that now. I want to be compensated for the meat.""

Whether or not that happens is uncertain. Her experience, though, highlights
a law some Mainers may not be aware of, but should get to know during this
peak time of deer-versus-car accidents, as the animals, in their mating
season, come out of the woods.

The law is simple: A big-game carcass caught by a car - be it a moose, deer
or bear - goes to the person who hits it, as long as a law enforcement
officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident.

It comes up quite often in Maine, say officials. Last year, there were 4,055
cases of vehicles and deer colliding on Maine roads and 600 accidents
involving moose, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Warden
Service.

""In a state of what, 1.4 million, with only 215,000 licensed hunters, I
don't know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a
moose,"" said Latti. ""You do have the option of keeping it.""

Which, for some people, can be valuable compensation for a damaged car.
Farm-grown deer meat can retail for $8 to $20 per pound in stores. And a
butchered or dressed moose, which can't be bought or sold anywhere in Maine,
can produce hundreds of pounds of food.

Latti said when it comes to moose, the law has been abused since its
inception in 1991. Every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a
driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car. That kind of ""hunting""
makes no sense to Latti.

Hitting a moose, even at a slow speed, is no laughing matter. Large adult
moose can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and can be more than 9 feet tall. Since
the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars, their bodies
often come crashing through windshields in collisions. More often than not,
crashes like these damage the vehicle, the people inside and the animal.

Sometimes they are fatal. In 1998, Latti said, there were six moose-related
fatalities. After that, when the number of moose-hunting permits went from
2,000 to 3,000, there were less. Maine had three moose-related fatalities in
2000, one in 2001 and two this year so far, said Stephen McCausland,
spokesman for the Maine Public Safety Department.

Pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car
did not become part of that statistic early on Election Day. But she also
feels cheated by the whole situation. After all, her car was totaled.

On the morning of the accident, Pierce was taking her two children and a
neighbor's son to school in her 1991 Dodge Dynasty. She said she was going
along at about 35 mph on a well-traveled road, when a moose came out of
nowhere.

""By the time my brain could see moose, he was part of my windshield,"" she
said. 

Pierce is well aware of the law, so as she sat in the ambulance with the
children, being treated for cuts and bruises, she thought about the moose.
But the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal
with it, so she said she wasn't able to follow up on the animal until later
that day.

When she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave the
fully-racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor.

Her neighbor, she said, subsequently offered her the moose for the $100 it
took him to carry it away, money she didn't think she should spend. By the
time she contacted the Attorney General's Office on Nov. 12 to complain
about the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor's price had gone up
another $300 for the cost of butchering 450 pounds of meat.

And when she called York County Chief Deputy Maurice Ouellette to complain
that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer's
fault that she didn't have it, Ouellette told her he could not give her cash
and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in York
County.

""At that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore, but
wanting money,"" Ouellette said.

That conversation, and a similar one she had with York County Sheriff Phil
Cote, left Pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the
moose.

But the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to
other officials.

""It's the officer's discretion,"" said Latti. ""And if the officer feels the
person can't immediately remove (the animal), he's got to think of public
safety and other people on the roadway. If someone is worried about her
children in her car, the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask
is if she wants the moose.""

Maine State Police Trooper Jeremy Forbes said when he arrives at accidents
that involve a serious injury to a person, the issue of who gets the animal,
deer or moose, becomes secondary.

""The priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital,"" he
said. ""If they are really hurt and going to the hospital, the animal can't
wait, so we'll probably give it to the next person who stops by.""

This is not comforting to Pierce. She said the deputy could have come to the
ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose. With her
boyfriend, a hunter, nearby, she could have easily taken care of the animal
herself.

She knows her situation is probably a lost cause. But she hopes other
people, especially other women, do not have the same experience.

""What about people who don't know the law?"" she said. ""Standing up for my
rights has just been a big headache.""

I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up. In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example : rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY (this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages) Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who verify against an imported gpg key?

connect with found SMTP-servers and simulates the sending of message. It does
not come to the message sending ? /NOBR> EMV disconnect as soon as mail server
informs does this address exist or not. EMV can find about 90% of dead

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and /home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files back into place and you're ready to go. That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an /etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files, because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in /boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my computers to work for example).

My mom just notified me of my aunt Theresa's death. She was my father's older
sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail exchanges and a couple of
brief encounters as a child. This news came hours after I received ANOTHER bit
of disturbing news: ""Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last
weekend of a heart attack at home."" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's
group meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like a beefier
Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal with, but you never seem
to be prepared for it when someone actually dies. A few months ago, Aunt
Theresa sent word that she had seen my show. It was good to know that even
though we hadn't interacted much over the past few years, she was still able
to see me on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to Jon
than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a few months ago:

_""I evangelized for months last year for having our company at the first of
these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines last October, but got shot
down. The conference was a hit despite being postponed by 9/11, and having to
move the venue at the last minute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all
over again being 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this
year. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email publishing group
'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a friend of mine. He was the
'kid' hired by TechTV to host their Call for Help daily TV program in SF
starting last fall. If you get the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can
catch his show. I have my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily
basis. It's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole.""_

I returned from speaking to another user group the other night and found that
approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered. Sweet! When I started
looking closer at the numbers, I realized that Jake was offering his
Converting Vinyl LPs to CD eBook for free - and that's all anybody was taking.
No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them were just for that
particular title. Now, while I don't have a problem with Jake's offer, I do
want to encourage you to check out the non-free titles (and if you've already
looked, please look again). A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into them -
and they're just as helpful. In fact, Jake's also written one for OS X (which
probably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple machine).
Although, I'm sure plenty of you use Dreamweaver. Which reminds me: Jake's
also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly newsletter. So, if you haven't read
that in a while, I'd encourage you to give it another glance. After all, as
Elwood Edwards so finely said: You've Got Lockergnome! Thanks to David
Lawrence for making that MP3 a reality. El can make one with your name, too.
And yes, that's the AOL guy.

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

{Learn about your Ghia} Gearheads, motorheads, call them whatever you will,
but I've never been part of their ranks. Not that I don't like cars, mind you;
I find them much more useful than pogo sticks. If you happen to own a little
vehicle known as the Karmann Ghia, you should drive on over and download this
program. Click on any year between 1956 (the year it went into production) and
1974 to get a brief synopsis of the car and its changes for that year. You can
also get other specifications such as torque, horsepower, compression, etc.
Even if you're not ""into"" cars, check this out. This program was created for

page layout by compressing page width and enlarging text; and it supports
HTML, JavaScript, as well as other Internet standards in the same way. The
WebTV Viewer is not like a WebTV browser because: your computer monitor has a

**The Evidence is Against You**  
Scribbled by Jim Girard

Every time some new technology has expanded free access to popular music,
starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the 1930s, the recording
industry has fought it - claiming that it would cost them money. And every
time, it has resulted in increased sales. The best-known example, of course,
was the advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including
Dolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed by the music
industry as different from previous such developments, because it made it
possible for ordinary people to create their own copies at near-professional
quality. The actual result was the creation of a whole new profit center for
the music industry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became more
popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD technology).

The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect - and they are
not really aiming to stop the private exchange of songs in MP3 format. If that
were their goal, they'd be instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions
against all the server-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations
playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the phenomenon was
going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused on the best-known services
- first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA, and most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in
those cases, they've limited their legal challenges to things they know they
can win - and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to avoid
the possibility of setting some damaging precedent).

The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright is not a
property in the same sense as most of the things we think of as property. One
key difference is that if you don't defend it, you lose it. If you left your
car sitting in the driveway, with the window open and the keys in the
ignition, and somebody drove away in it, that would still be theft - and you'd
still be entitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are
aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you are
voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for the same reason
that big companies insist that newspapers put a copyright or trademark symbol
after the names of their products whenever they're mentioned, and not use
words like ""Coke"" or ""Kleenex"" as generic terms. They don't really expect
everybody to do what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of
one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a great
marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some point could start
using the word on their own product, arguing that it is in the public domain.

The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually stopping the
exchange of music between individuals - which they know from long experience,
increases their sales because most of the people who normally buy the music
aren't really satisfied with near-perfect copies. For most of them, the
learning curve and the cost in time of creating those copies themselves
outweighs the cost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is
committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the first place.
What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at establishing a public
record of their efforts to defend copyright, in the broadest, most public way;
to prevent anyone from making a legal claim that the stuff they own has
entered the public domain. The thing they're really worried about, in terms of
profits, is the change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music
commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a few good
songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for if they were buying
the stuff song by song. The problem is how to make as much money on a per-song
basis - and, at the moment, it requires charging far more for an individual
song that most people are willing to pay.

At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of civil law, with
a good deal of history behind it - dating back to the Renaissance. The
strategies music companies use are clearly directed to realities and
necessities, in light of history and case law. They have also done a great PR
job, convincing the most technically knowledgeable people on the Internet that
it is a simple moral or criminal issue. ""Common sense"" tells a lot of people
that copying music without paying for it is just like stealing someone's car,
and represents a loss to the owner. But if common sense could decide the issue
equitably, we wouldn't have the law in the first place. Most of our great
intellectual systems, including not only law but science, are designed in
large part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the case
in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those systems are well
aware of that, but they are also well aware that most people aren't - and that
it can work to their advantage. Any time a highly paid civil attorney begins
by telling you that an issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or
just a matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what he
means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you believe that.
If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't be paying him as much as he
is.

design a virtual model of yourself on this site. Choose your features like
body shape, eyes, nose, lips, facial hair, height, and weight. The amazing
thing is how closely your model resembles you. My only complaint is that you
can't add glasses. How in the heck is my digital doppelganger supposed to see?

Who has no trouble with controling his codes? Lockergnomie Wayne Smith: ""Here
is a bit of information specifically for Hotmail users who may have trouble
opening your links, due to the service wanting to place the referred URL in a
separate frame. I receive my Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it
really useful when you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this
isn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article. The trouble here is
that the link sometimes returns the message: 'There was an error displaying
this link' in the frame. No problem! Right-click, copy shortcut, paste to
metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM), then do a global search and replace.
The trick is to replace the control codes with the correct characters: %26 is
an ampersand; %3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a
forward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark. The Windows
character map can help with any others. Select a character, look at the status
bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the percent sign. In other words, the ampersand
(U+0026) is %26 which translastes into a '&' symbol. Maybe a more clever
Gnomie can come up with some script which we can place in the 'Web' folder,
correctly register, and use in IE's right-click / context menu?""

However, APT seems to want a recompile - its sometimes leaving the RPM database in need of a db_recover - and gcc 3.2 seems to require a closer adherence to the standard than the C++ in APT was written for. This is a bit of a bummer. Does anyone know if there's a latest version I could try which might work, or whether I should simply do the porting myself? (I've made a start, but there's a fair amount of work to do.) If this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled on vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's interested.

Well, I'm sure you can recompile those game packages without ALSA anyway.

FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

From: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC.


Sir/Madam;

This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
distribution.
  
We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
Applications Monitor) capability.
The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
applications as you
have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
MAM capability expands third party application ""control"" of a Watchdog as
access to the application's
source code is no longer needed.

Here is how it all works:
Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
executable program that they wish for monitoring.

A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
continuous operation.

It's that simple!

Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
Watchdogs.

Watchdog Control Center Features:
- Automated installation
- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
- User selectable Watchdog timeout period
- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
- Multiple Application Monitoring

Included on the Installation CD:
- Watchdog Control Center
- Watchdog Drivers
- Documentation

Niall O Broin <niall@linux.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Thu, 1 Aug 2002 15:51:12 +0100",[ILUG] Strange ssh problem,"I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh.
Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This
works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our
external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries
to ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't
they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys
but that didn't help. 

I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh
directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a
password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into
the agent).

In case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from
alfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership
afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.

We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is below

debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: input_userauth_pk_ok: pkalg ssh-dss blen 434 lastkey 0x80916f0 hint -1
debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickey

and before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfio said:

1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)

whereas with alfred the same segment of the debug log went

debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /nfshome/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password

and before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfred said:

1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)


This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he
logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home
directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don't have any
problems.

we're not tracking lettuce heads -- we're tracking the *idea* of a 
lettuce head in a capitalist system, an ownership relation.

Besides, in the worst case, these damn object ID's aren't very 
compressible. Best representation of a unique head of lettuce I can 
think of is... that very head of lettuce.

Of course, an accumulator is much easier to write, since the Pauli 
Exclusion Principle guarantees that adding a head of lettuce to a bin is 
an _atomic operation_

the ""independent"", a shopper's newspaper in the sf bay area, (the

aug 24, 2002:

""Dot-com downturn linked to domestic violence""

Domestic-violence worker Kathy Black remembers watching the Nasdaq 
take a nastydive on MSNBC, in March 2000.

""I knew then that we would have a lot of work on our hands,"" Black said,
referring to the caseload at La Casa de las Madres, the city's largest
organization serving women and children affected by domestic violence.

She was right.

Calls to La Casa's crisis line increased by 33% in the last financial
year, and the service saw a 10 percent increase in the demand for
beds, with 232 women and 215 children utilizing the shelter service.
...

Black said the dot-com collapse and a growing awareness of La Casa's
services were the two main reasons for the increase in calls.

She said many of her clients had partners who were employed in
service-industry jobs utilized by dot-com workers

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.

I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.

We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 

If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.

Yours faithfully,

Lance <lance_tt@bellsouth.net>,rpm-zzzlist@freshrpms.net,01 Feb 2002 00:53:41 -0600,Re: Please help a newbie compile mplayer :-),"Make sure you rebuild as root and you're in the directory that you downloaded the file.  Also it might complain of a few dependencies but you can get these at freshrpms.net, except for gcc3, which you can find on your Red Hat cd, Red Hat ftp, or rpmfind.net. After you rebuild the source rpm it should install a binary rpm in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386.  With all dependencies met, install mplayer with 'rpm -ivh mplayer-20020106-fr1.rpm' and you should be good to go. One last thing, you will need the win32 codecs, I found them on google, create a directory /usr/lib/win32 and place the codecs in there. Good Luck!

Dear Friend
 
 I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former
 President 
 of the Congo Republic. I am presently under
protective custody
 in Nigeria
 as
a political refugee. I got your contact over the internet during my
search for a
 stranger
 that
can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.i took this option because my family friends and associates cpuld not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present predicament.
 
I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us.
 However, 
you must confirm your ability to handle this because
it involves
 a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is
my share of
 my
 father's
estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security
company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. Now
the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.
 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:

1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence
number for
 identification
to the security company.
4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your full permanent address.
 
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose
 to 
you the name and the country of the security company.
I will
 forward your
name and particulars to the security company to enable
 them contact you
accordingly. I will also send to you a LETTER OF
AUTHORITY to
 enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this is a very
safe
 transaction as
this money is my share of my father'sestate.
 
 I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.
 
 Regards,

Not at 40,000 m. I found this article 
(http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,53928,00.html) :

""The last person to try to break the highest free fall record died in 
the attempt. In 1965, New Jersey truck driver Nick Piantanida suffered 
catastrophic equipment failure when his facemask blew out at 57,000 
feet. Lack of oxygen caused such severe brain damage that he went into a 
coma and died four months later.""

And in amongst the flash at

you can discover that he will break the sound barrier at 35,000 m,
presumably reaching top speed somewhere above 30,000.

And What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium

01. SECURE IE.  For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has 
been giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks 
Flash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize 
Security Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up 
to five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky 
notes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server 
(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts.  For what we believe 
is one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of 
software, check out what our Panel had to say at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews .  For a free trial download, 
visit http://www.secureie.com .  And if this one sweeps you off your feet, 
go to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super 
deal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14.  With a 30-day 
guarantee, what's to lose?

02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores 
with Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking 
on your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup 
button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.

03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of 
less-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom 
Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue.  It says 
it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and 
technology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.

. . . . .

West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now 
enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane 
is our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on ""Recommend NNT.""  Nothing could 
be easier.

. . . . .

04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.  To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 
to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter 
key then takes you home.

05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at 
http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that 
displays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the 
more relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions 
are revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more 
complicated than the service itself.  Just try it.

. . . . .

You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products 
there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. 
Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, 
and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the 
usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check 
us out, you'll be glad you did.

. . . . .

06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore 
required a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a 
programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset 
that often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems 
tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.

07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn 
will begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, 
consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection 
of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.

08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working 
with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way 
to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and 
click/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, 
it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with 
the first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the 
application with which it was created.

09. QUICK ACCESS.  To go to a frequently used program, you may find 
yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut 
icon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide 
quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and 
select Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can 
remember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application 
whenever needed.

10.  DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL.  We've been asked about those emails with 
virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a 
confirmation of a subscription.  Don't believe it, and don't open the 
attachments.  Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) 
will clear things up:

NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus 
that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged 
subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at 
all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a 
widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will 
all around.  Is there some configuration that we could change to keep 
these from going out except to legitimate subscribers?

Lyris:  Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it 
isn't actually ListManager doing the sending.  The real problem is that 
people sometimes will add the ""join"" address to their address book and 
that is what causes the problems.  The best we can do is advise people not 
to have their address books set to automatically add any email address 
that they send a message to even once.  The main culprit here seems to be 
Outlook Express.

WHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK:  Another batch of Neat Net Tricks in the Premium 
issue, including:

*  A great collection of information and free downloads to make your system 
more secure.

*  Free software to measure and display your real-time Internet speed.

The mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice.

The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing.  The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy.

We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11.

After Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil Liberty

August 4, 2002
By THE NEW YORK TIMES 




 

This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil
A. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. 

In the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John
Ashcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal
government and ""every available statute"" to hunt down and
punish ""the terrorists among us."" 

The roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with
wartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions
of more than 1,200 people suspected of violating
immigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or
fighting for the enemy. 

The government's effort has produced few if any law
enforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been
released or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held.


But it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being
waged in federal courthouses around the country, that
experts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance
between individual liberties and national security. 

The main combatants are the attorney general and federal
prosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders,
immigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil
libertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other,
with federal judges in between. 

The government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As
it has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits,
the courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed
back, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's
tactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them.
Federal judges have, however, allowed the government to
hold two American citizens without charges in military
brigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map
for how they might even challenge their detentions. 

In the nation's history, the greatest battles over the
reach of government power have occurred against the
backdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current
restrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by
historical standards and in light of the risks the nation
faces. 

The current struggle centers on three sets of issues.
People held simply for immigration violations have objected
to new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret,
and they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on
what they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. 

People brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those
thought to have information about terrorist plots, have
argued that they should not be held to give testimony in
grand jury investigations. 

Finally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two
Americans labeled ""enemy combatants"" for what the
government contends is more direct involvement with
terrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be
fundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's
representation and a chance to challenge their detentions
before a civilian judge. 

So far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered
secret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny,
and on Friday a federal district judge in Washington
ordered that the identities of most of the detainees be
made public under the Freedom of Information Act. 

""Secret arrests,"" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the
decision on Friday, ""are a concept odious to a democratic
society."" 

A senior Justice Department official said the detentions
had been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to
""prove a negative"" and cite specific terrorist acts that
had been disrupted. But he said that department officials
believed that the detentions had ""incapacitated and
disrupted some ongoing terrorist plans."" 

Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on
whether the government may jail material witnesses while
they wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In
Virginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow
Mr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. 

""I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer
them on, because they are doing exactly what an independent
judiciary should be doing,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a
professor at the University of Minnesota and former
executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press. ""It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply
skeptical."" 

These lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet
been tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that
appeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more
sympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments. 

The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance,
reversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a
lawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider
additional evidence and arguments. 

But even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the
government's sweeping argument that the courts have no role
in reviewing the government's designation of an American
citizen as an enemy combatant. 

The detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of
the Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were
cabdrivers, construction workers or other types of
laborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before
being cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. 

Last month, at a conference held by a federal appeals
court, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the
Clinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant
attorney general under President Bush, saying that the
administration's refusal to identify the people it had
detained reminded him of the ""disappeareds"" in Argentina. 

""I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the
mothers marching in the streets asking for the names of
those being held by the government,"" Mr. Christopher said.
""We must be very careful in this country about taking
people into custody without revealing their names."" 

Mr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from
Vietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was
taken away in 1975 for ""re-education."" In contrast, he
said, those detained by the United States were not being
secretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek
lawyers. 

""These are not incognito detentions,"" he said. ""The only
thing we will not do is provide a road map for the
investigations."" 

According to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than
1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on
immigration charges. Officials said recently that 81
remained in detention. Court papers indicate there were
about two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other
detainees were held on various state and federal criminal
charges. 

President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected
foreign terrorists before military tribunals, though no
such charges have been brought yet. 

Last month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding
in Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a
British citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his
shoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very
establishment of those tribunals ""has the effect of
diminishing the American jury, once the central feature of
American justice."" 

Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan,
added: ""This is the most profound shift in our legal
institutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all -
it has taken place without engaging any broad public
interest whatsoever."" 

Jack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the
University of Chicago Law School, have written that the
Bush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to
civil liberties especially compared with changes during the
times of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What
has changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil
liberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. 

The Secrecy 

U.S. Says Hearings 
Are Not Trials 

Ten days
after last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the
nation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping
instructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out
to be more than 600 ""special interest"" immigration cases. 

""Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all
other cases on the docket,"" Judge Creppy wrote. ""The
courtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no
family, and no press."" 

""This restriction,"" he continued, ""includes confirming or
denying whether such a case is on the docket."" 

The government has never formally explained how it decided
which visa violators would be singled out for this
extraordinary process, and it has insisted that the
designations could not be reviewed by the courts. 

But as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and
Muslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for
example at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious
neighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that
only a few of these detainees had any significant
information about possible terrorists. 

As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of
legal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking
legal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have
ordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable
skepticism about the government's justifications for its
detention policies generally. 

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the
hardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on
violations that in the past would not have resulted in
incarceration. 

""Preventive detention,"" he said, ""is such a radical
departure from constitutional traditions that we certainly
shouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice
Department's say-so."" 

Malek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had
it not given rise to one of the legal challenges that
threatens to end the secret proceedings. 

Mr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa
14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than
a decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven
an ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and
Naturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him
about a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr.
Zeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa
soon cost him 40 days in custody. 

When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his
detention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr.
Zeidan's cousin and reporters. 

The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal
court, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers.
In March, the government dropped the ""special interest""
designation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond,
and the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration
charges against him will be considered in the fall. 

""You're one of the lucky ones,"" his lawyer, Regis
Fernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other
visa violators were held as long as six or seven months
before being deported or released. 

Mr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy,
which focused on openness, forced the government's hand. 

""The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,"" Mr.
Fernandez said. ""We figured if the public had access to
these hearings they would see that nothing went on except
multiple adjournments and delay."" 

Through a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An
I.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be
named, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's
case and in similar cases. 

He said the immigration service had always detained people
without bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He
added that the agency had no choice now but to detain a
visa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was
sure the person was not involved in terrorism. 

""Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days
and then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he
was a terrorist,"" the official said. 

The newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once
reached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers
contain one of the fullest accounts of its position on
secrecy and executive power. 

Its main argument is that the courts have no role because
immigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely
administrative hearings that can be closed at will. 

Bennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he
was flabbergasted by this suggestion. 

""A trial is a trial,"" he said. ""A person's liberty is at
stake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being
told where to live."" 

But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases,
Dale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for
counterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I.,
outlined the reasoning behind the government demand for
total secrecy. 

""Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous
in isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist
groups,"" he said. 

This rationale for withholding information, sometimes
called the mosaic theory, is controversial. 

""It's impossible to refute,"" Professor Kirtley said,
""because who can say with certainty that it's not true?"" 

In May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal
district court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan,
ruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation
hearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is
able to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case
basis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the
month before, though that case involved only a single
detainee. 

The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge
Bissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court,
which will hear arguments in September, declined to do
that. A number of news organizations, including The New
York Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in
support of the newspapers. 

The government then asked the United States Supreme Court
to stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively
unusual move given that the case was not before it for any
other purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting
that it might have more sympathy for the government's
arguments. 

The Witnesses 

Rights Violated, 
Lawyers Contend 

Late on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled
two nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul
Mohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They
were carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000
in cash and had also shaved their body hair. 

The agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used
box cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and
had received letters instructing them to ""shave excess hair
from the body."" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said
there was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian
men were involved in, or ""were associated"" with, those
responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. 

But even though government officials told reporters that
the men had been detained as material witnesses, their
lawyers now say that they were held last fall only on
immigration violations. 

The distinction is important because a material witness
warrant brings the automatic appointment of a
government-paid lawyer, while the government does not have
to supply a visa violator with counsel. 

As a result, the authorities were able to question each of
the men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer
present, their current lawyers say. 

Like some of the people who were picked up as material
witnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails
in New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr.
Azmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did,
their lawyers say. 

""It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never
bring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,""
Mr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an
interview. ""It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney
at the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S.
investigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main
inquiry into the World Trade Center debacle."" 

Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his
client was interrogated ""often times for several hours a
day, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire
questions from three or four different people."" 

Eventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men
of any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in
June in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting
sentencing. 

Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men
consented to questioning. Each ""was read and waived his
Miranda rights before each interview,"" prosecutors wrote,
adding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses.


The United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey,
would not comment on the specific cases, but said generally
of the government's tactics: ""I don't see any violation of
any rule, regulation, or law. 

""I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,"" he
said. ""But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every
available tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole
field and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole
field. 

""We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate
and disrupt,"" he added. 

Today, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen
material witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being
detained. 

But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred
intense criticism. 

Last April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District
Court in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law ""to detain
people who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in
order to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of
the statute."" 

Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when
witnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for
grand jury investigations. ""Since 1789,"" Judge Scheindlin
said, ""no Congress has granted the government the authority
to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that
he will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal
investigation."" 

Then last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of
Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the
government's use of the material witness statute in grand
jury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's
reasoning. 

Judge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief
Justice John Marshall that ""the public has a right to every
man's evidence,"" held that detentions of material witnesses
during investigations are proper. 

The War Captives 

No Lawyers Allowed 
Under U.S. Label 

Yasser Esam Hamdi, a
Saudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably
an American citizen by virtue of having been born in
Louisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind
of role the nation's courts should have, if any, in
reviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged
with something akin to a war crime. 

Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in
Norfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal
judges who has shown resistance to the government's
approach that once someone is declared an ""enemy combatant""
by the president, all judicial review ceases. 

Judge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan,
has twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and
ordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal
public defender, to be allowed to visit him without
government officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar
said that ""fair play and fundamental justice"" require it.
He said the government ""could not cite one case where a
prisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United
States District Court, who was held incommunicado and
indefinitely."" 

But the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge
Doumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the
government's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and,
more important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of
foreign and military affairs. 

""The authority to capture those who take up arms against
America belongs to the commander in chief,"" Chief Judge J.
Harvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. 

But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at
the breadth of what the government was asserting when he
asked the Justice Department's lawyer, ""You are saying that
the judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's
stature as an enemy combatant?"" 

The government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide
the court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by
which they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant.
But the government has argued that judges cannot argue with
the standards. 

Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the
government closely on those standards. 

The case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far
as that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge
to normal judicial procedures. 

Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like
Mr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig
after having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike
Mr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield
by the military but on United States soil by civil law
enforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. 

After his detention as a material witness based on
suspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and
information to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred
to military custody. 

""This is the model we all fear or should fear,"" said Mr.
Dunham, the public defender. ""The executive branch can
arrest an American citizen here and then declare him an
enemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the
courts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him
or giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any
evidence.""

OK, so, you get the XML toss it through hardware and turn it back into a
struct/object whatever you call your binary data. I agree this is the way
things will go, as XML parsing has just too much overhead to survive in the
application layer. So why turn it into XML in the first place? Becasue it

This is exactly what I think. SpamAssassin has always been conservative
about adding unproven RBLs and such, and this should be the same.

I say start it with a zero score and put it in 70_cvs_rules_under_test like
any other unproven rule. Then score it based on actual results, not
promises. My corpus does not yet contain a single non-spam (or spam) message
with a Habeas mark. Based on that, it doesn't impress me and it wouldn't
impress the GA either. Rules with exactly the same statistics are being
dropped from SA right now, and I don't see why this should be any different.

NEWS July 16, 2002   i2corp Enters into Research and Development Agreement with Nevada Gaming Equipment Supplier For Live Remote Bingo.      
 
The general feeling of the Top Internet Lawyers and Analysts is that ""online gambling and sports betting is here to stay. Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. 

Whats more, there are NO competitors for the Companys method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with
Major Casinos Globally.    
 
Michael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations.  The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons. A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http://www.gamingobserver.com/.
 
i2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games. 

FACT: Currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant UUNET a subsidiary of MCI/WorldCom in a U.S. Federal Court for Patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude i2corps common stock to be overlooked and undervalued!

Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow - it is fast.  Comes with some lovely client tools
also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single

Given current trends, particularly in demographics, such conflict won't
be military.  Europe wouldn't stand a chance now and things are getting
worse in a hurry.  They are SOL.

Not to mention that when push comes to shove they wouldn't stand united.

Exsqueeze me, but what part of ""I don't know if it's true or not""
did you fail to grok?  I personally doubt it simply because I never
heard of Bush and Chirac going to Brighton.

- Presuming your run Bash  :
Note the directory lists 
#  perl -e 'map { print ""$_\n"" } @INC'
Then set up the Shell variable PERL5LIB variable (and put it in some .bashrc 
for future use)
# export PERL5LIB=""directory1:directory2:directory3:directory4""
Then try to install the software

PERL5LIB is explained perlrun(1) : do

How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. 
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

**Copies, Webcasts tangled in draft bill**  
Legislators are readying a bill that could sharply limit Americans' rights
relating to copying music, taping TV shows, and transferring files through the
Internet. At the same time, the draft legislation seen by CNET News.com would
place the struggling Webcasting industry on firmer legal footing.

**Sharp's Zaurus PDA suffers security holes**  
Sharp's Linux-based, business-oriented Zaurus handheld suffers from security
holes that could let hackers grab private data off a corporate network,
according to researchers at Syracuse University. In an advisory posted
Wednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said
they had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D
handhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system,
giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be
input through the keypad or touch screen.

**Outlook plug-in could let the hackers in**  
A widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users
encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and
left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye Digital Security
issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on
could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network
Associates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.

**ACLU: Don't rat out your customers**  
A clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers
to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous
critics. A group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is
urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe
legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously
air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than
100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers
know if they're targets.

**Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay**  
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have
been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal. The lawsuits, each
filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal
shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies'
fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for
PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory
filings on Thursday.

Unfortunately not, it's a one at a time thing.  If it would help
you, I have a script that I use which handles a mbox file at a time,
strips the SA stuff, reports to razor, and can then do things like
open relay checks, reports to spamcop, etc.  It's available via:

    a 486DX with a color LCD, detachable trackball mouse, AT&T 14.4 PCMCIA

 Don't buy it.

 shift-alt-s should start a shell, alt-d should maximise a window
vertically, alt-q should close a window, alt-w should shade it. These I've
used for about eight years, and I'm not about to change them now.

 Stuff like alt-1 to go to workspace-1, I love - it just appeared in
windowmaker about six years back, and I've also gotten used to it.

 Wierdly, I've gone back to sawfish & gnome 1.4 - and the keybindings
still don't work. It's not fair.

As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If 
I understand you:  If I don't use the ""nomime"" => 1 option and I recieve 
MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.

Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
""nomime"" => 1?

PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.

This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.

Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:

a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 

All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  

WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 

So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.

The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.

Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!

If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You dont need

Date: Not supplied

The DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, 
through ""a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
at pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with 
vibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:"" 

    Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling 
    system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, 
    along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be 
    evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed 
    data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable  such 
    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit  may now be possible. 

    With high-resolution seismic data collected ""ahead of the bit,"" operators 
    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet 
    spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency 
    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
    reservoir.

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time. Most
systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.

Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far
beyond the scope of the ""Learn Java in 90 minutes without thinking"" book
every Java programmer learned from.

**Slowing sales shrinking Intel workforce**  
Intel announced lower-than-expected earnings yesterday and that **4,000 jobs**
(5 percent of its staff) would be eliminated this year. This may bring Intel's
margins back in line, but the overall **outlook is not bright** in the coming
months, despite Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's optimism about a
more timely recovery.

**Software contracts: Clause for alarm**  
In the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued
sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's the **language in the
contracts**. Enterprise customers spend surprisingly little time pouring over
the fine print of multi-million dollar software contracts that are rife with
obscure terminology, vague expansion charges, and **mind-boggling license
conversions**. As a result, they end up paying in ways they had never imagined
long after the deal is signed. Just ask California.

**Rack server a la mode**  
With its Xserve rack-mount server, **Apple is moving into enterprise
territory**. The specs are impressive: Dual 1GHz PowerPC G4s, up to 2GB DDR
SDRAM, two 64-bit 66MHz PCI slots (plus a third combination PCI/AGP slot),
dual Gigabit Ethernet, FireWire and USB ports, and four Ultra ATA/100 Apple
Drive Module bays. But **Bill O'Brien** thinks Apple's **licensing** may be
even more appealing than the hardware.

By Omer Farooq
BBC reporter in Hyderabad

Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh.


The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed

Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.

The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.

It had not eaten for three weeks.

Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.

Garlanded

One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
failed because of the blind faith of the people.


The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.

The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.

Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
around the clock.

'Exploited'

Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
residents.

But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
mistreated.

They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
forcibly confined in the temple.

The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
exploited to make money.

The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.",0,0

Try the following newsgroups - 
Beginners:
news:comp.lang.learn.c-c++

More advanced: 
news:comp.lang.c
news:comp.lang.c++
news:comp.lang.c.moderated

Also, you should keep a bookmark pointing at the comp.lang.c FAQ at 
http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html

For tutorials, the guy who maintains the clc FAQ (Steve Summit)
has a tutorial - http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/notes/top.html
Also you could have a look at the excercises he poses - all
linked from http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/cclass.html

For C++, I would guess that the comp.lang.c++ FAQ is a good place
to start - they're likely to have links to suggested reading
material.

If you're going to do any amount of C programming, you should
think about getting K&R2 (The C programming language, 2nd
edition, by Kernighan and Ritchie), for C++ the equivalent book
is Stroustrup. Although the C++ book is a lot bigger :)

Hope this helps,
Dave.

Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.

If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.

Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I
blame law school and my cat.

sorry, i missed this.  redhat supplies something similar called kickstart
(guess who inspired them?).  pc hardware is dumb, so you'll need to use
a floppy.  otoh, every jumpstart config i've seen required rarp plus
plugging the new box's ethernet+ip into a file.  a kickstart boot can
just use a dhcp server.

Adds to the level of annoyance, and makes it even less likely that I'll

They don't have to.  All they have to do is use some program (which, if
they don't exist already, will certainly be around someday soon) that makes
every spam they send show the recipient as the ""from"" address as well.

The adding manually thing doesn't seem like much fun.  And, anytime I speak
to someone new, it just makes it more unlikely that they will be willing to
contact me.  Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be
amazed at how confused many people get by them as well.  They tend to
ignore the ""please apply"" messages.

As an aside, am I the only person around who simply does not use the
addressbook feature in email programs?  I never have, and I don't see any
reason to.  It (along with not opening attachments) has helped me not to
send out viruses to people.  I generally use my own brain or my inbox as an
addressbook, and search out the last email I received from someone and hit
reply...

Well, yes.  *I* use one email address, but that doesn't mean all my friends
do.  You would need to convince everyone I know of that.  Most people I
know, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty
others have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of
them for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which
email addresses are already approved and avoid using others.

Plus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email
address from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new
job info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to
tell them about your new job email address?

(apart from ipfw being in use a lot longer). Well, as someone who's used ipchains quite heavily about two years ago, I can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once you've memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is about before. It's not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over another, but if that's all there is in the difference, and the learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know what I'd prefer, as a beginner. This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I've been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped on the bandwagon. --    Philip Reynolds            RFC Networks          tel: 01 8832063 www.rfc-networks.ie      fax: 01 8832041 --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

 I don't really see the problem... either the whole message is unwanted spam
which you, one way or another, didn't agree to reciving, or it's something that
you, one way or another, said that you'd accept... If you said you'd accept it,
like mailinglists, then it isn't spam and shouldn't be caught as spam, no
matter if there's ads in it or not...

No, in my opinion, it's purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use,
which is the same thing) that we don't handle outages of network
services better.

The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I
have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around
the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.

Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have
real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different
periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the
trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->
favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor
lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very
accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).

I took some time out to make  RPMs of GStreamer for it. All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt  repository in a new ""redhat-80-i386"" directory. The repository for dependencies is again called ""deps"", and the one for  the gstreamer rpms is ""redhat"", because this time around the base distro  contains all the necessary packages. A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at http://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.png Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms : a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't  have a -devel package for it yet b) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve.

Does anyone know how to set up dual keyboards(one is actually a stand-alone
keypad)?
Both keyboards have PS/2 connections and I want the keypad to be plugged in
as the primary input device.  Then if the other keyboard is plugged in, that
should take over.
Possible?  Any possible hacks?

PLEASE READ THIS ALL!!!!!!!!! !!!! NOT A SCAM!!!! = !!! I REPEAT NOT A SCAM!!! THIS ONLY COST YOU 6.00 CASH!!! = INVESTMENT!!! IT DOES WORK!!! I found this on a bulletin board and = decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through = newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to = this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with = only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, Yeah right, this must = be a scam"", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. = Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address = stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the = bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 = newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after = thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about = trying it. I figured: ""what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and = $6.00, right?"" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... = Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I = figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my = first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had = made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 = and it's still growing. This is how my fourth week and I have made a = total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's = certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the = lottery!!(This is not me but i am also making alot of = money) Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, = WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so = you can get the information off of it, as you need it. I promise you = that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making = more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! = Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or = download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the as money comes = in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus = postage) IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; = it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works! If all of = the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive = extraordinary dividends. PLEASE NOTE: Please follow = these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 = days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and = integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully = adhering to the instructions. You will be part of the Mail Order = business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's = a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many = large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. = However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the = income, which is made from people like you and me asking to be included = in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to success: STEP 1: Get = 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of = paper ""PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST."" Now get 6 US $1.00 bills = and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not = be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one = paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 = sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, = your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating = a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate = service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little = skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I = checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they = confirmed that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following = addresses: #1) Mike Gordon, 204 South Maple St., Winchester, = KY.40391 #2) Jeff Waldrop, 39-A Lucy Rd., Laurel, MS 39443 #3) = Brian Thompson, 15 Briggs Pond WY. Sharon, MA 02067 #4) A. Guy , = 6127 Seabree LN, ,Ft. Wayne, In 46835 #5) Wes Armstrong, 157 = Butternut Rd., Shavertown, PA 18708 #6) Trista Friend, P.O. Box = 1265, Long Beach, WA 98631 STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the = list that you see above, move the other names up 1 place (#2 becomes = #1, #3 becomes #2, etc.) and add YOUR name and address as number 6 on = the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep = this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your = amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to = 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the = more money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy. = This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 = Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these = steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, = and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful = because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their = carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of = integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many = others have received will come your way. NOTE: You may want to = retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard = copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are = truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 = bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post = is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be = reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar = each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your = name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars = in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the = first six people listed above) Send it now, and add your own name to the = list and you're in business! -----DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO = POST TO NEWSGROUPS-------------- Step 1) You do not need to re-type = this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the = beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this = document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the = entire letter into the computer's memory. Step 2) Open a blank = 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From = the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter = into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step = 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your = postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back = to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching = for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, = discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this = article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and = selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will = be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of = postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're = done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to = do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang = of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! = **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU = WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** that's it! = You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You = may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of = mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent = a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE = ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. ** Now, each of the 5 persons who = just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at = #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another = $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at = #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, = those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at = #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! = OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM = 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, = that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this = message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per = 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original = investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the = list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out = another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. = And start posting again. Do you TURN 6 (six) DOLLARS INTO $6000 or even = $60000 EASY AND HONESTLY!!! The thing to remember is: do you = realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the = Internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! = So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... = People have said, ""what if the plan is played out and no one sends you = the money?"" So what! What are the chances of that happening when there = are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the = Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? = Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands = of those joining the actual Internet.

 Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5"" to 3.5"" IDE cable,
and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the
IDE cable too.

 Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.

ps: I have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal, and the
""colours from the ftoc"" stuff all deleted, and it is looking just about as
good as the old unseen window used to look.   I still have some work to
do to make it a little nicer (listboxes seem to have some strange habits)
and then I need to make it all optional and parameterized, at the minute
I'm just embedding stuff in the code, much quicker for prototyping.  Once
its done, I'll send a patch for someone to look over.

uh, no, you don't want to make it world-writable.  world-readable.

Just remember that the .razor and whatever DCC uses needs to be
world-readable as well.  The solution is then to make a world-writable
log file for at least Razor.  I like symlinking /dev/null myself.

efficient?  probably (depends on the user base), but it also takes
the control away from the user (which may or may not be a good thing,
depending again on the user base...)

Glen Gray <glen@netnoteinc.com>,ilug@linux.ie,07 Oct 2002 10:10:00 +0100,[ILUG] Retrieving read mail from webmail.eircom.net via POP ?,"Is there a way to get my read email downloaded off webmail.eircom.net.

I've been reading the emails using the web based interface. But I've
reached my quota limit. There doesn't seem to be any way to get the
emails off the server. I can connect to the account using POP, but that
only retrieves unread emails. There's also no way to mark emails as
unread from the html interface.

Is there a way I can use fetchmail perhaps to get it to pull down all
the emails and remove them off the server.

It's been years since I've used fetchmail, I don't recall be able to do
this.

Any other suggestions welcome. There's a few hundred email so I don't
fancy going through each one forwarding it to another account.

I don't know whether it suggests that, but they would be tagged differently
in to/cc if I were tagging them at all right now.  If I were tagging To:
addresses, for example, the tokens would look like

    'to:email addr:mit'

instead of

    'email addr:mit'

as they appear when an email-like thingie is found in the body.  Whether
email addresses should be stuck in as one blob or split up as they are now
is something I haven't tested.",0,0

Craig,

    I don't really understand how you can make the claims that you
    make without a full understanding of TeS, which you can't have
    because we haven't published the details.

    In the end, given that you don't know much about TeS or how it
    works, your statements really call into question your intentions
    given that you have a competing product in this space.

ext2 can mount an ext3 partition, but there are
probably small changes required (to the BIOS)
to support this?

Not knowing one whit about elliptic curve math, can you provide 
some expert interpretation of these results?

It looks like the old record for, say, 199 bits, has been
blown out of the water by a factor of ~100,000.

Does this mean that Eliptic Curve encryption is
now easily breakable? Or faster than before with
no loss in strength? Or stronger?

Raw bits are OK, cooked bits are better.

Easy.

First, you'll have to excuse me as I'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this
may not play well with recent changes.  (I did look at 2.5.1, too).
And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it
(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.

Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:

*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:		Catch-up all b4 cur
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	My_Mark2CurSeen

Then you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and 
arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory
in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the ""source hook""
under Prefs->Hacking Support)

It's going to look something like this:

proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set pick(ids) [...get message ids for ""pick 1-cur""...]
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}

(that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)

You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of
time!

Naw, I still disagree, again because if I'm going to be so loose
with the definitions, then I'd have to say that I myself am a
genetically engineered organism.  But I'm natural, baby.  My parents
were attracted to each other's phenotypes, mixed some genes in the
hopes that those genotypes would get in there, and grew me around
them.  Sure, they engineered the process when they selected each
other.  But they didn't engineer the genetics.  If genetic enginering
wasn't such an important topic today, it wouldn't be such an important
distinction.

I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing
against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -
""we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any
caution today"".

You don't use break? What about case statement blocks, or leaving a for

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
ByScott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=========================================================================

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3)technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowers 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

Venture Capitalists Are Taking the Gloves Off
By LYNNLEY BROWNING

The venture capital world is looking less like a genteel club and more like
a brawling barroom.

Venture capitalists are offering the companies they bankroll increasingly
hard-knuckled deals that leave little wealth for a start-up's managers or
original backers. The moves are leading some entrepreneurs, desperate for
money, to decry today's investors as bullies. Some venture capitalists are
even suing rival venture firms, asserting that the tough new terms are
wiping out the value of their previous investments.

""People are playing hardball,"" said Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at
Charles River Ventures, based in Waltham, Mass.

The bursting of the Internet stock bubble more than two years ago wiped out
many venture investments in dot-coms. Now, amid the bear market in stocks
and limited prospects for investors or young companies to make money soon,
venture capitalists are looking for novel ways to make money. As a result,
""private companies are facing the most onerous terms from venture
capitalists that we have seen in 20 years,"" said Steven E. Bochner, a
securities lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif.,
who represents venture firms.

In the boom of the late 1990's, venture capitalists chose one of two
options. They could be paid back their invested capital, share in profits
and receive dividends. Or they could convert their preferred shares into
common stock when the private company held an initial public offering or
was sold. During that time of huge payouts for newly public and acquired
companies, they usually chose No. 2.

But with markets now all but dead for initial public offerings and mergers
and acquisitions, venture capitalists from Silicon Valley to the East Coast
are increasingly demanding - and getting - both options. This ""double dip,""
known as ""participating preferred,"" leaves far less potential wealth for a
company's founders and previous investors. Venture capitalists are also
negotiating more deals with heightened ""liquidation preferences,"" in which
start-ups agree to pay back the initial investment at least two or three
times over.

Previously, venture capitalists handed over money to a start-up in a lump
sum. But more are now parceling out funds in tranches, and then only when
the new companies reach certain milestones - a sales target, for example,
or the hiring of a particular chief executive.

They are even trying to protect their investments through veto rights that
permit them to block future investments from other venture capitalists who
might dilute their stakes, said Mark G. Borden, chairman of the corporate
department at Hale & Dorr, a law firm based in Boston. As a result, Mr.
Borden said, a start-up company that casts its lot with a particular
venture capitalist or group of investors may find itself tethered to those
backers and unable to raise new money elsewhere.

ENTREPRENEURS particularly dislike one recent trend: venture capitalists
have been pushing young companies to agree, retroactively, to lower the
prices that investors now pay for shares should the start-up be worth less
when it tries to raise more money later. Such a move, known as a ""full
ratchet,"" is intended to prevent an investor's stake from being diluted.
But it can significantly reduce or even wipe out the stakes of a company's
original investors and managers, giving the new investors most of the
company for a song.

""If you were in the first round of investors, you generally now get
crushed"" when a start-up raises more money later, said J. Edmund Colloton,
general partner and chief operating officer of Bessemer Venture Partners,
based in Wellesley Hills, Mass.

Consider Mahi Networks, a private optical networking start-up. In three
rounds of financing, from September 1999 to November 2001, Mahi raised $110
million from blue-chip venture firms like Benchmark Capital, Sequoia
Capital, the GE Capital unit of General Electric and the venture arm of
Goldman Sachs. At one point during the Internet boom, Mahi was valued at
more than $180 million.

Last month, though, a new group of smaller-name investors, led by St. Paul
Venture Capital of Minneapolis, acquired about three-quarters of the
company for $75 million in financing. Before that, Mahi was valued at only
$25 million, said Chris Rust, Mahi's president and chief executive. But
most of that was tied up in employee incentives, including stock options,
leaving almost no value for existing investors.

Despite having nurtured Mahi with money and advice, the early investors
chose not to back the company further. With the new, lower valuation,
""there was effectively no value attributed to all of our previous
investments,"" said one venture capitalist whose firm was an early backer.
""We were all completely washed out"" in the last round, said the investor,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

There is no hard data on the prevalence of the newer, tougher terms.
Venture capitalists are famously secretive about their deals, which are
private and largely unregulated. But ask venture capitalists or securities
lawyers who work with start-ups, and tales of onerous terms will abound.
""At the end of the day, the money is coming with strings attached,"" said
Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, a
trade group based in Arlington, Va.

The shift has turned the conventional wisdom on its head. Venture
capitalists once loved risk, but no more. The Internet bust and Wall
Street's slump have left them scrambling to make money to repay their own
investors and to justify their management fees.

Venture capitalists once clamored to be first in the door of a hot new
company. Now they can usually make money only by being the most recent
investor. ""We're certainly looking for later-stage deals, where you get the
benefit of the previous investors having taken the risk,"" said Todd Dagres,
a general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass.

Some entrepreneurs agree to the harsh new terms simply because they have no
other way to raise cash to survive. But other managers now shun the
investors, whom they call ""vulture capitalists,"" bent on picking the meat
off a young or struggling start-up. Today's venture capitalists ""want to
take advantage of you,"" said George R. Waller, chief executive of Strike
Force Technologies, an employee-financed software maker in West Orange,
N.J. Mr. Waller said he had turned away 30 venture firms in recent months
because they had demanded, among other things, hard-to-reach sales
milestones.

George J. Nassef, chief executive of ValetNoir, a start-up based in New
York that makes marketing software for casinos, said several venture firms
had even asked in recent months to have their potential investments secured
with receivables, or money owed to ValetNoir by its customers. He turned
them all down.

NOT surprisingly, the shift in financing terms is upsetting some venture
firms that were early investors in start-ups but are now suffering as the
companies seek to raise additional money at bargain-basement prices.

In one high-profile case, Benchmark Capital, a blue-chip Silicon Valley
firm, sued the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Juniper Financial
this month. Benchmark was an early investor in Juniper, an online financial
services concern, having put $20 million into it in early 2000, just before
the Internet bubble burst. It also contributed to a second, $94 million
round that September. Juniper, based in Wilmington, Del., is seeking to
raise $50 million from Canadian Imperial, which already owns around half
the company, but on terms that would sharply dilute Benchmark's original,
unspecified stake. Benchmark sued to prevent the start-up from raising the
money. All the parties declined to comment on the case, which a Delaware
judge threw out last week.

Such friction was rare during the boom, when venture capitalists operated
like a competitive but tight-knit fraternity, channeling deals to one
another. Start-ups and their backers saw their interests as allied. But in
tighter markets, ""there's a lot of ugly behavior coming out,"" said Mr.
Bochner, the Wilson Sonsini lawyer. ""There's going to be much more
litigation like this.""

However, the additional  information won't be required. The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as  campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the  same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous  political spam. Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had  asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring  financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would  use up too much of the 160 character-maximum. Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from  the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was  supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular  Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade  groups. FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the  commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the  potential to reach more voters. ""We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before  everyone understands how the technology is going to work,"" he said. Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or  allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political  messages while remaining anonymous. Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface. Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as  ""good for America."" ""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running  for office,"" he said.

###  **Government Personal and Business Grants Facts:**

**Over 20 Million People Get Government Money Every Year:**

1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money to start or expand a business

4,000,000 people get money to invest in real estate

6,000,000 people get money to go to college

10,000,000 people get free help and training for a better job

  
---  
  
##  **Getting Business Grants**

> Anyone thinking about going into business for themselves, or wanting to
> expand an existing business should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-
> money-shop"" where FREE business grants to start or expand a business is
> being held for you by the Federal Government.

It sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source of
free business help delivers:

Over $30 billion dollars in free business grants and low-interest loans;

over one-half trillion dollars in procurement contracts; and

over $32 billion dollars in FREE consulting and research grants.

> With an economy that remains unpredictable, and a need for even greater
> economic development on all fronts, the federal government is more willing
> than it ever has been before to give you the money you need to own your own
> business and become your own boss!

In spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly huge
that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for an equal
share, they would each receive over $70,000.

Most people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who to
contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do receive
FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you should also.

Do you ever wish you could easily call people you know in other countries
for up to 85% less than standard call prices?! And then to make these savings
without having to subscribe to any low cost calling service?! We have now
launched a product that does exactly that!

You can now call people in most popular destinations around the world for
only 33 cents per minute! There are no hidden charges, you do not need to
signup, use any credit cards, or pay any extra bills! You can try this
service at no risk and choose to use it with no commitment!

To use this new service, simply dial our access number 1530 927 055 and
once connected, dial the actual international number you wish to call.

For more information and the current list of countries you can call, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/

Example: If you wanted to call a German number 0567 123 124 you would:

1) Dial 1 530 927 055
2) Wait until you connect to our system and hear a message asking you
   to dial the number you wish to call.
3) Dial the full international number starting 00. In this instance 00
   (for international) 49 (country code for Germany) 567 123 124 (their
   number without the initial zero)

You will only pay 33 cents per minute to access our system with no further
charges for any calls you make! You can also use this service to make
cheap international calls from mobiles too! However please check the
costs of calling 1530 numbers from your mobile if you are unsure.

You only ever pay for the cost of calling our access number which will
appear on your normal bill. However any international calls you make will
not appear on your bill, so you only ever pay 33 cents per minute when
using our service!

If calling from a mobile, please ensure that you do not press the green/send
key again after dialling the actual mobile number, or you will be billed
for a second call by your mobile operator.

If you have any questions or wish to contact us for more information, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/ for details.

If you are not interested in reducing your phone bills and would not like to
be informed of any other similar offers from ourselves, please reply to this
message with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject heading. If you have your
email forwarded, please ensure that you unsubscribe from the actual account
email is sent to. We apologise if this message has inconvenienced you in any

Why not... it's just that sometimes it gets a bit more confusing in the spec file since you have to change the ""Source:"" as well as ""%setup"" to reflect the name changes. But it might also sometimes be even easier the way you suggest, if the entire package contains only references to the final version and that only the archive name has a ""pr1"" or ""beta6"" in it for example. Take for instance xmame : I've been packaging 0.61 pre-releases as ""0.61-fr0.x"" since the entire source has only ""0.61"" tags everywhere, no preversion tags whatsoever. Still, I don't think ""Epoch:"" is an evil hack although it's true that it may cause problems between distributions when used.

One of the weirdest things I heard when listening to the Cato Institute debate 
was an economist claim ""a tenet of my profession is that people won't pay for 
something they can get for free."" Someone objected, using the analogy of 
bottled water. There's a far better example: The New York Times.  

Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality 
professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in 
trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to 
people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an 
insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called ""the Web"" by typing in the 
keyword ""www.nytimes.com"". Those people at the New York Times must not 
understand the Internet or something! 

More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian 
and others. 

Other times, people claim that no one will create if they can't get paid. I'd 
like to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the 
planet.",0,1

No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
environmentalists, which was my original point.

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Putting on the brakes[1]. &#8220;So, the answer to the 
question that started this whole project, ""what is the RDF in RSS 1.0 good 
for?"" is two things: it's good for someone who has an infinitely large database 
that can be queried infinitely fast by a schema-aware program, or it's good for 
writing a schema-aware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do 
with new elements that it hasn't seen before. That's actually an interesting 
project with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the 
whole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.&#8221; 
- _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2]. 
&#8220;RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? 
Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? TRAMP may or 
may not be the answer to these problems!&#8221; Complete with an example of

- _Dan Connolly_: HyperRDF: Using XHTML Authoring Tools with XSLT to produce 
RDF schemas[3]. &#8220;XML syntax is a little tedious, but lots of people are 
evidently willing and able of editing it by hand. RDF adds another layer of 
tedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make 
heavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in 
RDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have 
been writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.&#8221; Also includes a cogent 
explanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML.

 This is actually a raq3. Though, I do have an old raq2 that Liam was
helping me get netbsd on (about all you'll get on a 16MB machine these
days).

 Anyway, I wussed out, and copied hda1:/ to hda2:/boot and set the bootfs
to be hda2. It worked, though it's mounting an ext3fs as ext2. But I'm
getting there.

Your sysadmins are wrong.

Whatever program that is used to store the mail into the 
braindead ""mailbox"" file (/var/spool/mail/whatever) is supposed 
to escape a line that begins with From.  That program is called 
the local Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)

It would be better if you never, ever, stored your mail in a 
""mailbox"" file.

If your sysadmins are capable of it, get them to set up the 
receiving Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to allow the use of procmail 
as the local MDA.  Then use procmail to invoke rcvstore and 
deliver your mail directly into your MH mail folders.

Most Linux systems come configured this way, if a user has a
$HOME/.procmail file then mail is delivered using procmail.

What the WSJ said, appended below. The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle, expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good"" of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest nation. Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in government. As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will be ""granted"" away  in a potlatch that only government, and special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize to such perfection. All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name. *Commerce*. If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called ""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism, foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide. If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event. And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear. In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries, economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition and statism. It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but it's going to happen sooner or later. And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the World Trade Center. Cheers, RAH - ------- http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html The Wall Street Journal September 11, 2002 REVIEW & OUTLOOK A Living Memorial As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one. The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions, especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery. But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership, and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better, more prosperous city. This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided. A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas - -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site. We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be. In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University, you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names. In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future. Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover. Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273 fgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2 =09az -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- --  ----------------- R.

It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify. Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, ""If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath."" The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- ""without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world,"" quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter. One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's  time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant. The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing  details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. ""Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially,"" the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May 2001. Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains.

This isn't a MIME message that it is breaking down though.  The
message as sent to me is just a regular one part, non-MIME message.
The contents of the message among other things is a forwarded message
(inline not as an attachment) that happens to have MIME parts.

I see 1-4 documented in the manpage.  2 looked like a good candidate
but the manpage states that only 1, 3, and 4 are on by default.  No
mention of method 5 though that I can see.

Actually I am using 2.14.

I have to run off to a meeting but I'll send you a copy of the logs
and the message that triggered as SPAM when I get back.  I'll also
revoke it along with the other 3 similar messages and the Security
Advisory that were wrongly called SPAM this morning.

Thanks.

Doesn't apply to this one; you're off by three orders of magnitude.
Only 2km diametre, this one.  Of course, that's still a lot of mass
to hit the planet even if it *is* in the form of dust and gas.
Even if Shrub's wrist-rocket managed to vaporise it, we'd still get

**Moore: Speech recognition next hurdle**  
Speech recognition will be the next transforming technology, but that
transformation may take another 50 years, says Intel co-founder Gordon Moore.
Honored this week with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Moore took time to
talk about the slowing down of his well-known law, the economy, philanthropic
priorities, and more.

**Cyberterrorists don't care about your PC**  
Forget about viruses. America's real cybersecurity concerns are the
notoriously vulnerable computer systems that control our **power and water
supplies**. Robert Vamosi offers a few ideas about how to keep the
infrastructure safe.

**Tech shores up Homeland Defense**  
Computer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President
Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed
the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or cybersecurity.
But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about
**tech-savvy terrorists** \--and insisting any new agency must shield the U.S.
from **electronic attacks** as well.

**Novell's new identity**  
Novell seems to understand where today's sweet spot is: providing enterprises
with the tools they need to manage and deliver **Web services** against the
identities of employees, partners, and customers. Novell, a leading Web
services company? It just may pull it off, says Tech Update's **Eric Knorr**.
Are you looking for solutions to your **identity crisis**? Do you think Novell
can provide them?

**ROI calculators don""t tell the whole TCO story**  
In response to David Berlind""s  **Dell's formula for ROI**, TCO consultant
**Tom Rankin** warns that ""99 percent of TCO tools do not look at the 'total'
but may look at whatever parameters suit the vendor to sell their
products/services."" His advice to clients: ""Make sure they can write a check
to the CFO after three months.""

I don't know from Pyzor, but I've always thought that the way services like
Razor and DCC could be truly useful is if there were a bunch of different
ones. We can assign them scores based on how trustworthy each one is, and
when a message is listed in multiple services you can pretty much trust that
it's spam.

------- Additional Comments From alan@rdrop.com  2002-09-05 22:22 -------
I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...

The Wall Street Bulletin

_**Your First Source For News From ""The Street""**_

Symbol: **IGTT**  
Shares Outstanding: 373,400,0000  
Float (est.): 52,560,000  
Short-Term Target: $3.75  
52 week High/Low: $1.10/0.02

**Our last pick Symphony Telecom (OTCBB: SYPY) went UP 100% in just one
week!!!**

_InDigiNet Identifies Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35
Million..._



**Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate**

The Wall Street Bulletin believes that the recent investment of capital into
Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, is further proof of the continued validity of
the telecommunication market when looked at from the perspective of the small
to mid-sized enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future
may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to
remain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. ""Every major
industry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar
transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the
mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert
Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.
Christopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all the people
that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving
carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few
millions."" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the
link at the end of this newsletter._

As we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)
has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As
InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this
company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.
This could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our
Highest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.



**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**

We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.
A similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),
share price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over
$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously
had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267
million.

IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for
potential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a
few months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an
increase of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time
is right for investors to get in on the ground floor.



**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**

InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-
sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet
is a prestigious ""Diamond"" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for
Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to
offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building
a communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer
bases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its
acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then
expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance
profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data
services and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and
this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten
years. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.

**The __ IT Market**

Based on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag
significantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including
Internet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT
spending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7
percent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market
researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.
In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in
the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436
billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect
growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will
experience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market
will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,
India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_



**Particulars**

The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth
recommendation list for the following reasons:

1\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,
single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the
acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution
channel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,
wireless, and data.

  
2\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range
communities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the
value of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing
campus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic
Committee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.

  
3\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to
acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and
smaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the
targeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to
purchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.



**Investment Consideration**

InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,
2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1
2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for
their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and
more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to
small to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars.

**Techs gain on Intel, Motorola news**  
Although computer chip titan Intel posted lower-than-expected earnings, its
upbeat forecast helped lift technology shares Wednesday.

Also boosting the sector was Motorola, which beat expectations for operating
earnings and predicted a net profit in the last two quarters of the year.
CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the
tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to
1,397.23.

With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings
estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent,
to 8,542.48. The S&P; 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.

**Motorola Sees Profit Rebound**  
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects
to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by
aggressive cost cutting. Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly
loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a
share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated
earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215
million related to previously announced restructuring actions. The world's
second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a
third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut
another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.  
**MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27%**

**Apple meets lowered expectations**  
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched
analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools
fell short of the company's initial hopes. The company earned $32 million, or
9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year
ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48
billion Analysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share,
according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the
range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6
billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents
per share.  
**APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49%**

**HP, EMC storage systems to work better together**  
SAN FRANCISCO - Hewlett-Packard Co. and EMC Corp. said on Wednesday that they
were opening up technology to each other in order to maker their storage
systems work better together. However, the deal will not include technology
from Hitachi Data Systems, which makes the hardware for HP's high-end storage
system, an HP spokesman said. The deal follows close cooperation between
storage heavyweight EMC and Compaq Computer Corp., which was acquired by HP in
May.

Analysts Eric Ross and Sam Chang reiterate a ""strong buy"" rating on the
computer chip giant after it reports second-quarter earnings below the
consensus Wall Street estimate. Ross and Chang expect a modest seasonal
increase in demand in the second half of this year, with strength in consumer
laptop buying. Calling Intel the premier semiconductor firm, they suggest the
stock is a bargain.

Error 230 occurs when you report a signature, but the server doesn't
know about the signature, so it wants the full content.  It's
basically an optimization. =20

Beyond that, I'm not sure how to interpret that output.. what version?

Oksana Svetlova <oksana@antee.com>,<webmaster@taint.org>,"Wed, 27 Feb 2002 06:34:18 +0400",Proposal for cooperation,"Hello. I meant to contact http://taint.org webmaster,
Am I correct, I hope?

Actually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write 
you before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of 
her too.

So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.

I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, 
possibly you will find it interesting.

People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?

The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from
Russia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for
considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or 
pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all
programming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content
writing, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may
accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and
devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.
Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more
features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from
$12, and an average of $18 an hour.

I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.html

As for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their
specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.
So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet 
deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant 
is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also 
their company has local consultants in many states throughout the 
USA, in Europe and Australia.

So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?

Thank you very much,
Oksana Svetlova.
oksana@antee.com

PS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me 
know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.",1,1

True, but that's the thinking of today, that the company mailserver can be closed to you from the outside; because as it is today you can use any mail- server that you've got access to. If there's a good reason for setting it up they won't be that lazy in the future. > However, requiring mailservers to sign the Received: header...  That > could be useful.

A simple RFC could fix that today, either using a new header or extending the Received-header with a code/value that the server later on can verify; maybe something like this: Received2: Date: [date]; 	Local: sub.dom2.tld (IP#2); 	Remote: sub.dom3.tld (IP#3); 	Env-id:  	Code: [cache#, salted hashvalue, rsa or other signature]  And then you have the two optional From and To, only added by the sending server that's identified the local sender or the server accepting mail for a certain user (to verify that it did really come via that server, in case you forward it using procmail or something like it).  You of course would need some standard for how to check these headers.  Not perfect, but better than what we have today. 	/Tony --  # Per scientiam ad libertatem! // Through knowledge towards freedom! # # Genom kunskap mot frihet! =*= (c) 1999-2002 tony@svanstrom.com =*= #     perl -e'print$_{$_} for sort%_=`lynx -source svanstrom.com/t`' ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk",0,1

**The tech side of homeland defense**  
Computer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President
Bush's proposal for a Department of Homeland Security, as politicians fret
about tech-savvy terrorists--and insist that any new agency must shield the
United States from electronic attacks. Meanwhile, the administration says that
it's open to the idea of a chief privacy officer for the agency.

**Studios sue defunct $1 movie site**  
The movie studio's trade association filed suit Tuesday against Film88.com, a
would-be Internet video Web site that has allegedly popped up in several
incarnations around the world. Calling the site a ""piratical, virtual 'video-
on-demand' business,"" the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and its
member studios sued the company and an individual allegedly associated with it
in a California federal court.

**$215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down**  
Networking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it
has closed its doors due to a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the market
it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's plans.
Pluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the past
few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to
outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco
Systems.

**Apple to expand iMac LCD display**  
Apple Computer plans to serve up a new iMac model with a larger flat-panel
display during next week's Macworld Expo trade show, according to sources. The
upgrade to a 17-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) comes as sales have all but
stalled on existing 15-inch flat-panel iMacs. Apple unveiled the original
flat-panel iMac, which suspends the monitor from a pivoting arm attached to a
hemispherical base, during January's Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

**NextCard cuts off credit card customers**  
Federal regulators on Wednesday deactivated hundreds of thousands of credit
cards belonging to former customers of NextCard. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC), which had been trying unsuccessfully to sell the 800,000
accounts since taking them over in February, shut them down after they failed
certain performance measures over the past three months, said David Barr, an
FDIC spokesman. Although NextCard customers will no longer be able to use
their cards to make purchase or cash withdrawals, they will continue to be
responsible for their outstanding balances.

I'm new to SpamAssasin so I appologies if the question has been asked
before.
I'm thinking of setting up SA with my Qmail(Maildir) server acting as our
gateway.
It currently provides inline virus scanning and ORDB open relay filtering.
Is it possible to setup SA to act as a sitewide Spam filter ?
Is there any documentation on setting this up ?
The Qmail server does not house any local mail accounts, it acts as a pure
relay for our internal mail server, I am currently relaing mail for 8
internal domains...

Suggestions would be appreciated.

Regards
Zenn

_Premium Phone Qualified  
Business Opportunity Leads  
  
_If you're spending money marketing a Business **Opportunity** or **MLM** ,  
you will **__definitely_ _**be interested in  
what we have to offer you.  
  
  

You're __tired_ _of blindly spending money for leads and not having  
any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.  Sometimes  
calling 100 people **without one single signup!**   Sometimes  
talking to people who have been **bombarded** by bizop pitches  
to the point of them _hanging up_ when you call!  (Leads oversold)  
  
We're here to help!  
  
We'll get you __qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.__  
  
**Period.**  
  
No qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense.  
  
We'll do it __quickly,__ and __professionally__.  
  
_And we won't ask you for a _single dime_ without **guaranteeing** _results_!  
  
  
_**_Here's How We Generate Our Leads...  
  
_**- **All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!  
  
**\- One source we use for Lead-generation is a **Business Opportunity  
Seeker Lead List** of people who have requested info. about making  
extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,  
or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.  
  
\- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.  
We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,  
plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in  
making money from home.  If they are, the system records their  
name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.  
  
\- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then  
**PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices** and the following  
info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):  
  
**Name:  
Email:  
Phone:  
Best time to call:  
State:  
Reason they want to work from home!:  
How much they want to make per month:  
How much time they can commit per week:  
How much money they have available for startup:  
If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:  
  
We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no  
more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.  
  
**\- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,  
from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.  
  
\- This way, **you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time***  
(only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!  
  
\- We **GUARANTEE** that you'll receive _AT LEAST_ a valid _Name_ ,  
_Phone Number_ and the _Time-Date Stamp_ corresponding to when  
the Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have  
ALL of the information asked above.  
  
  
**Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:  
  
**1\. They will be **Extremely Qualified** due to the nature of the  
qualifying questions that will be asked (above).  
  
2\. They are **Super-Fresh!**   Delivered in Real-Time only **moments  
**after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)  
  
3\. They're **Targeted.**   Each Lead we generate originates from a  
targeted list of business opportunity seekers.  
  
4\. They're **Highly Receptive!**   **Receptivity is very, very high**  
because they **aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching  
them on opportunities!**  Also they'll remember speaking to  
someone over the phone.  Especially since **we tell them to  
expect your call!  
  
**5\. **No ""feast or famine""** activity.  Leads will be coming in  
regularly.  You dictate the flow!  
  
6\. **No more cold calls!   **We tell your prospects you'll be calling.  
  
7\. You can ***personalize* your approach** with the info. you  
get with each Lead!  
  
8\. **Save Time.   **Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.  
  
9\. **Lower ""burnout"" factor.**  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier  
to pick up the phone, day in and day out.  
  
10\. You can **sort your Leads** based on their responses and call the  
hottest ones first.  
  
11\. You can **get new reps started quicker** using these Leads due  
to **higher closing ratios**.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger  
momentum, and skyrockets ""new rep retention"" as a result of  
""quick successes"".  
  
12\. The **Leads will be uniform** \- almost all leads will have the info.  
indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)  
  
13\. They're **double-qualified** because to generate the Lead,  
a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.  
  
14\. Excellent **control of the flow of Leads** coming through.  
  
If you've been trying to run things too long without a _steady flow_ of high  
quality leads, call us __NOW__ to get things in motion.  Just let us know  
what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized  
lead-generation campaign for you.  
  
Since your need to get business moving has probably never been  
more critical than it is today, why not call us **_NOW!  
  
_**These are **__fresh, highly qualified leads__** because these people aren't  
just responding to some ""Generic Business Opportunity"" ad, they're  
contacted **over the phone specifically** for **_YOUR_** company!  And we  
forward you the leads within **_minutes_** of the lead being generated - not  
days, weeks, or months!  
  
  

Start Generating As Many **SIGN-UPS** as You Can Handle!  
Explode Your Downline and Income!

The first part of their proposal, which = would limit backup copies, has drawn objections from academics = and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it. Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio seg= ment generally may ""sell or otherwise dispose of"" that analog recording or = digital file as they wish. The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substa= ntial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a cons= umer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as ""fair use."" Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge sa= id that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copy= right lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popula= r Kazaa software. The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Associ= ation of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies = in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Net= works, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally= created the Kazaa software. However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sha= rman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in th= e South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permis= sion to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week th= at Sharman could be added to the lawsuit. **Shoring up U.S. security**   Computer security is becoming increasingly critical to Presiden= t Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally pro= posed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-call= ed cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting abou= t tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the Unite= d States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked comm= ittees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end = of the week. Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Inte= rnet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protectio= n functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assuran= ce Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of St= andards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center. Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own priv= acy czar. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that = the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure= that new technologies ""sustain and do not erode"" privacy protections and t= o verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guideli= nes. **Who's running your computer?**   Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going o= n now with their computers. Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers piggyback malicious cod= e on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service. According to= the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full i= nstructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacke= r to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X. The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating me= chanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. Acco= rding to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature do= wnloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a = system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem. Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applica= tions may be vulnerable to a recently discovered software flaw = that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages o= r in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company = PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail co= uld carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, = read their documents and execute programs on their computer. Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets user= s encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye = Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associ= ates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerab= ility in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a vic= tim's computer. **Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyone** One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi= wireless networking technology has made its debut. IQinVision = plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to p= ut video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly ins= tall a temporary security system. This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and = wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standar= d. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital = cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camer= a maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is also invading handheld devices. Wireless equipment mak= er Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networki= ng technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The car= d, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth qua= rter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities = to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other c= ompanies. Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and o= wners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless ca= pabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the= card, wireless access becomes an option for many. Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networ= king. Broadband providers are cracking down on some customers, = threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless sys= tems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access. After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi ""hot spo= ts"" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at lea= st 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber = can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the N= et, for fun or for profit. **News.com special focus: China**   As China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is= becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products. And as the gl= obal recession leaves few fertile opportunities elsewhere, China has emerge= d as a primary target for foreign business. A News.com three-part special report examines the various reasons that this may eventually b= e known as China's high-tech century. **Also of note**   Apple Computer plans to serve up a new iMac model with a larger fla= t-panel display during next week's Macworld Expo trade show...Microsoft= joined the growing customer relationship management market by prev= iewing its first CRM product...America Online has quietly been testing an update to its popular AOL Instant Messenger, using graphics= to create personal looks reminiscent of Yahoo's chat features...Federal re= gulators deactivated hundreds of thousands of credit cards belo= nging to former customers of NextCard...IBM's hard drive business, which th= e company is selling to Hitachi, lost $515 million in the five = most recent quarters...Yahoo reported its first profit in six q= uarters but found it difficult to assuage analysts' concerns about its core= advertising business. _Want more?

My question for the trust system is this. I signed up for a free account 
on some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of data, 
and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The mailing 
includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few 
links to their book store.

This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, 
and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them might 
be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even 
includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the 
next mail is still flagged as spam.

Who is losing a trust rating here? If it is not unsolicited commercial e-
mail, it should not be reported by Razor as spam -- correct?

adds up to the value lost.  And the non-pecuiary since of violation,
loss, and trouble has to get in there somewhere if we are really picky.

I don't think considering marginal utility of dollars has value in this
situation.  We aren't debating whether the thief is better off -- he is.

I'm not a lawyer either.  I played one on TV once but I didn't play a
very good one and they canceled it after the first episode ...

The situtation I described came from my recollection of Epstein's
'Takings'.  He was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property
right found in Liberation theology and was using the idea -- that in an
emergency where my life depends upon it I'm entitled to violate your
property rights and (more) you are forbidden from using unreasonable
force to defend them (particularly if you aren't around).

Maybe I did get it all wrong, but that particular recollection is
relatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my
libertarian theology needed to be modified.

He was also analyzing what the common law had come up with, which might
not be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction.

I hope they aren't intending to release a new RH with a new gcc which hasn't yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and I'm sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment. FWIW, I've yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide - apt's C++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are, and in addition doesn't use namespaces at all. For non-C++ folk, this basically means it needs porting. I've got a reasonable way along, now, and I'll send a suitable patch to Connectiva or somewhere when I succeed - I can't find anything on Connectiva's site itself for this. In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really started on this, but it's mainly just arguments added. The rpmlib documentation seems somewhat poor, though, unless I've missed it.

 It's August, and big cats are on the prowl
 By Alan Hamilton
 
 
 
 ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British
 countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,
 vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,
 including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair
 samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its
 undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. 
 
 Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,
 founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has
 received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. 
 
 During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat
 activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from
 the public has been fantastic, Mr Bamping said. Big cats in Britain are
 real. They are out there, they are breeding; theres more of them. 
 
 Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark
 Fraser, who heads the societys Scottish arm, said: Lynx are now present in
 the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I dont
 want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several
 hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders. 
 
 Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which
 includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as
 well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in
 Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand
 was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black
 hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. 
 
 The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of
 trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the
 beasts, which it will then present to the Government. 
 
 It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.
 Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. 
 
 Next in August: record abductions by aliens.

 It is to complex. Look at the mess that is gentoo. Just because you can

Reg Clemens <reg@dwf.com>,exmh-users@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 18 Sep 2002 20:41:34 -0600",(PGP problem) EXMH hangs during 'Query keyserver',"I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some
updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?

My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
get a button that reads:
	""Check the signature with GnuPG""
If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
along with a button with the inscription
	""Query keyserver""
If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.

If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.

Anyone else with this problem?
This is EXMH v2.5 and tcl/tk 8.4a4

2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort

Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long.""
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
on 08705 555 999.

Well, with 7.0, I've seen a few problems with doing that, but as of 7.2 it's really wonderful! Ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh related packages while being connected through ssh?

It would?
Sounds like you are talking about setting up a company, to be a vendor....
I'd venture the early days of Debian, Slackware and other involveds there
was no such financing.

Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 


The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!

Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.

Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.

==========

I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)

==>

The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
under Lorenzo the Magnificent?
 

--------------

De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.

[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that
is the envy of most of the world.

Yeah, I get that. I just think this is a poor
example. Corporate bankruptcy is a power fight
between creditors, management, and shareholders
over control of assets. Because a corporation is
incorporeal (hee, hee), it can't be much else.

If you're concerned about the imbalance of power
related to corporations, I think the more relevant
areas are tax structures, especially the income
tax, various forms of externality, law related to
employment, corporate transparency, and corporate
governance.

Triple-digit Dow gains at 2PM...),"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 A bull market climbs a wall of worry -- on record volume. Yeah, I know, it's different this time. Pay no attention to the bear behind the curtain, and all that. However, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that long ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring regularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered of Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and Henry ""Dr. Doom"" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might* come down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE volume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred mill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something *billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing, key-punching ""administration"" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago, chief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody at Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally and wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said it wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too late, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the market came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what, 1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting... A 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's 40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but that's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a pressurized cabin to breathe in. So, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively speaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to realize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for a house, tulips are still nice things to have around. Hint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any time soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started CEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably not resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The threat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive decompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you will. So, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real one we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for people to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while there's blood in the streets. As to whether the accounting is ""rigged"", remember what Robert Heinlein said: ""Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you don't play."" Cheers, RAH The aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an actual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school and talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to boot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it sometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's a bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look behind the curtain, right? :-). - --- begin forwarded text From: Somebody Else To: ""R.

A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?


http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html


Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.

Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.

Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.

The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.

He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.

""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""

The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.

His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.

She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.""

Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
that morning.

He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.""

Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.

If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.

>Mail Me the Money!
>By David Friedman 08/08/2002

David is a very bright fellow. But this time he's
several years behind. The idea of using epostage
to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The
problem is how to get over the adoption hump.
Until most people are taking one form of epostage,
most people don't have enough incentive to download
and install something that allows them to pay it.
Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of
epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown
senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even
from known senders. Giving someone my email address
doesn't automatically put them in my white list.

Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by
removing the need to pay money for epostage.
Instead, the sender burns processing time on his
computer, answering a cryptographically hard
challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is
inadequate incentive to do so until there is a
standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is
born until a significant fraction of the market
has taken that first step. It may take government
action, to institute an effective epostage
standard!

I think the better idea is to require that people
off your white list ""hand sign"" email to you. A
couple of companies are now trying to implement
this. An email sender, if not on your white list,
must respond to a verification email or go to a
website, by a process that is very simply for a
human sender, but difficult for a spammer to
automate. Where epostage requires a standard
mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for ""hand
signing"" would frustrate spammers while making it
no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm
hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail
clients incorporate this kind of feature. The
advantage to putting this in the mail client is
that the required ""hand sign"" can be personalized:

  ""Your attempt to email David Friedman is
  blocked until you fill in the blank: The
  Incredible ______ Machine.""

It will be a long time before spammers have a
process that defeats millions of personal
challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in
mind that would work a large percentage of the
time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure
out such hacks, people would then improve their
challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another
arms race, and spam would leak through to the
unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps
spammers identify and target the part of the
population whose challenges are sub-par, which
is their natural prey. People like David aren't
in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley
debt consolidation.

Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he
didn't point out that spam is the result of
government. The government is ineffective at
preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals
and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.

To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once the %files error was corrected : rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit  This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course, you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_ produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able to finish successfully. Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-) It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables during install, when the simple cases like ""%makeinstall"" or ""make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}"" don't work.

Assalam Aleikum,

I wish to seek your assistance in a matter that needs trust secrecy and
confidentiality.

I am A. B. Sanni, a close confidant to Mohammed Abacha, son of late
General Sani Abacha, former head of state Federal Republic of Nigeria, who
ruled from November 17th 1993 to June 8th 1998 when he died suddenly in
office.

Since then, the family as a whole has been facing all sorts of
harassments, by security operatives/agents of the new Head of State
(General Obasanjo) who served a jail term under my friend's father for
coup offence. Even my friend's old mother has been detained and tortured
many times.  Mohammed is now being charged for military decision of his
father's regime e.g. the murder cases of political opponents. These
offences he knows nothing about, as he was only the Head of State's son,
not even a military man nor was he in the government. 

His father ruled for five years during which period he acquired financial
gains and property all over the world from his share of Crude Oil Sales as
the Head of State. Now, the family has lost all assets (property and money
in Nigeria) to the new government. Ref. News Watch Magazine publication of
11th to 18th October, 1999. However, they have hidden records in a secret
name with the Nigerian Insurance Deposit Corporation to access a coded
trust accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million
United States Dollars only ($338,000,000).   Mohammed is currently being
detained and tortured to sign off accounts of his late father and he has
done that but not the coded trust accounts in the name of certain
government multinational contractors that I can not disclose now.

THE AIM OF THIS LETTER IS TO REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE TO SECURE THIS
ACCOUNT IN A SAFE/CONFIDENTIAL BANK AND HELP INVEST THE MONEY FOR OUR
MUTUAL BENEFIT. We also expect to use some of our share of the money to
relocate ourselves to another safe Country because right now Nigeria is
not safe and we will like to go into hiding overseas if we can escape.

If you are interested in helping secure the accounts please contact me
immediately by email ""a_sanni@email.com"", so that we can arrange an
initial meeting in a neighboring country, thus you can present your
investment program and projects for our assessment.  Thereafter we will
sign an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) binding this business
relationship and immediately entrust you to access the coded trust
accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million United
States Dollars only ($338,000,000).

We will depend on your business experience to make sure that we get
maximum returns on our investment with you.

PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING THE CODED TRUST ACCOUNT YOU
ARE LIKELY TO INCURE EXPENSES BUT IT WILL BE PAID BACK ONCE WE SECURE THE
DEPOSIT.  IT IS 100% SAFE FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. 
Just forward via email your full name, phone number, fax number and bank
details as the new beneficiary to enable us make formal application for
the transfer of ownership to you.

We look forward to your helping us, but if you are not interested kindly
discard this letter and still maintain its confidentiality.

Ma-Salam.

Well, you're lucky if it sometimes works for you.  Mine hang all the  time, have to kill 'em with -9.  And after that, rpm doesn't work at all  (hangs right after i run the command, prints nothing).

akitogo is happy to announce that Jochen Becker has just finished a small
nice PHP interface which integrates Spammassassin in the webuser interface
from Communigate.

It currently tested with RedHat,PHP and CGPro

What is does:
-------------
The users are able to:
- edit the blacklist and whitelist
- edit required hits (score)
- define a mailbox in which every spam mail is dropped

Spamassassin settings made by the webinterfaxe are handled domain wide.

You can download it from:

Enjoy,

My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered ""with all faults"", so
at least they are honest).

mh used them nicely.  mh stores one message per file.  the refile command
allows you to move a message from one folder to another *or* link it to
another folder.  it uses hard links to do this.  this would suck to if
it used soft links - what if i later deleted the actual file?

Besides lists, this is the reason I can't use such a system. I get more
than a few mails from 'dont-respond-to-this-address@' password reminder
generators, for example. SpamAssassin does flag a few of those as spam,
but at least I've still got them.

I had just finished giving Ben and his sister a ""behind the scenes"" look at
our set, when Patrick walked in and poked me in the left arm repeatedly with
his index finger - until I hung up the phone and gave him my full, undivided
attention. ""Did you know that your GnomeTomes are being featured in the
'Barnes & Noble' eBooks section,"" he asked. Well, that was news to me. After
flailing over to his workstation and flipping through a few pages, we
ultimately realized that he had discovered the entry on the main page for
Amazon's eBooks. Cool! ""With a name that inspires curiosity and sparks the
imagination, Lockergnome represents one of the latest and most popular
additions to our e-documents catalog. At prices starting under $3, these
eminently useful titles from one of the most fanciful-sounding publishers
we've encountered are hard to resist."" Thank you for helping us along, gang.
My ultimate goal is to kick that Godin guy out of the top ten - if only for a
day.

I must now thank both Lockergnomie Dan Reain and Nancy Workman-Luter (both
from Sonic Foundry) for donating a couple more prizes for this year's Gnomedex
conference. Just by walking through the entrance with your pass in hand,
you'll be automatically entered to win one of the copies of Sound Forge XP!
And this software is no slouch; for home users and professionals on a Windows
OS, it's one of the best audio editors around. If it can't do something you
need to have done, then I bet it can't be done at all. Expect a full
Lockergnome review from our Digital Media editor (Jake) at some point in the
future. Until then, feel free to download the demo. If I can ever decide on a
digital video camera, perhaps their Vegas Video will sit on my system, too.
Melanie and I were talking about hardware options the other day. She's leaning
towards a Canon, too. Unless I hear or see otherwise, the ZR45MC is at the top
of my list. Still and low-light images aren't the best, but I'm not really up
for spending much more than $1000. Neither is Gretchen, oddly enough.

As much as I dislike the AOL client user interface, I gotta admit: it's pretty
darn powerful underneath. For instance, you can ""unsend"" an e-mail message
(but only if it was sent to another America Online member and s/he hasn't read
it yet). If you travel often, the service is a bargain. If you know someone
who just needs the Internet basics, it's perfect. One caveat: the software
puts RealPlayer on your system without asking you first. I was a little upset
when I discovered its icon sitting in my Start Menu. Nowhere during the
installation process did I see a way to opt out of it. I'm not surprised;
there are more advertisements on AOL than there are from your average ""free""
Web page host. You may have asked yourself: ""What is Chris doing installing
AOL in the first place?!"" I don't blame you. No, hell did not freeze over.
We've been doing tips for their users on our show lately, and I decided to
throw it on my laptop for testing purposes. Perhaps 8.0 will be better?

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

**SEPopular v1.02 [2.4M] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://www.monocle-solutions.com/sepopular/sepopular.shtml

{Popularity contest} I never considered myself to be part of the popular
crowd. But how do you really know if others consider you to be popular? Well,
if you are talking about the popularity of your website (although the junior
high kids are more concerned about the labels on your clothes), then all you
have to do is download SEPopular. Search engines (such as Google) rank your
site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who
link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you
can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five
major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website,
though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the
TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you
can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each
one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.

  
**MB-Ruler v0.93 [441k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://www.markus-bader.de/MB-Ruler/

{Measure distance and angles} I was never very good in geometry... Pythagoras
would be disappointed that I can never exactly remember his theorem. (What did
a hippopotamus have to do with triangles anyway? That animal seems to be
pretty round if you ask me...) Anyway, MB-Ruler is quite a useful little
application, especially for anyone who has had to work with banners and
graphics for the Web. You can measure angles in radians or degrees, and
distances in inches, centimeters, twips, points or pixels. And if those
weren't enough options, you can even set your own scale. Everything about MB-
Ruler can be customized, including its size and color. Talk about an
application that ""measures up!""

{Fixing password problems} Now where did I put that password? I thought I had

Windows 2000 or Windows XP) to check your e-mail, then this article is for
you. Occasionally your password for Outlook Express is not retained, even
though you have checked the ""Remember Password"" checkbox. To fix this
particular issue, you will need Administrator privileges in order to make some
modifications to your system's registry. The article contains steps for
backing up your registry and, since you can cause a lot of accidental damage
while tweaking the registry... I would recommend that you follow them.

**Re-route E-mail Forwarding Service**

http://www.re-route.com/

Soon, it will be time for us to fill out the change of address cards as we
relocate to a different area of the city. You probably knew that your snail
mail could be forwarded, but what about your e-mail? Back in the days of
college e-mail accounts, every time I changed ISPs I had to send a mass e-mail
to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise I could miss out
on getting their correspondence. The great thing about Re-Route's service is
that I don't have to worry about lost e-mails after changing ISPs. Sign up for
the service, and they will take any e-mail sent to your old account and
forward it to your new e-mail address. After that, Re-Route e-mails the sender
to notify them of your new address. If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their
featured partners, then the first month is free. If not, then Re-Route charges
a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twenty-five bucks for 3
months. Have someone else handle all my changing e-mail address need! s?
Sounds like money well spent!

 GnomeTIP  
  
---  
  
Just because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop
using your flash on your digital camera. Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows
that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can
only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow?
Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to
throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how
much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can
adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first.
Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add
depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your
desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve
battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and
turning off the LCD display.

instead of only 5,000 each).

=A0
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mai=

response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
=A0
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail =
sent out. The=20
0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000=

As you know, prior to placing the products into maintenance mode, we were actively looking for a buyer that would continue the development and support of the technology. Network Associates has retained products developed using PGPsdk including McAfee E-Business Server for encrypted server-to-server file transfer, McAfee Desktop Firewall and McAfee VPN Client. These products will remain a part of Network Associates existing product portfolio and we will continue to develop them to meet your security needs. PGP Corporation has acquired PGPmail, PGPfile, PGPdisk, PGPwireless, PGPadmin and PGPkeyserver encryption software products for Win32 and Macintosh, PGPsdk encryption software development kit, and PGP Corporate Desktop for Macintosh. In addition to the technology, PGP Corporation has acquired all worldwide customer license agreements and technical support obligations. To ensure a seamless transition, Network Associates will work with PGP Corporation to support PGP customers through October 26, 2002. PGP Corporation will contact you shortly with details on its plans and product direction. We trust that you will have continued success with the PGP desktop and wireless encryption products through PGP Corporation. Network Associates appreciates your business and we value our continued relationship across our remaining product lines.

I don't go to many concerts, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate
listening to good music at every waking moment. Tonight, a handful of Bay
Gnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore. Melanie, Steve,
Brent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and Mindy had a total blast.
Well, it wasn't much fun when Robert got his digital camera confiscated - but
this was a show worthy of five megapixels (believe me)! Brent went to the show
last night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this afternoon. They were
selling a new CD (which had JUST been released the other day); ""They Got Lost""
is full of a few previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about
purchasing it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial EMusic
account and download a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the
opening act: Noe Venable. She's got a few free MP3s on her site, too. Give
""Boots"" a shot - very nice.

Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me as a gift
(which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the manual - but the ones
and zeros start to look eerily similar after flipping past the first page. You
know me: I'm not much of a math guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day
that 'byte' was short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece, but it just
isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that? I'm ready to walk on the
wild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've
been known to do nutty things on a moment's notice, like changing my default
Web browser. Courtesy of Asa Dotzler, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD,
and t-shirt (which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too
jealous; Mozilla.org has plenty of goodies to go around.

Looks as though Jake and Lori are already having a blast in St. Louis. They're
at the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds of well-known
program programmers - the people who make our computers work the way we want
them to work! We're doing our best to convince them to join us at Gnomedex.
They ask: ""Who else is going to be there?"" We answer: ""People who don't know
you yet."" They ask: ""Then why should I come?"" We answer: ""Because it's a
business opportunity for you."" They ask: ""What if I don't want to learn
anything or meet anybody?"" We answer: ""We can't really help you there, but
here - have lunch on us."" They ask: ""Oh, the admission price includes food at
at Gnomedex?"" We answer: ""We cannot provide every meal, but you won't go
hungry."" They ask: ""So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there."" We
answer: ""You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex."" Get
it? Got it? Good.

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

**GigAlarm v1.201 [33k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://users.bigpond.net.au/glina/GigAlarm.htm

{String on your finger} Sometimes, I'm a bit like the absent-minded
professor... I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I
appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can
setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text
message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of
GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a
WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program,
or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the
habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too
long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The
author says, ""This program is essentially free to use for non-profit
purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5
USD) as a token of your appreciation.""

  
**Context Thumbview v1.0.b1 [107k] W9x/2K/XP FREE**

http://contextmagic.netfirms.com/image-viewer/

{Peep show} I'm not always very patient, especially when it comes to my
computer. Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my
image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context
Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view
an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose ""View Thumbnail,"" and
there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open
up any programs! ""As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always
ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window,
including Open and Save As... dialog boxes."" As an added bonus, with Context
Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I
want to save system resources.

**Starter v5.5.4.2175 [423k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://codestuff.tripod.com/

{Startup manager} This application bills itself as ""Yet Another Startup
Manager""... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's
a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task
Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from
where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it
also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and
export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over
your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when
you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.

**Aversoft Sticker v3.55 [592k] W9x/2k/XP US$15**  
Unearthed by Sergei Lepyokhin

http://www.aversoft.com/sticker/

{Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident? I
use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a
whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember ""important
information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop."" No
more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of
paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no
accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only
half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other
programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your
notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating
or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook.

information tool with an undocumented topic. Know what you're looking for?
Then just use the search tool. In the mood to fill your cranium with a few new
thought processes? Just browse through any one of Wikipedia's many categories
until you find a subject that piques your interest. From Physics to Opera;
from Anthropology to Cooking, you will find it all here. Now, all that is

 GnomeTIP  
  
---  
  
Gnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no
exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: ""Did you know that you can
copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?"" Alex also
had this to say: ""When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a
new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from
the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse
button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right
mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text
(along with several other options)."" Those are some great time saving tips
Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X
to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then
just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the
right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving
yourself some time.

QUESTIONS:  From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com  Subject: Using pictures as links  I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages.  But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the  pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.   How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages  without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with  actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my  favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days.  Mark  moviebuff@cliffhanger.com  ANSWERS: From: Zaak  - Zaako@linkpaks.com  Subject: Access using a proxy  >From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com)  >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422)  --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is  blocking 50% of  the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by  using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is  there a way to get access to these sites? --  A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself.  I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then  from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that  block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money  with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and  because they allow me to surf anonymously!  I have a detailed right-up on them at  http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php  See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

SITES TO REVIEW: Site #124: http://www.BestWayToShop.com Dale Pike  rhinopez@aol.com    Site #125: http://www.wedeliverparties.com Dawn Clemons  dclemons7@home.com  Site #126: http://www.EClassifiedshq.com  Carol Cohen  Opp0rtunity@aol.com  SITE REVIEWED: Comments on Site #123: http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html Dennis  damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~ I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and  I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third  paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as  shown on the page. I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should  be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered  on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.   As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person  doing the page is always good.  We need some information about  why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to.  ~~~~ Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations  for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to  'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading  for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like  you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you  to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend  look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like  before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you  their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know  they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter.  It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your  newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or  an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that  page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~ I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text.  I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read  quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily.  I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds  site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted.  A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~ This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the  message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is  personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted  to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see  a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word  missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be  smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers* ~~~~ Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also  are errors in the following paragraphs :  ""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement,  send your to my email"" ~~~~ A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's  newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be  a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to  have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably  didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be  better served if he at least put some of the things out there for  all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to  subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~ What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful  resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy  advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter  with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com)  asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad.  He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get  from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about  the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40  points size which gets difficult to read.  ~~~~ A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on  the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its  just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an  advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough  move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter  itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of  ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably  you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting  the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue,  a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click  for more info on your free ads.  ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!

QUESTIONS:  From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com  Subject: Using pictures as links  I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages.  But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the  pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.   How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages  without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with  actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my  favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days.  Mark  moviebuff@cliffhanger.com  ANSWERS: From: Zaak  - Zaako@linkpaks.com  Subject: Access using a proxy  >From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com)  >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422)  --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is  blocking 50% of  the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by  using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is  there a way to get access to these sites? --  A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself.  I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then  from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that  block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money  with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and  because they allow me to surf anonymously!  I have a detailed right-up on them at  http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php  See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

(Issue #422)  CJ,  Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are:  http://www.anonymise.com and http://www.anonymizer.com .  However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work.  Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or  may not visit, then it is time to change providers!

""MIAMI, Sept. 10 -- A two-gram rock of crack
cocaine was found inside the shoe of Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush's 25-year-old daughter by workers
at the central Florida rehabilitation center

Noelle Bush was not arrested because witnesses
would not give sworn statements, but the

Orlando police spokesman Orlando Rolon.""

Wow, the witnesses would not nark of a Bush girl in an era where there are
no mare restrictions on being held without a cause?

So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-) Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )   Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down. When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even _better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change my mind on the multiple email address thing.

I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only fork.

 Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
 
 ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks.""
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
 
 One or two potential emigrs might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself"".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens.""
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

    Wright believes the beating happened for one of two reasons. ""The little

Why? When it comes down to the assembly level, it gets turned
into some kind of jump instruction. Should I pretend I don't know
this when I'm programming?

It's not mandatory. You can leave out the break, and the flow
of control will continue to the next case. Which can be useful
in certain circumstances.

Errrr....the biz guys in my office don't care what the ""WISPs"" want to do with their little WiFi networks.  And the bandwidth shadows in most cities are surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, which is pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit considerations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless is tied into fiber at multiple points. The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to well over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and proximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers can remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective bandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company's long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to keep things sane. Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling, especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more efficient). -James Rogers  jamesr@best.com",0,0

I decided to upgrade the kernel on a machine at home from 2.2.18pre21 to the latest from kernel.org which is 2.4.19.

However I have encountered one problem, my network card now dosent work, well kind of dosent work...

Instead of one eth0 on IRQ 10 I now get:
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x220, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a 3e 0e 48, IRQ 5.

Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html

This results in the interface(s) coming up but while packets can go out they can not come in.

I've tried not loading the 3c509 mdule on bootup and then `modload 3c509 IRQ=10` bit it still gets loaded as above, on IRQ 5 and 10. On 2.2 it loads to IRQ 10.

Anyone got any suggestions on what to do here? Its a debian 3.0 distro. This works fine when booted to 2.2 so the hardware/BIOS etc seem ok, so it seems to be 2.4 spacific. Have I missed some kernel setting?

James Rogers <jamesr@best.com>,Jim Whitehead <ejw@cse.ucsc.edu>,23 Sep 2002 13:36:10 -0700,RE: Goodbye Global Warming,"""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, is
highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological
timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.

My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the
supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute
terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise
floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last
50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate
of temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of global
temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree
here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global
temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore 
immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why
temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last
couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological
standards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use
climate to push a particular social agenda.

It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited
during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of
humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers
paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a
bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried
in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the
ice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to ""save
the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their
existence has always been transient.

For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are
anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll
just stick with Occam's Razor for now.

In my humble opinion.

Cheers,

Yup, tagging data is mondo tedious, and mistakes hurt.

I expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand
grepping.  Be sure to stare at the false positives and get the spam out of

With probabilities favoring ham or spam?  A skip token is produced in lieu

Puts 127.0.0.1 as the IP for adservers. Elegant. == http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hostfile.html As mentioned throughout this site, there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to pop-ups. The hosts file is one of the most effective methods there is. In brief, a hosts file is a text file used by Windows to resolve domain names and IP addresses. If you're running windows, you already have a hosts file but it most likely isn't being used. What a hosts file does is simple, it lists domains and IP numbers. To get rid of ads, the hosts file lists the domain names of adservers along with the IP number 127.0.0.1. This tells windows to grab any content from the listed domain from the specified IP number. The specified IP number in this case is your own computer. What happens is that it won't display the ad. If you choose this method of ad removal there is no need to use our opt out links. The hosts file is a very effective mechanism. You can download this hosts file, unzip it and place it in your Windows directory. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BACK UP of your existing hosts file before you do. The hosts file is called ""hosts"" there is no extension. You may have a file named Hosts.sam this is merely a sample hosts file. Once you download the file and put it in the windows folder, reboot your computer and it's a done deal. Pretty simple huh? You might want to look at the contents of this file as it contains additional information as well as an address for getting updated versions.

I see no reason why both approaches could and should not be used.
MTA level filtering would just need to use a different corpus, one that 
would contain illegal or otherwise commonly unapproved material for the 
group of people using that MTA.   I'm sure that such an approach would 
significantly reduce the mail traffic as a first step, without  giving  
false positives.

MUA corpus would then be personally trained -- although I'd like the 
option of 'down-loadable' corpuses and merge functionality.

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that
software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

So it sounds as if, to your thinking,
most useful apps are also trivial. 
Unless each key on my keyboard were
(to the apps) distinct event sources,
I can't think of any of my usual job
mix that would need hundreds, or even
tens, of async requests; perhaps you
can explain how nontrivial apps will
be compellingly useful?

Does that lack of portability imply it
isn't generally useful?  (When it was
apparent that TCP networks were useful,
berkeley sockets could be found even
on VMS and Win 3.1 boxen)

Why would early Unix have run with the
idea that, if one wishes to do multiple
things at the same time, one can use a
group of processes to do them?

- they had Multics as a counterexample?

- in the days of tiny memories and tapes,
  people were more accustomed to writing
  programs that didn't run entirely in a
  single address space?

- one is a great number for an interface,
  as log(1) is 0, and specification can
  be implicit?

- some combination of the above?

Now, as Hoare says:

As programmers, we've been able to make
our lives complicated for at least half
a century; the hardware interrupt gives
us the rope.

Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE
was the counterexample of IBM's multi-
programmed boxes (were these the same
ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)
and I suppose he would say the question
is how not to make a mess of it -- how
should we structure computations so if
we try to do ten times as many things
at the same time, reasoning about the
resulting system is at most ten times
more complex -- not one hundred, and
certainly not three and a half million
times more.

Compared to that project, the prospect
of writing a driver library for various
vendors' aio implementations seems to
be truly trivial.

Again, this is not true. Only certain events (reports/revokes) for a spam
are rewarded and the algorithm for picking these up is based on many
different factors.

Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing
and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down
when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT
disenfranchised. They
get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is
more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these
people.

And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid
tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such
clueless social morons that they don't see this or are they just interested
in stroking their pathetic egos?

OBTW, 'clueless social moron syndrom' does not have political boundaries.

I note that: 1) It's one of those Makefile.PL things. 2) While I know that Makefiles generated by a ./configure generated in turn by a later version of auto* do support the technique you're trying, I know nothing about what the Perl MakeMaker (or whatever it is) supports. The general solution for cases like this is to install manually (Try make -n and see what it does). I think that Perl's installer system might support an installation root, though I've blissfully no idea how to operate it. I suggest finding a small Perl module SRPM and looking at the spec file to see how RedHat (or Turbo, or PLD, although RedHat generally know *all* the tricks) do it.

My laptop has a Via C3 processor. I use Debian with a self-compiled
2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolutely no problems with the chip at all
(quite the opposite, in fact).

I had to compile for ""686"" in order for 3D acceleration to work (the
kernel has an option specifically for the Via C3), but I assume that was
a kernel problem rather than a hardware problem.

CNET Reviews  
|  |  **Dear readers,**  
The majority of PC users may run Windows, but Microsoft can't touch the
passion that Mac users bring to computing. This week, Apple devotees gathered
in New York to find out what their guru, Steve Jobs, has in store for them.
They were not disappointed, with offerings ranging from the new iMacs, which
continue to push the boundaries of the PC form factor, to updated iPods that
include more memory, better menus, and compatibility with Windows. Read the
full coverage from CNET's News.com.

Whatever happened to the straightforward, dedicated PIM? PIM/contact managers,
such as the ubiquitous Outlook and Lotus, pushed them to the sidelines. But a
few PIMs survived this enforced obscurity. If you need a plain PIM that
doesn't cost a fortune, one of these may tickle your fancy. More software

Peer-to-peer pioneer dies, Macworld kicks off in Manhattan, and the
PayPal/eBay merger is not going so well.  
_\--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends_

**1** | **Gene Kan:**  
Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June 29 in an apparent
suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET community. Last week, search requests
for information on 25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the peer-to-peer space,
many credit him with legitimizing file sharing--making it about more than
music, according to Wired News.  
---|---  
**2** | **Macworld:**  
The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a good show, whether or not
Steve Jobs has anything real to announce. So far, it looks like Apple has
already surprised a few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No.
7), which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing quagmire.  
**3** | **PayPal:**  
It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and PayPal deal. Soon after eBay
announced it was buying PayPal for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit
claiming that PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its involvement with
online gambling transactions.  
**4** | **Wi-Fi:**  
I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up on the Buzz Meter
permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting interest because of a possible pact
between tech heavyweights, including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon
Communications, to build wireless access places across the nation in public
areas where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as airports.  
**5** | **eMac:**  
This is the for-education-only computer that consumers wanted so badly that
Apple released it to them. The CNET review is out, and here's the word: the
eMac is what the iMac used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly
inexpensive computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
processing and accessing the Web.

John Beck <jbeck@eng.sun.com>,exmh-users@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 09 Oct 2002 11:42:49 -0700",Re: From,"James> This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail,
James> Solaris and mh.

Correct.

James> Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail
James> server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn
James> on that facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to
James> cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more
James> stupid decision to rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with
James> this problem.  Since mh is unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags
James> trying to parse messages from the spool.

Also correct.  In fairness, though I cannot defend the Content-Length: header
as I consider it brain damage in the extreme, Sun inherited this from AT&T.

James> Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.
James> This means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "". Any such
James> line will look like "">From "".

Specifically, you will need to find a line in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf that
starts with ""Mlocal"" such as:

[4784] grep ^Mlocal /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
Mlocal,         P=/usr/lib/mail.local, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qPSXfmnz9E, S=EnvFromSMTP/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
[4785] 

and make sure that 'E' appears in the long list of flags following ""F="".
If your sys-admin uses m4 to generate sendmail.cf, and any good sys-admin
should, then here is the magic line for the .mc file:

MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+E')dnl

James> You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
James> letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids
James> the whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time,
James> and everything works.

Also correct, though procmail per se is not needed, as other filters (such
as slocal, which is part of the [n]mh distribution) do the trick just as well.

-- John

Siva Doriaswamy <siva@SandCraft.com>,exmh-users@spamassassin.taint.org,"Thu, 05 Sep 2002 14:40:53 -0700",Changed location of incoming mail. exmh not working!!,"I use exmh 2.5 with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to
the relevant folder using rcvstore.

Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept
mail from the new location.

There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the
top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-)
That does not make a difference.

It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from
my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need to
configure that probably.

Any idea how I would do this?

Thanks

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday when it refused to
boot completely. I borrowed a data vac from a friend and decided to clean all
of the dust and cat hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything,
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where there is a POST
progress bar, but would not proceed past past about the first 1/5th of the
bar. Uh-oh. What did I fry?

As it turns out, it was another case of ""always check the small stuff"". Oh, I
had all of the cables plugged back in to the server properly, I checked all of
that, but it didn't dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later
that I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the cables. That
server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM switch and with all of the
yanking, plucking and shuffling, the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the
switch just a tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning message
like every other computer on the planet, I can only attribute to the BIOS
developers. Server Satchel, running Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it
was previously. The penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How
appropriate...

**ATI Still Makes Video Cards?**

http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656

Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have something to say about
NVIDIA's dominance in the video card market. Seeing as how they've been all
but dumped by the majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from what AnandTech has
to say about the forthcoming R300-based cards, it appears that they haven't
thrown in the towel just yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the
effective re- entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their
driver development has improved as much as their hardware seems to have.

Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a
minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I
wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an
alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of
you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and
the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in
drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized
HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in
their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another
filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript
functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.

**Yer Kidding... Really?**

http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html

I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us that have had to
manage budgets are used to dealing with math in terms of hardware, software,
maintenance and personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of Linux on a server
with less hardware requirements just to do some file sharing, printing and
maybe an Intranet page or three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very
long last, Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to point
out that they have much more to offer than Linux, which may indeed be true.
But at the end of the day, when you compare donuts to donuts and like
functions against one another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, requiring additional
training, suffer the odd blunder here and there, and be less forgiving when it
comes to detailed configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a replacement. Cheap is in
the budget of the beholder.

Recommend It!

There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.
The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human
activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating
after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that
these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for
increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.

Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the
past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming
isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to
understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on
global human activity.

The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.

It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment
subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the
current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2
concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth
should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may
be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I
encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to
eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident
as heat.

Which is to say, if you reduce the argument to absurdity, that law causes 
crime. 

(Yes, I agree that badly written law can make life so frustrating that people 
have little choice but to subvery it if they want to get anything done. This 
is also true of corporate policies, and all other attempts to regulate 
conduct by rules. Rules just don't work well when situations are fluid or 
ambiguous. But I don't think that the misbehavior of energy companies in 
California can properly be called well-intentioned lawbreaking by parties who 
were trying to do the right thing but could do so only by falling afoul of 
some technicality.)

If you want to get to root causes, we should probably go to the slaying of 
Abel by Cain. Perhaps we can figure out what went wrong then, and roll our 
learning forward through history and create a FoRKtopia.

Dear Sir,
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. 
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. 

We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. 

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the
Ministry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man
tender board appointed by the Government of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to
individuals and companies and to approve such contract
payments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The
duties of the committee also include evaluation,
vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign
and local contractors in the ministry.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. 

The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. 

However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. 

The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.

We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service
code of conduct, does not allow us to operate
off-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction is highly needed . 

My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. 

It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not
want to miss this once in a life time opportunity.

You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: 

(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. 

(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. 

(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. 

(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. 

Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. 

Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email
address and I will bring you into the complete picture
of this transaction when I have heard from you. 

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. 

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours faithfully, 

Dr. Osaro Ame

I have a question which is a bit tricky and was
wondering of anyone has come across this problem
before or could point me in the right direction.

I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to
Linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way
semaphores  are being handled. The application uses
mulitple processes to run application code with the
main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o
be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled
via semaphores.

In certain circumstances the main process and the
application child process seem to lock up both waiting
for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I
have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that
the semaphore code is doing the correct things for
syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the
semop() system call.

I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay
between changing semaphore states the problem goes
away, but this causes our entire application to run
really sloooww !! lol

Is there anything weird or different with the standard
implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could
cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state

in a semaphore immediately?

Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==
EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails
(-1) also fixes the problem but again system
performance goes down the toilet.

both the parent controlling process run as the same
uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with
permissions 0666.

Any pointers would be appreciated!

Rgds,

Colin Nevin

**Techs slump with Intel**  
With investors selling Intel shares before its post-market close earnings
announcement, technology stocks dropped Tuesday.

Despite generally upbeat remarks on the economy by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan
and news of a profitable quarter from Nextel Communications, CNET's Tech index
slipped 12.4 points, or 1.25 percent, to 992.91. The tech-laden Nasdaq
composite index fell 7.36 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.26.

Worse-than-expected earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar
helped depress broader markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166.0
points, or 1.92 percent, to 8,473.1--for its seventh consecutive losing
session. The S&P; 500 shed 16.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 900.94--another
multi-year low.

**Microsoft reveals media XP details**  
Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows
XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which
will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs
and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With
Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to
catalog songs, videos and pictures, as well as check TV listings.

**Intel layoffs possible**  
Chipmaker Intel may be on the verge of announcing massive layoffs or other
cuts amid a slow market for personal computers, according to reports. Intel
CEO Craig Barrett is scheduled to speak to employees after stock markets close
Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal. At about the same time, the
chipmaker will discuss its second-quarter results on a conference call with
analysts.  
 **INTEL CORP 18.36 -3.97%**

**Nextel Turns Profitable, Revenues Jump**  
Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's No. 5 wireless telephone company, on
Tuesday said it turned profitable in its second quarter, driven by strong
customer demand that translated to a 25 percent revenue increase. Nextel also
said it expected 2002 operating cash flow of at least $3 billion compared with
an earlier forecast calling for $2.5 billion.

**Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a
""market performer"" rating in tech notes 7/16/02**  
Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is
building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than
traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes
Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply
products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power
supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't
need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large,
untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee
suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely
to rise much in the short term.

You seem to be saying that whitelists are useless, because there are worms
which can compromise your system, read your address book/whitelist, and
sent themselves on, compromising a nonnegligible fraction of systems as
they go along. 

While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don't think this is
true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as
vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken
default settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes
for very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and 
stop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure 
alternatives, whatever comes first).

James,
Last week, when indexing stuff for WhoisIreland.com, I noticed that
ns0.domainregistry.ie and banba.domainregistry.ie were out of synch by a
few days. The other nameservers seemed to give a current SOA at that
time. However the affected secondaries may have been using
ns0.domainregistry.ie for axfr and propagated the error.

This whole thing does seriously bring into question IEDR's decision to
outsource the technical admininstration of .ie to a company that
apparently does not even admin its own DNS.  It is a nice story though -
almost as good as the time that .ie disappeared for 8 hours in July
1998.

I did that.  It's still really slow when you have thousands of messages.

I hadn't tried that.  I figured it was better to find out if ""all but
one"" testing had any appreciable value.  It looks like it doesn't so
I'll forget about it.

Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning
of the message.  In pratice that would probably work fine.

it did in the boom year of 1999.""  Oookaaaay...

Iconoclast designers choose MIPS
By Anthony Cataldo
May 28, 2002  

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A group of engineers in Calabasas Hills, CA wants to
turn the microprocessor world on its head by doing the unthinkable:
tossing out the clock and letting the signals move about unencumbered.
For those designers, inspired by research conducted at nearby Caltech,
clocks are for wimps.

The Fulcrum Microsystems Inc. design team isn't the first to propose an
asynchronous processor, but president and chief executive officer Robert
Nunn wants to be the first to take a clockless, fire-breathing processor
mainstream. ""We really deal with an asynchronous world,"" he said. ""We
only make it synchronous for our own convenience.""

This is the kind of stuff that many in the processor industry would
consider lunatic fringe, too weird for conservative embedded-systems
designers. But the young processor company and more than a dozen others
like it are anchored in the mainstream courtesy of the MIPS
instruction-set architecture. More and more, MIPS is becoming the choice
for maverick processor design teams seeking a place at the high end by
fielding unorthodox devices. And if Motorola and IBM in the PowerPC camp
aren't careful, they could see their performance leadership in the
high-end embedded-processor market snatched away by some of these upstarts.

In Austin, Texas, meanwhile, designers at another MIPS house, Intrinsity
Inc., aren't prepared to ditch the clock. But they are putting a new
spin on some old tricks such as giving each gate its own clock and then
letting them overlap. Using such sleight of hand, the company hopes to
soon deliver RISC-based processors that run at an eye-popping 2 GHz and
consume just 10 to 15 watts.

Fulcrum, Intrinsity and their brethren may once have been written off as
interesting experiments, backed by venture capitalists who overlooked
some of the finer details, like software compatibility. What lends them
respectability is MIPS.

Theirs for the asking 

One reason young processor companies seem to be flocking to the platform
is that its steward, MIPS Technologies Inc., has no qualms about
licensing the instruction-set architecture (ISA), provided that the
licensee agrees to meet a software-compatibility test suite. By
contrast, processor-core rival ARM Ltd. has granted this privilege to
just two of its many licensees, Intel and Motorola. And so far, the two
PowerPC vendors, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc., have rebuffed most
requests to license that architecture, with the notable exception being
FPGA vendor Xilinx Inc., which has licensed the 405 PowerPC from IBM.

The MIPS ISA is also one of the simplest forms of
reduced-instruction-set computing around, which tends to make it
attractive to processor designers interested in extending the
architecture. It was this and the wide availability of tools and
software that drew Intrinsity to MIPS, even though the company is aiming
at PowerPC sockets, as evidenced by its decision to adopt the RapidIO
interface instead of HyperTransport, which has been favored by MIPS vendors.

Good fit 

""It's a nice, clean architecture and has an open model that allows us to
add instructions,"" said Paul Nixon, chief executive officer of
Intrinsity.  ""You also get all the third-party tools that very easily
fit into our base of platforms.""

There was a time when this openness was seen as a liability for MIPS. In
the mid-1990s, before MIPS was spun out from Silicon Graphics Inc., the
instruction set lacked a multiply-add instruction, so some MIPS vendors
took it upon themselves to create their own. The problem was that this
broke many of the development tools, causing headaches for compiler
vendors like Green Hills Software Inc.

""We went to MIPS and said we have 20 different compiler variants and
it's embarrassing,"" said Craig Franklin, vice president of engineering
at Green Hills and a respected microprocessor industry veteran. Franklin
also wasn't shy about telling MIPS it needed to revamp its embedded
application binary interface. ""We went to MIPS and said we've done a
dozen EABIs, let's clean up yours,"" he said.

MIPS took the advice and wasted little time clamping down on
architectural deviations, observers said. But the MIPS camp still has to
live with a legacy of incompatible chips in the field. ""To its credit,
MIPS quickly caught on,"" said Jim Turley, a microprocessor industry
analyst. ""Going forward, MIPS is maintaining good control but they are
still haunted by incompatibility among multiples.""

If the biggest risk to the MIPS camp is fragmentation, then the PowerPC
camp has the opposite problem: architectural confinement. Though the
PowerPC architecture carries the cachet of household names Motorola and
IBM, these are essentially the only two companies that provide
PowerPCs. It's not for lack of interest. Rather, the companies have been
reluctant to cede control over the architecture. This could wind up
hurting the PowerPC cause, though.

""To get a PowerPC license is impossible or very expensive,"" Green Hills'
Franklin said. ""Tactically this may have been a mistake. If you're a
Japanese company, all things being equal, you'd rather buy from another
Japanese company.""

Analyst Turley, too, thinks the PowerPC camp will only stand to gain by
licensing the architecture. ""It's all about software compatibility and
tool support. The more you can proliferate the architecture the better
you're going to do,"" he said. ""I don't think Motorola and IBM can
address the entire market by themselves.""

There's a chance that this could change. IBM, for its part, is in the
process of planning an expansion strategy for PowerPC that may involve
more licensing. Though it's unlikely the PowerPC camp will ever have the
open licensing model of MIPS Technologies, MIPS processor vendors may
have more than just two competitors to worry about.

""We're certainly not averse to [licensing],"" said Lisa Su, director of
PowerPC products at IBM. ""The question is, how much do we do and who do
we license to. There are various ways you could go, whether it's a hard
core, soft core or licensing the ISA.""

But the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. ""We know
that if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on
software compatibility,"" Su said. ""With MIPS there's a degree of
fracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other
markets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a
happy medium.""

Whatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip
provider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual
property. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue
is not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from
Xilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the
architecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs
for Xilinx in its own fabs. ""We're not trying to make money off of
licensing,"" Su said.

Manufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC
vendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end
lines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology,
still rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design
relatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are
shipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a
four-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a
seven-stage pipe.

The companies say there's more performance headroom in store. ""When we
get to 0.13 micron we'll get substantially faster,"" said Raj Handa,
PowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola.

Proprietary processes 

Most MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries
that haven't developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even
though companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside
foundries, they're keeping their special process recipes in-house to
juice up their high-performance devices.

Lacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little
choice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their
chops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how
some of the newer players measure up.

Intrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the
year. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. ""We're going
to shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power
performance,"" Fulcrum's Nunn said. ""We really want to change the way the
world designs semiconductors.""

The Pasadena startup machine
By Alison Overholt
April, 2002  

There was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting
to happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans
between classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk?
Plunging into a new venture seemed all too easy.

Ah, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in
class. Venture capitalists say that they're seeing precious few
proposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save
one: the California Institute of Technology.

In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of
startups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as
it did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on
most campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine.

This didn't happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech's
Office of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for
cultivating commerce. ""We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs
scientifically more than other schools do,"" says Rich Wolfe, the
office's associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the
science itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity.

That's what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at
Caltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. ""There is a pervasive
philosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,"" Cummings
says. ""There's a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be
around. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn't
make it about business or focus on how much money they'll get out of
it. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out
into industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.""

Before starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with
Caltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an
asynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into
commercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program.

That they could afford to do that points to another, more practical
aspect to Caltech's approach. Other universities typically require
entrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use
of technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle
entrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to
spare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups,
and it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies
are financially secure.

For Caltech, it's a long-term bet. ""The reality is that universities
rely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be
collected from the initial licensing process,"" Wolfe says. ""So we seek a
bite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs
founds the next Intel, he'll not only share the equity but also bestow a
gift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he
was just getting started.""

Cummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won
about $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in
recent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who
formerly ran Vitesse's telecom division, and hired 24 top students from
their alma mater. And they've garnered rave reviews of their chip design
from technology journals.

One thing that Cummings and Lines haven't done yet: finished their
degrees. Officially, both are now ""on leave."" They may not be back.

High-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. 

Tip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If
you are stupid or have bad luck, don't start a high-tech business.

Tip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do,
not one that they want you to do.

Startup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work
with. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive.  To make a
start-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at
just the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a
success. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture
capitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk
running out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that
probably means the product won't be done. Ever.

Tip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don't take venture funding too soon. 

If you are doing a software product, don't take venture money until you
need it to introduce the product.  Don't take venture money until you
have used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law's money, and
everything you can borrow.

Bootstrap. Rent, don't buy. Don't hire people to do things you can
contract out because contractors don't require stock options.

As the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is
to manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with
fewer shares but more wealth.

Tip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch. I'm a cheap date.

out.  Problem is, they're silly, they don't want to do this, and

That sounds like fun. But it sets the wrong precedent.
Here's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon
cruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse
day sailor. Under way, ask her if she'd like to take
the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something
simple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served
in the cockpit, with an inexpensive but potable wine.

If she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If
she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs
another coat, and asks what you're using on it,
propose on the spot.

Maybe I'm the only one confused but what you are saying is that you
have a spamtrap that receives Bugtraq messages and you are auto-
matically reporting them as SPAM only to revoke them shortly there-
after???  Either way automatic reporting is a Bad Thing (tm) IMHO.
You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.  I'm not
sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs
nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you

Since I don't know what you did, exactly, I can't guess.  What you seemed to show is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so helped (the ""after"" numbers are better than the ""before"" numbers, right?). Assuming that what you did was override what's now tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn't call the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you're missing carefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many dozens of other header fields.  There's no question that adding more header fields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn't do so only because my testing corpora are such that I can't add more headers without getting major benefits for bogus reasons. Apart from all that, you said you're skipping Received.  By several accounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I'm (meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the reason explained above.  Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer reported good results from this scheme:     ip_re = re.compile(r'(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})')     for header in msg.get_all(""received"", ()):         for ip in ip_re.findall(header):             parts = ip.split(""."")             for n in range(1, 5):                 yield 'received:' + '.'.join(parts[:n]) This makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled for now.",0,0

I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project.

In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!

No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian.

Date: Not supplied

I've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 
Setup program. 

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, 
Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so 
I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer 
than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup 
process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the 
wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already 
made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to 
change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and 
everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the 
Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted 
are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result 
is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll 
write more about what I learned. 

  

One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to 
have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper 
right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently 
infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

###  **Government Personal and Business Grants Facts:**

**Over 20 Million People Get Government Money Every Year:**

1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money to start or expand a business

4,000,000 people get money to invest in real estate

6,000,000 people get money to go to college

10,000,000 people get free help and training for a better job

> expand an existing business should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-

It sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source of
free business help delivers:

Over $30 billion dollars in free business grants and low-interest loans;

over one-half trillion dollars in procurement contracts; and

over $32 billion dollars in FREE consulting and research grants.

> With an economy that remains unpredictable, and a need for even greater

In spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly huge
that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for an equal
share, they would each receive over $70,000.

Most people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who to
contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do receive
FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you should also.

yeah, I'd be with that -- as long as they have a maintainer ;)

however regarding CVS, I'd say many projects might find it easier

If you'll look closely, I said the Forest Service official claimed it was 
the tree lovers lawsuits that prevented removal of trees by any means as at 
least partially responsible.  The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service 
from implementation of any project that involved tree removal.  These 
projects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that 
resulted from previous management policies.

In other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from 
their previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover 
lawsuits.

Exactly, and tree lover lawsuits are preventing the removal of that 
stuff.  The result:  Fires like Cerro Grande.

There are very few replacement forests planted these days.  Those that are, 
are mostly planted on private land as commercial tree farms.

Anything equivalent will be spam, just not email spam.  Dump entry IPs for

Date: Not supplied

Carny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big 
business with artery-clogging horripilations: 

    In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize 
    fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden 
    snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country. 

    ""We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste 
    our Twinkie,"" said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled 
    treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of 
    Seattle. 

    As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add 
    chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top... 

    Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the 
    71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and 
    county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began 
    gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions. 

    How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an 
    estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.

I can't really tell if it was my  hacking that removed it, or if it was some transitional magic  happening since this was the first invocation of that version of  exmh. I've backed out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happens  again. On another thing with the Ftoc_RescanLine stuff. This routine is  called at times still unclar to me. An inspection of the routine  suggests that it is used in the transition of a message to/form  ""current"" state to re-paint the ftoc line. However, checking the  msg.tcl code (MSgChange) we find:     if {$msgid != {}} {         # Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line  instead         if {$msgid < 0}  return     } else {         # line null too, try using first in folder         if {[string length $line] == 0} { set line 1 }         set msgid [Ftoc_MsgNumber [Ftoc_FindMsg $msgid $line]]     }     Ftoc_ClearCurrent     Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid     Ftoc_ShowSequences $exmh(folder) The Ftoc_ClearCurrent calls Ftoc_RescanLIne to clear the '+' sign  _before_ the on-disk transition is made. I hacked this stuff and more  or less changed the order. It works, but fails on some folder changes. My feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a  Ftoc_ClearCurrent, but rather just a RescanLine and the caller had  better know the line or msgid. That routine shoud just put in the '+'  if the line/msg in question happened to be the cur msg.

Close encounter of burnt kind

IT came from outer space  or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation  that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed  because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface,"" she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
auction.
She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.""
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said.
""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear.""
To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,""
he added.

Date: Not supplied

Ben Hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link 
between Roman Chariots and the Space Shuttle. It has the ring of something 
apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless. 

    The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 
    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 
    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads 
    were built by English expatriates. 

    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's 
    the gauge they used. 

    Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used 
    that wheel spacing. 

    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried 
    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, 
    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts...

Date: 2002-10-08T20:52:08-05:00

Movable Type 2.5 is out. I'm running it and it appears to work. It incorporates 
many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
sort of way. 

The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
They should all just be ""AltTemplate"".

The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u= se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi= sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with= a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo= r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m= odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software. As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon= itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut= ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac. Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will = be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with = improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t= he background photo as often as every 5 seconds. But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch= eap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a disc= ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr= ent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h= ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst= em for the retail price of $129. Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu= alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s= hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser= vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou= s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software. Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web serv= ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t= o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service= s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a= service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu= res. Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell w= ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture= . Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously = free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when= free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to= form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently= . To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of= services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz= ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,= an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel= l for the program. **Microsoft's moves**   Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a= rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software= bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re= bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for= those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no= t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000= copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the = program went on sale last November. Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third co= llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after= a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c= ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o= perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co= uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f= ixes are available as separate downloads. Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro= soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a = site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T= he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java = inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the= forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004. **Somebody's watching you**   You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah= oo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter= to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that= pertain to Web code known as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contai= n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS= cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser= to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for = example. ""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced = e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will = open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma= nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command = line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'= s knowledge. On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g= overnment is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious acti= vity in the name of fighting terrorism.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period.

You get _exactly_ the same problem with Suse and RedHat, is that right?

1. What laptop is it?  What is the Processor and how much RAM does it have?

2. You cannot simply boot off the cdrom?  It must be quite an old laptop
then or else cdrom booting is disabled in the BIOS.  Is the cdrom external
or strange in some way?

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

No, but either due to some technical glitch, or downright just wanting
to do so, people send to the secondary.  It's a semi-usual spammer trick
actually to bypass the main server and send directly to a secondary
since it will either have less filtering, or be ""trusted"", or ...

MX records in the mail world are all explained in RFC 2821, section 5:

[...]
   Multiple MX records contain a preference indication that MUST be used
   in sorting (see below).  Lower numbers are more preferred than higher
   ones.  If there are multiple destinations with the same preference
   and there is no clear reason to favor one (e.g., by recognition of an
   easily-reached address), then the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to
   spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific
   organization.
[...]
   If it determines that it should relay the message without rewriting
   the address, it MUST sort the MX records to determine candidates for
   delivery.  The records are first ordered by preference, with the
   lowest-numbered records being most preferred.  The relay host MUST
   then inspect the list for any of the names or addresses by which it
   might be known in mail transactions.  If a matching record is found,
   all records at that preference level and higher-numbered ones MUST be
   discarded from consideration.  If there are no records left at that
   point, it is an error condition, and the message MUST be returned as
   undeliverable.  If records do remain, they SHOULD be tried, best
   preference first, as described above.

I have a version that's working now. I'll try it a couple of days and 
check it during daylight. Basically I added an agument to 
ClearCurrent and updated all callers to slap in $ftoc(curLine). I 
also flipped the order in  Msg_Change to ClearCurrent $prevline after 
the Mh_SetCur. For some reason it barfs when Marking many messages

article I was commenting on... Rohit]

In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The 
Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most 
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which 
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By 
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, 
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.

The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce 
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from 
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all 
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to 
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; 
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in 
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of 
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in 
the article.

Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic 
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free 
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest 
of the Web?

To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector 
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just 
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure 
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom 
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most 
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.

On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* 
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...

Best,
   Rohit Khare

===========================================================

The search goes on
China backtracks on banning Googleup to a point

Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print edition

IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, 
is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population of 
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving 
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked 
access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparently 
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to 
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been 
restored.

An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More 
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to 
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. 
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by 
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for 
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.

After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users 
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. 
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet 
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site 
to far less powerful search engines in China.

Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, 
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to 
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking 
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be 
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key 
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this 
week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on 
Google for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China
usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search 
also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.",0,0

Doesn't defeat this system at all. If you see that once, feed it into 
your bayesian classifier, and it classifies the URLs used for the 
images. Then next time it sees one, it knows with almost 100% accuracy 
that an email with one of those URLs is definitely spam.

In many ways this is like Razor, which is why I'm hacking on a 
distributed system to do this, to see if it's feasible to scale it globally.

ATTN:MANAGER



HELLO DEAR,

I am well confidence of your capability to assist me
in
a transaction for mutual benefit for both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish on you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.

Well, I am BELLO SANKOH, Son to MR FODAY SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars cash). This money was made from the
sell of
Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of C=F4te d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from C=F4te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another nearby country where taxation will not
take great toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
the investment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
will be invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount ( 22 million dollars ) at the end of this
business. The security of this business is very
important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential.

I shall expect your urgent reply.

My telephone number is 22507625348.

Thank you and God bless you
BELLO SANKOH Tel :22507625348

Copyright Law Thwarts Open Source Confab Demo
Posted by Dan Gillmor


Bruce Perens was going to demonstrate a modified DVD player at this week's
Open Source gathering in San Diego. He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a
DVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with
different regional codes.

Perens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological
methods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want.
And the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to
ask him not to do the demonstration.

HP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was
willing to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried
that it would be ""a more juicy target,"" the kind of deep pockets that
might make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's
understandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would
take a stand on the right side of this issue.

So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on
things like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A
shame, but that's how things are going these days.

Hollywood is winning, folks. You are losing. And you'd better start caring

hosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing
working nice and easily.
At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3
mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
""To:"" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.

Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.

Thanks,

Lt. Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happened Wednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colo., was continuing to investigate.  The reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it could have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or approaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Pentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace.  A contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold air.  The jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source of the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD spokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initial report at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking radars in search of evidence, he said.  A Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``what appeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,'' originally in the vicinity of the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.  ``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the United States,'' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported the contrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightings were reported.''  The reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, the Pentagon statement said.  At the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I'm aware of the reports.'' He referred all questions to NORAD.  Jenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the Caribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets or from which military bases they were scrambled.  ``We don't necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us to investigate'' a contrail, he said.  Meanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday had people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stations with calls reporting a meteor shower.  It was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-entering the Earth's atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha, Neb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russian rocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details.

Hettinga""  Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender:  http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp Posted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation By Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology Columnist The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California. Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes. The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices. And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.'' How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient. More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources. If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles. State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org). It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market. We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential. But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both. The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner. But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough. The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace. Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether. Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly. It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year. --  ----------------- R. A.

Your vote on Crop Idol 
By OLIVER HARVEY

WELCOME to Crop Idol  your chance to choose Britain's most out-of-this-wor=
ld corn circle. 


The intricate patterns, which some say are the work of aliens, are big news=
 again thanks to the spooky new Mel Gibson film Signs.


Nine of the best are shown on the right. You can vote for your favourite by=
 clicking on the image and dialling the number shown beneath.

Calls cost only 10p, or 12 cents from the Republic of Ireland (though it ma=
y be a bit more if you contact us from other planets).

Lines close at 6pm today. We will reveal the
winner tomorrow.


Aliens ... or hoaxers?
THE debate continues to rage over the origin of crop circles.

Many believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers  while others are c=
onvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.

Crop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly a=
nd on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. =


Witnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields =
on the nights that circles appear.

Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a=
ncient religions, mathematics and even music. 

Crop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appea=
r throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the sout=
h of England.

Theories about their cause include whirlwinds  known to circle experts as =
plasma vortexes  earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the huma=
n mind.

In the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs=
, helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.

Raymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last nigh=
t: ""It's a great unsolved mystery.

""We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for s=
ure what is making them.""

gkm@petting-zoo.net (glen mccready),0xdeadbeef@petting-zoo.net,"Sun, 18 Aug 2002 15:18:04 -0700",The Beer Scooter,"[I'm sure somebody will tell me about the original source; it's in a number of places on the web. -gkm] Forwarded-by: Colin Burgess  The Beer Scooter  How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night drinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home? As hard as you try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to your house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer Scooter. The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased to the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched out since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and has bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter works in the following fashion:- The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the ""slurring gland"" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of his many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a winged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits them in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is not cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket cash is taken as payment. This answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend so much money?' Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are thought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified Drinking Injuries).  An undocumented feature of the beer scooter is the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of Trans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly unaccounted for. This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell happened?' With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of Embarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes, in descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately one person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and quite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of time. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often cause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending the passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences. With recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in a scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and pizza crusts. Another question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come equipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and Thump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in such a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs, you are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity springs ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the CTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised shins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some scooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how one person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a single night. PS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably get home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a T-shirt.",0,0

|  **Dear Readers,**  
With all the corporate scandals--such as WorldCom and Enron--surrounding us,
who can you trust nowadays? Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message
Boards. The CNET Message Boards are as real as it gets. When it comes down to
giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the
Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life
experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common
interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky
execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or
question in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.

**Why I don't use firewalls**  
Do you need some honest opinions? Despite all the horror stories that you hear
of hackers and Trojans intruding on one's personal computer, hear why one of
our veteran moderators refuses to use a firewall. This discussion gets a bit
heated, but her point was well taken. Take a look and see why she refuses, and
if you have a cent or two to throw in, the donation jar is wide open. More

**The scoop on USB 2.0**  
The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer
peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what
is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1? Will your current USB port be
compatible with peripherals with the new version? Well if you have similar
questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will
bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick.

  * USB vs. USB 2.O
  * How to upgrade from USB 1.1 to 2.0?
  * USB 2.0 with reverse compatibility with USB 1.1?
  * More Hardware discussions 

**Windows XP not any faster than Windows 98SE?!**  
Many users have jumped ship and moved on to newer and supposedly better things
such as Windows XP, but what if it doesn't perform up to par and is actually
slower than the previous OS that you had? Check out this discussion; what's
newer may not always be faster. More Windows XP discussions

**Best type of backup system to use for someone that is indigent?**  
Backing up your hard-drive system sounds like a task for veteran, but is it?
In this discussion, a beginner is asking for sound advice on the best type of
backup system to use, and sure enough, he received a bunch of options to
choose from. If you're in that same boat and looking for the best ways to back
up some of that important data of yours, this discussion is for you. Have a
look. More Computer Newbies discussions

**Warning for kids and teens online**  
If you're a parent, this may be something that you may want to read about kids
online. I found it interesting enough to pass along because I know someday
I'll be faced with the same worries when my kids are out surfing the web. So
have a look, and if it doesn't interest you, pass it on to someone who may
find it informative.

Not only do I know that, the post to which you were responding explained that, with somewhat more detail than ""a joke"".  As you should know, but evidently don't, poll() isn't even ""a bit better"" --- in fact, it's about an order of magnitude worse --- for dense file descriptor sets, which is the normal case.

After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally   catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for   nontrivial apps? No way! The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try to tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don't care --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't ""totally suck for nontrivial apps"". For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of concurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could probably find much earlier references if I had time: http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html (more details at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/io-events.html; details on the SGI patch are at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/faq.html) > > Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations > > have supported multithreading for a decade or more. >  > And most UNIX is still kinda-sorta supporting the pthreads (POSIX) > interface, each in their own 7/8 implementation. You're safe if you > stick to the basics. Your original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading or multiprogramming well.  Now that I've pointed out how obviously idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although individual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their implementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads specification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written pthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own experience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to prefer Windows. I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading implementations.  Spare us.

I, at least, have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant, which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine. The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY) where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary selection (that is, set it to be a null string). Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that. That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue. Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal ""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff"" is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere). kre ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that part of the code and see how it all really operates. _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users",0,1

'Siberia Bound: Chasing the American Dream on Russia's Wild Frontier' by 
Alexander Blakely

SIBERIA BOUND
Chasing the American Dream On Russia's Wild Frontier
By Alexander Blakely
Sourcebooks. 320 pp. $22.95

Judging from Siberia Bound, Alexander Blakely seems like a pretty cool 
guy -- adventurous, engaging and fun to hang out with. After all, most 
chroniclers of Russian life base their tales in Moscow or, alternately, 
St. Petersburg, the most livable of Russia's not-very-livable cities. 
Deciding instead to settle in a former academic community outside of 
Novosibirsk, one of Siberia's major cities, Blakely set out to pursue, 
as his book's subtitle declares, ""the American dream on Russia's wild 
frontier.""

Blakely, who moved to Siberia after finishing college with an economics 
degree, has a breezy writing style. And although his book is flawed in 
many respects, it does include some sharp observations of life in 
Russia. ""Usually with construction,"" he tells us, for instance, ""you 
have two choices: 1) you can do it quickly, or 2) you can do it right. 
The Soviet construction worker . . . takes his time doing things wrong.""

Anyone who has spent time in Siberia knows that its inhabitants are a 
breed apart. They disdain their compatriots in the country's Western 
regions and pride themselves -- perhaps excessively -- on their courage, 
strength and inner fortitude. Siberia, in fact, occupies a space in the 
Russian national psyche similar to that of the Wild West in American 
mythology. The efforts throughout the 16th and 17th centuries to settle 
Siberia's vast expanse and exploit its natural resources still resonate 
with Russians. So does the region's role as a convenient dumping ground 
for criminals and political dissidents during the czarist centuries and 
as home to the cruel network of gulags in Soviet times.

Unfortunately, little of this rich brew of history and myth makes an 
appearance in Siberia Bound. Neither do lots of other pertinent facts. 
Russians often say that, in Russia, anything can happen -- and usually 
does. So it's easy to believe that two young men could establish a 
chocolate business on little more than hope, smarts and chutzpah. But 
while Blakely describes establishing a cocoa-bean importing business 
with his friend Sasha, we never learn how they met in the first place or 
why he believes Sasha to be a trustworthy associate. The two of them 
strike a deal to sell their beans to a local chocolate factory, yet we 
find out virtually nothing about the chocolate the factory produces. Is 
it tasty? Disgusting? Are we talking chocolate bars, chocolate truffles 
or chocolate syrup? A few details would go a long way here.

The author has the makings of a terrific story. But even though Siberia 
Bound includes frequent humorous episodes, Blakely generally fails to 
transform the pungent ingredients into a satisfying meal. The constant 
descriptions of encounters and conversations ultimately differ little 
from one another. People are forever winking, smirking and slapping one 
another on the back. Slamming down shots of vodka and making sentimental 
toasts to women and friendship play an inevitable role in any account of 
Russian life, but reading about such occasions becomes tiresome after 
the 20th or 30th repetition.

Blakely is also given to facile comments that are meant to sound smart 
but often fall flat. ""Democracy and the free market, the best 
institutions the West had to offer, stormed over the borders and ran 
deep into Russia,"" he tells us. ""But like all foreign armies throughout 
history, they quickly were spread too thin and became diluted."" And then 
there's this summation of his time in Russia: ""Those four years have 
left me with a lifetime of rabid ambivalence to chew on until I've got 
no teeth left.""

Blakely manages to include a few unpleasant -- and wholly unnecessary -- 
laughs at the expense of Chinese workers and gays. And although I like 
wordplay as much as the next guy, it's jarring when non-English-speaking 
characters make puns in English. ""In a pinch,"" says one character, a 
chocolate factory director who warns Blakely not to store extra cocoa 
beans on site, ""I'm afraid we would probably take a pinch.""

Some of these faults wouldn't matter if Siberia Bound were a picaresque 
novel or an account that didn't aspire to authenticity. But the effect 
here is to undermine a reader's faith in the narrator's reliability and 
to reduce most of the characters to the stock figures encountered in 
dozens of other accounts of Russian life. So in the end, I believed the 
broad contours of Blakely's story but found it hard to take seriously 
many of the particulars. And his ultimate conclusion -- that capitalism, 
material comfort and wealth do not bring happiness -- hardly qualifies 
as a revelation.

In short yes. The more logic involved the longer
the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic
executed (including NIC logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. So how much
logic is involved for each type of IPC (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). Anyway the
best IPC method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various IPC mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.

IBM are running a series comparing doze and Linux IPC mechanisms.
The socket (which references the others at the bottom) is here:
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-rt6/?t=gr,Redhat=Sockets

The following in google gave useful info also:
""linux IPC mechanisms compared""

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 information

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

The overkill variant of this feature would have scores scored by (score * relative-time-taken) with relative-time-taken computed over a large corpus (probably Craig's ;} ). Then you could specify a minimum value of *that* parameter to flatten at, giving assurances that you're killing only tests that are expensive for their utility.

           Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: P2
         Component: Rules
        AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com


The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.

Here is what I got:

OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME
  15113     4797    10316    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages)
100.000   31.741   68.259    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)
  1.244    3.877    0.019    1.00    0.64    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS6
  0.576    1.459    0.165    0.90    0.43    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS5
  4.982   10.694    2.326    0.82    0.38    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS4
  3.434    6.337    2.084    0.75    0.35    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS3
  8.979   12.383    7.396    0.63    0.30    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS2
  8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1

I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:

  7.024   28.480    2.834    0.91    0.50    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

and my stats:

 19.228   34.793   11.991    0.74    0.35    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All

October 2, 2002
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 




 

Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""


Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. 

There was only one problem, the health organization said in
a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
subject. 

""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United
Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we
have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" 

All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a
blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.
But none reported any scientific details from the study or
the names of the scientists who conducted it. 

On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a
conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
brunets."" 

Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""


Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
who said he had read it in a British newspaper. 

In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
the last true blond to hail from Finland. 

The British accounts were replete with the views of
bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
endangered species. 

Journalists in London said last night that the source of
the reports was probably one of several European news
agencies that are used by the British press, but it
remained unclear which one. 

Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it
up,"" he said. 

But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
Association, said that although it had considered running

Eamonn Shinners <shinnere@gofree.indigo.ie>,ILUG <ilug@linux.ie>,03 Aug 2002 15:02:32 +0100,[ILUG] Network problems,"Hi guys,
	I'm looking for help on this one. I have a server with SME5.5 installed
- used to be e-smith. It's based on RH7.1, has a 3c507 NIC, and is
connected to a hub. Also connected to the hub are a laptop and
workstation, both with RH7.3 . The server supplies DHCP amongst other
things.
	The problem is interruptions in the network. If I ping the laptop from
the workstation, or the other way around, there are no problems, i.e.
shows up as 0% loss. If however I ping the server from the laptop or
workstation, it will do a few packets, anywhere from 3 to 20, and then
stop responding, it will start again after a little while.
	The server is definitely not overloaded, 128Mb, and seems to be
configured correctly. In /etc/modules.conf,;

options 3c507 irq=0x5 io=0x300
alias eth0 3c507

there is an option in there for something called hisax, but whatever
that is, the machine doesn't have one.
	doing route shows 192.168.0.0 as going through eth0 which is correct.

	Any help on this appreciated.

John Gay <johngay@eircom.net>,ilug@linux.ie,"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 23:24:30 +0100",[ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2,"A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium. One 
person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on 
another list and got a few answers, most were ""don't even think about it"" but 
a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch.

After having a good search around the lfs site, I've decided I'm going to 
give it a whirl. I've got a spare box and loads of free time, so why not ;-)

The lfs site, however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or 
GlibC? A quick google found PGCC, a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC, but the 
site does not seem to have been updated in quite some time?

So, my general plan, and I'm taking my time with this:

Partition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions, /, /usr, /var 
and /home.
Install a base Debian system into the /home  partition so I can build the 
rest of the system into the other partitions.
Using Debian, build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. I'll 
try to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage.
chroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs.
strip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot 
from / rather than /home, then move /home to it's proper partition.

All going well, I should now have a full base Linux system running that is 
fully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC.

Now I can build zlib and then X, again optimizing. And I can follow this with 
the various graphics libs, qt lib and finally KDE.

If all goes well, I will probably repeate this for my Dual system, once I can 
find a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Iv'e got.

I might even be tempted to write this up for the site.

Cheers,

WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET 5. SITE STATISTICS 0. INTRO Hello SourceForge.net Users, This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you. These databases manage everything from user authentication, session management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database- dependent website. Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2, a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and 70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the press release here: http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much difference other then the site will continue to grow and the SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of the databases advanced capabilities. Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months. If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site, please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always appreciate the feedback. Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the Open Source Community. Pat- Patrick McGovern Director, SourceForge.net 1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source community can always obtain the software released by hosted projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world, as to provide better download times regardless of which network provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location. Three new download servers have recently been added to our network, further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest additions include servers hosted by: Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA); http://www.twtelecom.com/ University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA) http://www.umn.edu/ CESNET (Czech Republic) http://www.cesnet.cz/ We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and the needs of the Open Source community. On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net 2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE SourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX Kernel Summit, held in June.  Listen to the Linux kernel master discuss such hot topics as kernel modules, virtual memory, block I/O, database scaling, security modules, and async I/O. You may find this audio repository at: http://linuxkernel.foundries.sourceforge.net/article.pl?sid=02/06/26/0116225 3. CONTRIBUTE TO SOURCEFORGE.NET! BE A FOUNDRY GUIDE! Want to contribute to SourceForge.net, but you don't know how to code? Be a foundry guide!  Foundry guides get to hype the cool projects that they think are worth downloading and testing. A guide finds all the stuff on the web about their subject of choice, and gives it prominent placement.  How do you become a foundry guide? Go to http://foundries.sourceforge.net/; find a topic that interests you; and send email to foundries@sourceforge.net stating your desired topic and why you are qualified to be a foundry guide. 4.

The Bell labs Unix people implemented hard links, whereas Bill Joy and co. at Berkeley implemented soft links, five years later, mainly to get around not being able to do cross-device hard linking, as I understand it. Soft links are fairly classic Berkeley hackery (cf. gethostbyname, h_errno, and the resultant problems implementing mt-safe interfaces); they do what they were intended for, but break fairly easily, in this case when the target file was deleted.

With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. 

It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. 

My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.

When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !
 En!
gland for 9years now. 

I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. 

To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. 

For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.

Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. 

I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.

Yours sincerely,
Donald Phiri.

There's been some discussion just now on the ILUG IRC channel about OSI and
protocol layers. This reminded me of a poster produced by Wandel &
Goltermann (manufactureres of fine protocol decoders and testers) which
illustrates this admirably. The poster is in the form of a PDF file and to
be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or
somesuch device. Wandel & Goltermann has now become/been taken over by
acterna and I couldn't find the poster there. However, it's available at
http://www.pb.bib.de/~dozloh/fachinfo/sdn_16/decodes.pdf and some of you ma
find it interesting.

The top of the poster refers you to www.decodes.com for a more up to date
online copy of the poster. However, www.decodes.com now is redirected to the

but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report
from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user.
The way I solved it was to run 

razor-admin -create

and

razor-admin -discover

with a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is
explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe.

The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be
loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a
.razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist
(although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may
lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery
and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The
workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to
razorhome on the command line, e.g.

razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create
razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discover

Which annoyance? A string like f70539bb32961f3d7dba42a9c51442c1218a9100

Yeah but I was right and I was there. The people who were saying that it
did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back
after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at
the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the
.ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the
secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an
NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not
there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.
History now but it has an alarming relevance. :)

Confirm that. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from
what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the
initial SOA problems. 

I am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for
inclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically
incapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands
the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS
for its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be
investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the
company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not
actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company
should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss
of synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -
more like e-jit central! :)

The GPL makes no stipulations about charging for binaries. In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true, compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you just might get away with it!) However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must  provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just might make money at this, since there might be a market of 10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of getting a binary. But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for 1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite /bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is. You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost (or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_ charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of business faster than a dot-com in 2001. And there are real ways to provide this value for money (convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates, convenience of having what lots of other people have, posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from a ""real"" company, etc). There will be segments of the market that will pay various amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't. Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the source will always be free (or minimal cost). Later, Kenn --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

 See, the IDE subsystem is like the One Ring. It's kludginess, due to
having to support hundreds of dodgy chipsets & drives means that it is
inherintly evil. A few months of looking at the code can turn you sour.
Years of looking at it will turn you into an arsehole.

 They haven't found a hobbit that can code, so mortal humans have to
suffice.

Get a very, *very* small set of drill bits.  Start drilling right
through the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop
off and through the board!  Once you have a bit of an indent in,
increase the speed a little bit.

If you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use
the next largest drill bit you have.  Repeat until happy.

Eventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the
board off over the shaft of the screw... then ye can take out the
rest fairly easily with a pliers or whatnot.

The point could also be to hassle the sunbather for reasons not given in
the story.  The sunbather has probably pissed off the complainers in other
ways, too.

Law and society are wholeheartedly trivial.  Big fuzzy concepts like
""sluts vs. moms"" are convenient vehicles for petty disputes as often as
not.

Moller, a public company in Davis, California, has developed a flying car.  

    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/flyingcar.jpg] Moller International 
    has developed the first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal 
    vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen. 

    You've always known it was just a matter of time before the world demanded 
    some kind of flying machine which would replace the automobile. Of course, 
    this machine would have to be capable of VTOL, be easy to maintain, cost 
    effective and reliable. Well, we at Moller International believe we have 
    come up with the solution. That solution is the volantor named M400 Skycar.

Using the score-ranges stuff and my aggressive anti-FP evaluation code,
BTW, yielded an average FP of 5.7 points, with 0.67% FPs and 96.57%
overall accuracy -- but I notice you went back to the other method.

I noticed a low count of razor'd spam messages. So after digging, if I
razor-report a message the diags say that it was accepted but if I turn
around and run a check on the exact same message that was reported, then
it doesn't find the sig and as such isn't spam.

response to this elsewhere.

I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).

bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
delivery.

As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.

But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?

As I mentioned in my email to Anders, it's certainly in my code and I don't 
have time to work on it right now, so I would not be offended if you worked on 
it.

I just this moment found out that my partner has promised a few things would be 
done before my vacation that will require my efforts, so it's even more true 
that it was when I sent the mail to Anders.

 Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.

 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.

 Woohoo.

>That means *you* can't say anything may not be FoRKed or printed or 
>whatever. You have the choice to ignore it


That's not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot 
say what can't be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly, 
The New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is ""fit to print."" If 
the Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O'Donnell, it would 
be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it 
chose to print something Rosie O'Donnell doesn't like. The necessary 
corollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to 
refuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a 
state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them 
news.

The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other 
specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the 
""publisher"" (if any) decides or the ""community"" (if any) negotiates or does 
as a matter of custom.

For my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an 
expression of their political beliefs.

I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.Also, I thinkusinga sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did likehowthefont color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.Idon't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage,it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactiveopinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothesite content helps when new visitors visit.Onyour home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.Ifyou do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferentpictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepictureon each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website.Onyourarticles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseofthe background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehindthat would work better.Lookfor a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepagesbut I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.Iwent to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is mucheasiertodeal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~Thisis an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not allof whichIvisited - and it has something for every member of the family, however,mostofit is for either mothers or the kids.

Good points all but they don't apply in this case.  Someone is speaking and
a group of selfish bastards only interested in getting their rocks off are
trying to shout him down (they are doing it because 'it's good for the
soul'. Kind like Chuckie Manson doing the stuff he did cause 'it was good
for his soul'). Unprincipled and evil. It's got nothing to do with throwing
tea in the harbor or the DoI.

Do take the cat to a vet for a checkup and make sure it gets the proper shots, etc.  Might be a good idea to have the ""snip"" done too while you're there. (the cat, not you!!)  Most sanctuaries will make sure these jobs are already done but you should make sure.

A word of warning, some cats in sanctuaries will have been mistreated in past lives and might not be good with kids, or could be quite nervous.  Bring your daughter to see the cat you've chosen to see how they react to one another.

well, smtp being store and forward, what is an smtp proxy? :) that's 
why i said ""proxy"".

probably, the most effective way to stop spam in the long-term is to 
configure your email server to use the SPEWS blacklist and a good open 
relay blacklist.

SPEWS: to force ISPs to take action against spammers 

SPEWS /will/ list entire ISP netblocks /if/ the ISP consistently
ignores/fails to take action on abuse reports over the course of
several months. however, they're pretty quick at delisting once action
is taken. in the long-term, and in absence of global and effective 
anti-UCE regulations, it's the only realistic way to get to a spam 
free internet.

Open relay lists: to protect against relays obviously.

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda happened
with yesterday's tip. I forgot to mention that the String value's label is
""Logging"" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger, eh? The oversight
was totally my fault. I've been thinking about asking Gretchen and Brian to
help with future reviews. Don't be surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure
you'd welcome a female perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our
landlords pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the Internet? You
betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and rugs. I have a feeling I'll
be the one tweaking furniture layout. Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet.
I wonder if Ikea has an affiliate program?

I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but did you know
that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If you send an HTML message
to someone who has a yahoo.com account, something may get lost in the
translation. Try sending this sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression
to evaluate."" Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results
will surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit Marion
Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda funny, in a weird
sort of way. Not that I would want anything I send changed in any way, shape,
or form. It begs the question: what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give
them a bit, and they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's
throw away.

I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is this crazy
business with the broadband metering? What they advertise doesn't seem to be
what you get. Now that I'm forking out $60 per month for a supposed metered
rate of 640 down / 320 up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not
sure what I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure if
I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me out here? I'm
feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig is full? That is what
they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT I was paying for. I want
consistent speed - is this too much to ask?"" It's not too much to ask the
question, but it's probably too much to get the answer. I'm facing the same
dilemma right now, even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my
area. Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches on.
Watch those EULAs, folks.

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

**Directory Lister v0.5.2 [547k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://freeware.prv.pl/

{List directory contents} When I was younger, I'd get so frustrated at those
games where you'd have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two
pictures. I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When
I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my
computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does
Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also
let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who
want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and
uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows
the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it
easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.

  
**Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREE**

http://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm

{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run
into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an
""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow
encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this
handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same
technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web
Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning,
or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I
will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...

**CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20**  
Unearthed by Shawn Verrall

http://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp

{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The
Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar,
and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to
be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's
best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar
contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you
can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own
creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to
determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an
added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the
program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to
remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the
first place, that is. Dude, where's my car?

I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the
mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows
Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and
there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If
you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to
do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and
you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu
isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here...
just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it
belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use
that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

The bombes used for Enigma were electro-mechanical. I'm not aware of any application of optical techniques to Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified.

 Ah, you see - cobalt's don't use lilo. They have an openboot-like prom
that looks in an ext2 partition in /dev/hda1 for a file called
/boot/vmlinux.gz - nothing else.

 The only way I think you can set parameters is with a ""set_params"" line.

 However, when I run 
    set_params root=/dev/hda2
 and then run:
    bfd /boot/vmlinux.gz

 It boots the old kernel, I assume from the prom. It seems to do this, if
something goes wrong - no error, just boots the default kernel.

 BTW, 'bfd' means 'boot from disk'.

Date: Not supplied

Disney's themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war 
with Iraq could really kill 'em: 

    While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by 
    steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver 
    record profit for Disney year after year. 

    ""The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,"" 
    said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. ""It was an astounding 
    growth period.... Now they're overexposed.""... 

    Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to 
    $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 
    2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on 
    whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.

Compliments of the season.  I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in this letter.  Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. 

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigerias Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. 

In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. The source of the funds is as follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !
and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, Companys name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct Telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my America Internet Fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only.
It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.

Best regards,

When I was in Omaha a couple of weeks ago, I made the unfortunate mistake of
driving through the intersection of 90th and Dodge. Those of you in Omaha know
what sorts of things I was muttering under my breath during the ordeal. Is it
possible to suffer from road rage when you're not moving? Omaha has started a
10 year project on Dodge street, which more or less divides the city in half
east to west. The traffic tie-ups due to the construction disaster at 90th and
Dodge are being felt by nearby businesses. A bank is fighting back in a
creative way, replacing random $20 and $10 bills in their ATM machine with $50
and $20 notes respectively to reward lucky customers for their patronage. And
I just drove right by the place.

The route to Des Moines from Waterloo isn't much better right now as they
widen highway 330/65 to 4 lane between Marshalltown and Des Moines. Once
that's done, it will cut 20-30 minutes from the trip, and judging from the
progress they've been making, it won't be too much longer. That's probably the
fastest moving highway construction I've seen during my travels throughout
Iowa over the years. As you travel to Gnomedex from all manner of locales, be
sure to keep tabs on construction at this handy site put up by the Iowa
Department of Transportation.

See You in Des Moines,

Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client is a free download that allows computers
running Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition (Me), or Windows NT Workstation
4.0 to use Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) connections with Internet
Protocol security (IPSec). The combination of L2TP and IPSec, known as
L2TP/IPSec, is a highly secure technology for making remote access virtual
private network (VPN) connections across public networks such as the Internet.
Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client also provides support for IPSec Network

**Iomega Intros 750MB Zip**

http://www.iomega.com/zip

I've all but ditched Zip drive use entirely due to cost and small capacity. I
know many people that still use Zip drives, and I still play with a 1GB Jaz
drive from time to time, but with the ease and low cost of CD-RW drives and
media, Zip just hasn't stood a chance. Now that Iomega has bumped the capacity
to 750MB, employed USB 2.0 and pushed the speed of the drives significantly
higher, maybe it's still worth a look for those that need a fast removable
media option. I'll stick with CD-RW myself. I'll sacrifice some speed for the
reliability of optical media. But that's just me.

**Technical Overview of .NET File Services**

http://www.microsoft.com/windows.netserver/techinfo/overview/file.mspx

.NET Server is more than Windows 2000 with a look of Windows XP, of that you
can be sure. Common sense has finally won, with the developers delivering many
more command line tools to manage core services. Of course, this isn't the
only thing being brought to the .NET table. Improvements in DFS, defrag,
chkdsk and EFS just scratch the surface. New WHQL processes are being
established for antivirus products, allowing them to hook directly into the
OS. Virtual Disk Service, Volume Shadow Copy Service and promised improvements
in the File Replication Service should make managing storage easier and more
flexible.

**P4 Performance Goes to Court**

http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp

A class action lawsuit has been filed in California by a small group of PC
owners that are miffed about the performance, or lack thereof, that was
promised by Intel, HP and Gateway. Since the day the P4 was introduced, the
overall performance has been criticized, so this would seem to be more an
issue of failing to do proper due diligence on the part of the customer, if
you ask me. This is one of those subjective questions that will come down to
fancy lawyers and luck of the jury pool draw. If they believed everything the
TV commercials had to say, then the litigants got what they had coming. One
beer tastes better than the next, only one car can save your life in a crash,
etc. This general lag in P4 muscle has been publicized since day one, as have
crash test results on the part of the government and third-party
organizations. Should we be suing auto makers when someone dies in a 5-star
rated vehicle? That Volvo will save your life, ya know. Does this set an
unreasonable expectation? Only if you consider advertising an education.

Actually, 5.6. I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that 
the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short 
loop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
them, can you please let me know? Thank you. 

I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another 
runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
runner. 

Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
then get invigorated and run another mile. 

And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
run. 

There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a 
runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you 
should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to 
maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't 
worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just 
another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.",0,1

that was before my time.  all unix systems i've used didn't allow hard
links to directories, or if they did they were restricted to root.
the reason why is because you could cause infinite loops in the kernel -
usually a bad place for infinite loops.

to make them consistent with hard links.

let's call these super-soft-links.  ln -ss

    % ln -ss foo bar
    % ls -i foo
    111 foo
    % mv floyd foo
    % ls -i foo
    222 foo

and now bar no longer points to foo.

    % ln -ss foo bar
    % ls -i foo
    111 foo
    % rm foo
    % touch floyd
    % ls -i floyd
    111 floyd

the fs would need to maintain a table of links going the other direction.
so when the move command unlinks foo in the first example, it could
check the table and mark that bar is now disconnected.  the same would
be true for the second example - and even more important since bar points
to floyd if no table is consulted.

and this all fails to handle nfs mounted file systems or filesystems
that have dynamic inodes (the fat fs's and reiser lacks inodes i think).

The Cobalt systems have some neat firmware boot code that will read the
ext2 filesystem and find the kernel itself... if you put it exactly where
they expect it.

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 

Best regards, 
Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

Couldn't have put it better myself, but that's not going to stop me trying :-)  The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more the files ""real"" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

The onboard DVMT card has an Intel 845 G/GL chipset.
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/linux/ or
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/intel845g/linux.htm has more specific
information. There is help available there.

I also found somewhere (not through personal experience though) that
2.4.19-pre10ac2 includes drivers for the chipset ?

IIRC, if the query string contains

varname=FIRST&varname=SECOND

then PHP will create a variable called ""varname"" with result SECOND. 
However, if the query string contains

varname[]=FIRST&varname[]=SECOND

then PHP will create an array with varname[1]==FIRST and varname[2]==SECOND

There are other ways to get the data from the HTTP request, and I guess 
I'll do that if it turns out to simplify the script that creates the 
form; but as i understand it that's the ""official"" way to get data from 
a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.

I didn't think that jot was installed on Linux systems by default,
so from the tone of Padraigs mail that's not what he wanted,
however, if I'm incorrect (don't have a Linux system to hand) the
following is the syntax.

jot -b ""string"" 3

whom I work) received from an individual claiming to represent Cloudmark.
The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our
mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain
information proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be
required to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I was
wondering if anyone else has received such a call?

I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users
with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or
whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by
the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and
the likes).

Looks cute. For what it's worth I worked closely with a few
of the people on the team. One was my officemate for years.

Unfortunately there's no way I'm loading all the .NET stuff
on my machine. Not yet. And hopefully by the time it's all
stable, I'll be running FreeBSD again on my laptop, and it will
be moot anyway.

Research Alert - Undervalued
August 26, 2002
XrayMedia
(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8

Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! 

Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.

Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... 

Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!

How does the company do this? 

XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. 

Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.

While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.

 *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.

*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. 

*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.

*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.

*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. 

*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

 Most likely. But, seeing as I've flashed the thing with the most
up-to-date BIOS I could get (with all the screaming 'experimental' stuff
you usually see), and no luck.

 Next trick is to format /boot as ext2, and try again.

eric nichols <matchsprint@trackbike.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Thu, 5 Sep 2002 15:17:36 -0700 (PDT)",[ILUG] PCTel modules,"Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make"" after I get the output from the ./configure. 

However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
* cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config
* make oldconfig
* make dep
The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?

Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory

The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?

It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric

Both are reliable.  ""Reliability"" is more a function of the software
engineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software in
Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is
sitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running
months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure
every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
design/programming issue.

That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
raw performance scalability.

This is one of those formally difficult points from a philosophy 
perspective.   You can't really throw out intuition and emotion because 
reason really only gets you answers that reflect the genome and the 
ancestral environment.   Going forward requires creativity and experiment.

This detailed output can be in the form of logs or debug output as is the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more information on the screen using a short number than it is to write an essay about why some event happened.

These environments are typically complicated and the stakes are high because so many mission-critical systems rely on telephony.

Delay is generally defined as the time it takes from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually has many components.

Because every time someone submitted a bug, they'd get a response
saying ""Message is held for moderator because of implicit message

"""Peter Staunton"" <peter@staunton.ie>",ilug@linux.ie,"Thu, 22 Aug 2002 18:57:35 GMT",[ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2,"Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.

 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,
Peter

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Thu, 25 Jul 2002 19:56:46 -0400 (EDT)",Wear Sunscreen,"""Yes, and Eliza and I composed a precocious critique of the Constitution
of the United States of America, too. We argued that it was as good a
scheme for misery as any, since its success in keeping the common people
reasonably happy and proud depended on the strength of the people
themselves - and yet it described no practical machinery which would tend
to make the people, as opposed to their elected representatives, strong.
    We said it was possible that the framers of the Constitution were
blind to the beauty of persons who were without great wealth or powerful
friends or public office, but who were nonetheless genuinely strong.
    We thought it was more likely, though, that the framers had not
noticed that it was natural, and therefore almost inevitable, that human
beings in extraordinary and enduring situations should think of themselves
as composing new families. Eliza and I pointed out that this happened no
less in democracies than in tyrannies, since human beings were the same
the wide world over, and civilized only yesterday.
    Elected representatives, hence, could be expected to become members of
the famous and powerful family of elected representatives - which would,
perfectly naturally, make them wary and squeamish and stingy with respect
to all the other sorts of families which, again, perfectly naturally,
subdivided mankind.
    Eliza and I, thinking as halves of a single genius, proposed that the
Constitution be amended so as to guarantee that every citizen, no matter
how humble or crazy or incompetent or deformed, somehow be given
membership in some family as covertly xenophobic and crafty as the one
their public servants formed.
    Good for Eliza and me!

Hi

I have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new
to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.

The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly
miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes
). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2),
and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.

Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT
Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again
it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.

If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.
Please keep in mind I am new to it though.

Thanks

Mark

There's some interesting info at:

http://mit.fnal.gov/~msn/cdf/caf/server_evaluation.html

We've decided to go with XFS (which Linus has just merged into the 2.5 
tree), mostly because none of the other journaled fs's can maintain >30 
GB/s rates with a nearly full filesystem (mostly GB files) with random 
deletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store). 
  Ext3 almost did it but dropped from from ~38MB/s to 10 with random 
deletions, and didn't want to do direct io at all.  Only concern is an 
occasional system lock-up we haven't chased down yet.  A load avg > 100 
is always a patio of fun.

Oddly, even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up 
with the new STK 9940B tape drives, which crank along at a steady 
30GB/s.  And you oldforktimers will remember ""doofus"" my old file server 
system.  It would only take 2.1"" of rackspace now, instead of 14 racks.
