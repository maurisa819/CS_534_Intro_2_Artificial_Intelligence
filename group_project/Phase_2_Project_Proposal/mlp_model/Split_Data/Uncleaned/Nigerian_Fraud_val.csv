,idresadama@yahoo.fr,,USE THE NAME ADAMA,"Dear,
   
  I am writing to solicit your cooperation in executing a very profitable and risk free transaction. I have confidence that you have the ability to execute this business to our benefit and believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence I am willing to repose in you.
   
  I attended a Business seminar here in Cte d'Ivoire, While in this seminar, I was lucky to meet Alhaji Fofanah the owner of one of the largest Agricultural Firm dealing on Life stock ets. Alhaji Fofanah is an accomplished agriculturist who specialise in cattle farms and various other agricultural product for export. He has farm in different countries of West Africa. But above all he is one of the greatest suppliers of cattle, beef and other dairy products in this part of the world. Due to my relationship with Alhaji Fofanah and on getting to know my profession, Alhaji Fofanah took me into confidence by informing me about huge amount of money he spends on the purchase of a particular and very important medicine for his cattle. 
   
  He informed me that he buys this product at the rate of $5,000.00USD per carton, and that he mostly buys to the excess of 300 cartons. He informed me that he was only asking me to find out if I can also source for him a cheaper supplier considering the recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market which is affecting his business.
   
  I discussed this business with someone here and he decided to handle the supply by himself. We carried out a market research and discovered that we could purchase this cattle medicine somewhere cheaper in Europe for $ 3,000.00 USD per carton. We moved to Alhaji Fofanah to make a supply to him at $ 4,800.00 USD per Carton of which he accepted. 
   
  Owing to my role in the Whole arrangement, I had an agreement with the man to be receiving 18% of whatever gain is made on each Supply since he is to finance the transaction of which he agreed. But on the 20th August 2005, when the first supply of 120 cartons were made to the Alhaji Fofanah ,The man decided to renegade on our agreement. He refused to give me anything near the agreement we arrived at but gave me only what he termed an offer of appreciation. I decided to overlook this betrayal but since then our relationship has seized to be cordial. He never said anything to me again about Alhaji Fofanah.
   
  But recently, I visited Alhaji Fofanah he is requesting for supplies of 250 cartons of these substances following a suspected out break of disease among his cattle in Mali and Guinea. He has requested that these supplies be made before the mid August 2006. I convinced him that I can arrange for an international supplier who can supply him at the price of $ 4,600.00 USD per Carton. But that he Alhaji Fofanah or his representative will have to go to Europe and inspect it before lifting the goods. At the moment Alhaji Fofanah is waiting for me or my foreign contact.
   
  If you can handle this project, please contact me immediately for details on how to go about it and the negotiation on what is to be my commission. I am ready to give you Alhaji's contact for your direct conversation with him on the mode of payment method.
   
  Note: Alhaji Fofanah must not know our purchasing source in Europe or Asia. If not he will not be needing our services anymore. He will also paying advance before we supply him.
   
  Thank you.
  Yours Sincerely,

Boksburg South,
Johannesburg Province.
Republic of South Africa

Dear Sir,
RE: TRANSFER OF $ 26,000.000.00 USD
(ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR)

I am Dr Silver timi.the Auditor General of prime banks here South Africa, 
during the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an 
account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on 
this account again.
After going through some old files in the records I discovered that the 
owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and 
if I do not remit this money out urgently it will beforfeited for nothing.

Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach 
you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. 
However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be 
treated as such.

The owner of this account is Mr. Howard Sweeney, a foreigner, a miner and an 
industrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died misteriously .Since 
1993 no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it. My 
investigation proved to me that the account has no other beneficiary and 
that Mr. Howard Sweeney until his death was the manager Sweeney Coy.(pty). 
SA. We will start the first transfer with six million dollars 
[$6,000,000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your 
side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your 
account.

The amount involved is (USD 26M) Twenty six million United States Dollars 
only. I want to first transfer $6,000.000 [Six million United States Dollar] 
from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I 
don't know any foreigner.
I am revealing this to you with believein God that you will never let me 
down in this business. Also send your private telephone number and fax 
number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.

I need your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this 
business proposition. With my influence and the position of a bank official 
whom is working in our favour we can transfer this money to any foreigner's 
reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will 
be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.

The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we 
receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you 
can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make 
this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at 
least two days ahead of the money going into the account.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total 
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.
I look forward to your earliest response.

Best Regards,

Dr Silver Timi.

 the  assistance of my colleague, the money has been moved 
 out of  my bank and deposited in a finances company. It was 
 packed  in three(3)metal trunk boxes as photographic 
 materials. I  would need your particulars to enable me prepare 
 documents  which will authenticate that the Consignment belongs 
 to you  as the next of kin to MR. H .LEE and to enable you 
 claim  the money. I want to be assured of a safe account 
 where the  money will be deposited pending my arrival. This 
 transaction is absolutely risk free with no illegal 
 complications, I have made all necessary 
 arrangements for a  successful transaction. Before this money is 
 entrusted into  your care, there must be an agreement that will be 
 reached  between us stating that:

Dear Friend,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I
believe everyone will die someday,and am contacting you because i really
do need your help,and i want you to help me with all your effort and time
for just seven to fourteen workings days of your time.I want you to be
honest and truth full with me that you will help me with my last wish as a
dying man.

My name is Saeed Ahmed a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been
diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical
treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,according
to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for
anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was
never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this
as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make
all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has
called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my
immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to
give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the
last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some
charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my
health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and
distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in
Bulgaria and Pakistan,they refused and kept the money to themselves.
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with
what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of
Eighteen Million Dollars $18,000,000,00 in side two boxes that I have
with a Finance/Security Company Abroad. I will want you to Act as my
Beneficiary who will help me contact the security finance company on my
behalf to discuss the terms and condition of getting this deposit out from
thier custody and also helping me to dispatch it to the charity
organisations.

Reply to this email with your full names,contact address,tel number and
fax to enable me ask my doctors lawyer to arrange for you a power of
attorney that will give you full legal backing as my beneficiary.

I have set aside 30% for you and for your time.

Please kindly reply to my most confidential email if you are really
interested in helping me please:

saeedahmed631@yahoo.com

oo.comGod be with you.

Saeed Ahmed

Tel: 234 80 28176920
Contact: Mr Chris Ogiemwonyi  Group General Manager 
Email: chris4120@primposta.com
I am Mr Chris Ogiemwonyi a member of the Presidential
Payment Verification Committee (PPVC) of the Federal
Government of Nigeria, West Africa and also a Director
of Project Implementation with the NNPC. I am
presently on assignment with my colleagues in the
ministry of finance and the presidency carrying out
routine verification of contractual claims on behalf
of the NNPC 
I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a
Transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is
due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on
this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to
count on you, as a respected and honest person to
handle this transaction with sincerity, trust and
confidentiality.
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation
with you in the process of actualising our dreams
described hereunder. For the benefit of all parties
and hope you will keep it in confidence because of the
nature of this transaction within the NNPC and
Ministry of Finance (FMF), where I work as Director of
Project Implementation.
With the cooperation of four other top officials, we
have in our possession overdue payment bills which we
are presently verifying, to the tune of Twenty Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
(US$26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with
the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our
behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to
receive such funds. 
More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as
the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to
operate offshore account hence your importance in the
whole transaction. 
This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by a foreign
contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately in the course of our verification
exercise. Though the actual contract cost have been
paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance
in the tune of the said amount which we have in
principle gotten approval to remit by Key Tested
Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank
account you will provide by filing in an application
to NNPC and the Ministry of Finance for the transfer
of Rights and Privileges to the contractual sum to
you/your account. 
I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the
transaction, your share of the sum would be 30% of
the $26.5million, 60% for us, while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer, both locally and international expenses.. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with
utmost secrecy and confidentiality. 
Your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the
successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
would not disappoint me. 
Should you be interested or not in this transaction, 
please notify me through this private
email: chris4120@primposta.com
 or to call me with the tel number
above. If not also let us know, so as to enable us
enough time to scout for another credible foreign
partner or not to help carry out this transaction.
I assure you that my partners and I are in a position
to make the payment of this claim possible provided
you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee
that our share would be secured and please always
remember to treat this matter with the utmost
confidentiality, as any form of exposure would
compromise our positions in this government, being
active Government Civil Servants. 
Once again, remember time is of great essence in this
transaction. 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 
Yours faithfully,

ateeq khan <ateeq_khan11@plasa.com>,,"Thu, 14 Sep 2006 05:24:29 +0700",Essalamou aalaykoum ,"Dear Friend,

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I 
believe it is only a day that people meet and become great 
friends and business partners.

I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate 
affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I 
write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I 
can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to 
you.

I have an urgent and very confidential business 
proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign 
Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM 
CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) 
for 36 calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 
(Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in 
my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I 
was moved to my present position recently.

  Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as 
well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the 
maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his 
forwarding address but the letter was returned 
undelivered.

After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it 
was again returned and finally I discovered from his 
contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. 
Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand 
of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of 
his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of 
leaking information to the Americans. On further 
investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nassers family 
wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was 
the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or 
relation in all his official documents, including his Bank 
Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any
WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and 
placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank 
management since no one have heard from the owner since 
2003.

  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have 
made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am 
the only one that have the information.
With the recent change of government in my country and 
with their efforts to support the United Nations in 
checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this 
year, the government will pass a new financial control law 
which will give the government authority to interrogate 
account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the 
source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism 
support. If I do not move this money out of the country 
immediately, by end of the year the government will 
definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot 
provide the account owner to explain the source of the 
money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without 
the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting 
you for an assistance.

  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser, coupled with 
my present position and status in the bank as Head of 
Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the 
release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the 
next of kin to the account, with the correct information 
concerning the account, which I shall give you. All 
documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully 
worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the 
transaction will be executed under a legitimate 
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, 
beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.

If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you 
wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both 
parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact 
me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over 
the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless 
you.

Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send 
you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser 
when the deposit was made for your perusal.
I wait your urgent reply through my private emailaddress:

Regards,
Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.

PHONE +34 690 35 9947

Greeting,

This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person 
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know 
somebody either in physical or through correspondence that iswhy i am now 
in spain making this contart please  do call me on phone becaouse this is
very urgent business. 

I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of 
commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite 
astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to 
handle a financial business transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the 
traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of 
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00 
(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late 
father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as 
compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil 
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of 
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But 
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged 
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary 
status. The lodgment Security Code Number

was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable 
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a 
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this 
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money 
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment 
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the 
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your 
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had 
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is 
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when 
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I 
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss 
physically on Investment potentials. 

Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% 
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may 
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The 
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not 
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.

Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this 
matter. I will give you

all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully 
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the 
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me 
immediately so that I will look for another contact. 

I am waiting for your quick

response.

Yours faithfully

E-Mail, Address, hellenshakashaka@netscape.net


Dear Friend


You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am the first daughter of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.

 I got your contact through network online hence i decided to write you. Before the death of my father, he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$30 Million (thirty million United States dollars), in one of the  security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe,  introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. it is against this background that I and my family fled

Zimbabwe to South Africa for fear of our lives.

After which, I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying in the Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of European Union. As the eldest child of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.

The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries have similar political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the Consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.

But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in any of the country of your choice.  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.
I await your immediate reply and God bless.

Best regards,
Hellen Shaka Zuma

NOTE:
ON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM ME SO I CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

KENNETH MUGAJI. <kenmuga777@mail.az>,R@M,"Fri, 27 May 2005 18:45:11 -0700",IMPORTANT.,"Dear friend,
I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am Kenneth Mugaji, the first and
only surviving son of late David Mugaji one of the foremost and rich black
farmers in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.
Before the death of my father, he had given me the certificate of deposite
he used to deposit the sum of US$30.5 million (Thirty Million Five Hundred
United State Dollars) in one of the private fudiciary companies in the United

Kingdom,as family valuables, when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe.
This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals
for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in land.
This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform,
which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers 
(my father included).
This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and
the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe's war veterans,
under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is
against this background that I fled the country with my family, to where we are 
currently seeking asylum.
I have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the law here prohibits asylum seekers 
from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, 
hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust
the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family's survival 
depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.
There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 15% of the total
amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper
investment of the money in your country.
We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you.
I await your reply through the above media, while I implore you to
maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free
transaction.
I shall furnish you with more details on request.
Yours truly,
Kenneth Mugaji

Taking into considerations that we have not met before,l know this mail  although it's for good motive,may come to you as a surprise.l decided to contact you for this reason believing that you would be capable to work-out this deal for the interest of us based on what we have in the file here.
I am Dr, Mark Ibe,the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Eco Bank in west Africa with due respect and regard.I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 15th June 2004 in a Autho crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.
Although personally,I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution.The said amount was us$15M (fifteen million united states dollars). Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to contact a foreigner who will act as the next of kin to the deceased instead of the money going into the federal government coffers. I have contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confisicated or declared  unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged.Particularly,the Eco Bank Plc where the deceased had an account valued at about 15 million united states dollars has issued a notice for the next of kin to surface or have the account confisicated  within the next ten official working days.
since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 3 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased hence we claim this fund for our own benefits so that the proceeds of this account valued at 15 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement  that will protect you from any breach of the law.furnish me with the below information to enable the bank transfer the fund to your bank account.

FAX        002373361683

Greetings,

In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable 
source and the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself, I am 
John Kabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo President 
Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessed memory. 

;I know this letter might come to you as a surprise but I honestly have to 
solicit your attention to this assistance and foreingn investment. I write 
this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of  US $ 20 000,000.00
 with you. I inherited this funds from my mother. This funds was generated 
through the sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the 
head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege 
position to engage in the business of Diamond and timber since she knows
 that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the 
privilege situation.
When my father was assassinated on 16th January 01 by one of his 
bodyguards Lt. Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some Top Army 
officers that wanted to topple his government, I escaped to Cameroon 
because of the fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph 
Kabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are 
not in the best of relationship because of tussle for who among them 
will be the first lady and this ultimately affected us their children.

Considering the relationship between South Africa and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leave for 
Cameroon for security reason, while the funds were deposited with a 
security Company.

On getting to cameroon where I have been living since then 
 I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me 
in moving this funds out for safe banking and profitable foreighn 
investment. 
Honestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this funds in 
Cameroon nor Africa due to my status in my country as a result of my 
fathers death.
.And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this funds is all that I and my 
mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father's
assets and funds and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing 
that this funds was deposited at the security company. so this is why I 
decided that investing this funds abroad should be the best safest typy 
of adventure for me. I will be honoured if I can be given the privilege of 
investing this fund through your help.

In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough 
to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a 
hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your 
sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total fund and annual 
5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. 
Thereafter, the terms shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise 
during this transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive,When the fund 
($20,000,000.00) is moved into your discrete account, you will be 
allowed to draw 20% your favor, while the remaining 75% will be invested 
meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and 
deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends 
yeilding.
Should you for any reason not interested,please kindly reach me so as to
 make other contacts and please try  to keep this letter tight secret for the 
interest of my family.

Best regards.

There is an account opened in this bank in 1983 and since 1991 nobody has operated on this account again but all this came to light after an internal auditing that I conducted by going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out immediately it would be forfeited for no reason.The owner of this account is MR SMITH B. ANDREAS, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold co, a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involve!
 d is
 (US$26M) TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS.

I  am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account was MR SMITH B. ANDREAS. We will sign an agreement, but I assure you that it is real and a genuine business. Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone number and a fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement together so that we can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of our choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and other investments. 

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign account and  a foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. I have a correct information of this account, which I will give to you later, if you are able and willing to handle such an amount of money in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need a trustworthy person in this business because I dont want to make a mistake, I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreign reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.

You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. I will use my position and influence to effect the legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total amount 60% will be for me, and meanwhile 10% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest reply.

If my proposal is acceptable to you and you are willing to help me, please let me know so that you will enable me to  transfer the fund without any further delay or If there is anything beyond your understanding your welcome to e-mail or fax me on the number written above, because time is of essence.

prince duke <aa44@rt.nl>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Fri, 20 Sep 2002 01:45:22 -0700",urgent from duke,"FROM  DUKE

Greeting,

This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person 
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know 
somebody either in physical or through correspondence. 

I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of 
commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite 
astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to 
handle a financial business transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the 
traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of 
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00 
(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late 
father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as 
compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil 
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of 
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But 
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged 
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary 
status. The lodgment Security Code Number

was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable 
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a 
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this 
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money 
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment 
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the 
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your 
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had 
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is 
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when 
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I 
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss 
physically on Investment potentials. 

Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% 
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may 
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The 
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not 
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.

Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this 
matter. I will give you

all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully 
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the 
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me 
immediately so that I will look for another contact. 

I am waiting for your quick

response.

Good day and God bless,

Greetings to you in the name of God Almighty. I am former Mrs. Memunat Farouk Hasan, now I am Mrs. Rebecca Farouk Hasan a widow to Late Farouk Hasan Muhammad.

I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:(http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in BOMB ATTACK LONDON.

My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries.

This mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently
relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $7,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country, and i have map out $1,700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work. 

Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped.

Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity.

I await your reply.

the bank in 1998 and since 2002 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in my 
records,I discovered that my late client died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit

who lost his life along with his family members leaving nobody as next of kin.

investigation proved to me as well that the account is a secret account. The total amount involved is Nine Million 
Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only [$9,700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money into a safe 
foreigners account abroad,but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money

thomas sarr <thomasarr37@yahoo.co.uk>,R@M,"Wed, 02 Mar 2005 00:26:28 +0100",A plea for assistance!!!,"Dear friend,


I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY 
FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN
CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
AND USE. 

I am MR. Thomas Sarr, the manager of bill and exchange
at the foreign remittance department of my  Bank. In
my department I discovered an abandoned sum of
US$8.5m,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US  
Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs
to one of our  foreign customers who died along with
his wife and only daughter in a plane 
crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which
crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about
the crash on visiting this site  
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/
The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an
American and great industrialist and a resident of
Alaska. 

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided
to make this business proposal to you and for our bank
to release the money to you. You have to follow the
instructions which I will send to you as the next of
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it
and I don't want this money to go into 
our bank treasury as  unclaimed  bill. 

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if
such money remained unclaimed after three years, the 
money will be transfered into the bank treasury as
unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than 
three years and I am preparing documentations to prove
that this money has been transfered to our bank
treasury. It will be between me and you only that will
know that the money is not transfered into our
treasury. The request of foreigner as next of kin in
this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the
customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand
as next of kin to a foreigner. 

In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you
30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of
transfer/other charges) likely to  be incurred during
the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% 
is  for me. 

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax
or email the text of the application which you will
complete and forward to our bank asking for this money
to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris
Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that
this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not
entertain any fear as all required arrangements have
been made for the transfer. You should contact me
immediately as soon as you receive this mail through
the above email.
  
PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY.
PLEASE DO CONSIDER MY REQUEST AS URGENT. 

You may contact me also at sarrthom1@lycos.com.

 FROM:MRS.MCKNIGHT LUCY,

THE WIFE OF LATE CHIEF FREDRICK MCKNIGHT,

FORMER POPULAR BLACK FARMER IN ZIMBABWE.


Dear Friend.

With due respect, trust and humility I write this
Letter to you seeking your help and assistance though
Its difficult since we have not met before. 

I got your good contact from the Zimbabwean
Information Exchange(ZIE) regarding your business
profile and Sincerity, I believe that you are capable
and reliable in assisting this my urgent request. I am
Mrs. BUSISIWE LUCY MCKNIGHT, the wife of LATE FREDRICK
MCKNIGHT, the former popular black farmer in Zimbabwe
who is also a Famous politician, in the Zimbabwe
political arena. My husband was assonated by president
Mugabe and his men because he (my husband)refusal to
agree with the so called president to take the lands/farms 
of the whites who contribute to make the country what it is today.
Because of my husbands sincerity he was constantly briefing the press 
on what is going wrong in the country and the autocratic government of
Mugabe.He was assassinated on 23 November 2001 being Sunday by 8.45 in Harare, 
in Western  province of Zimbabwe, the planners of the assassination are well
know by the masses. 

My dear when this incident occurred at about 8.45 in Zimbabwe time, my husband 
did not die on the spotrather he was rushed to Harare hospital where he later died. 
Before the death of my husband, he had taken me and our son to South Africa to 
deposit the sum of US$32.5 million {Thirty two million five hundred thousand dollars} in a
security company . And now I am in Zimbabwe but my son is in South Africa 
with the money deposited in asecurity company with the documents intact. Because of
the country existing law, which bears asylum seekers/refugee like him 
(my son) and also hisage not to operate an account that exceed US$2000.00
and the fear of the South African government not raising  eyebrows about the
money therein South Africa, I decided to write to you seek for your help 
for this money tobe transferred into your private bank account as all
arrangements for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care off.
And also due to my presentcondition here in Zimbabwe, Mugabe and his allied have
deride me the right of traveling outside the country, I am having a deadly 
cancer ofthe breast which make me to be worried to see that
this money is in a safe hand before anything happened to me, it is the 
only thing left for the upbringing of my children whom are still young before my
husband left me. I want to assure you also that this 
transaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this 
apart from my first Son Samuel and I. Dear, as for your rewarding kind 
assistance I have resolved to give you 20% of the total amount, while 5% have 
been mapped out for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this
transaction. We planned to invest the rest of the money in your country under 
your guidance.If you are willing to assist us try as much as possible to write 
me so I also inform my son about my negotiations with you.

Dear, bear in mind that our lives and future of my
children depend on this fund and we do hope that this
money will be safe, when finally transferred into your account. I do hope of 
establishing a rewarding and good relationship with you and your
family after this transaction. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. 
Please I would likeyou to keep this transaction highly confidential and secret 
considering my sons position in South Africa. I have already brief my son 
immediately you,if  you  receive this mail kindly contact him.

This is his phone number +27-835266638,I am waiting to
hear from you soon.



Thanks for your understanding and God bless you.

From: Mr. Samuel lantey.
Accra, Ghana. 
 
Dearest: 
 
I got your contact during my search for a reliable,honest and a 
trust worth person to entrust this huge transfer project with.
My name is Mr.Samuel lantey .
I am a Ghaniaian married with two kids. 
I am writing to solicit your assistance in the transfer of 
$4,550.000.00 million U.S dollars only,equivalent to 2.5 million pounds.
 
This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the manager
made as profit during the 2004 financial year. I have already submitted 
annual report for that year to my head office here in Accra as I have 
watched with keen interest as they will never know of this excess.
I have since, placed this amount of $4,550.000.00 million U.S dollars on
an Escrow Coded account without a beneficiary (anonymous) to avoid trace. 
As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus 
I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your
bank account on my behalf. 
 
I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need 
to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. It's going to be
a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as the original 
depositor of this fund so that the fund can be transferred to your account.
If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response to my 
private email samuel_lantey01@latinmail.com

Victoria Garden City
Marine Beach.

Date: 4th October, 2003.

Attention:

Dear Sir,

PRAISE GOD, THE MOST BENEVOLENT. 

I am Mrs. Victoria Bucknor,named person from Nigeria. I am married to Late Mr. George Bucknor of blessed memory who worked with Nigeria embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in the year 2000. 

We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted christain.Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5Million (Five Million U.S. Dollars) in a security company. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. 

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three  months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a church/organisation or devoted christain individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here- in. I want this church/organisation or individual to use this money in all sincererity to
fund building church,orphanages,widows and also propagating the word of GOD and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy
bible. 

The holy bible emphasized so much on GOD benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I  don�t have any child that will inherit this money, and I don�t want my husband�s hard earned money to be misused by people I call unbelievers. I don�t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with GOD the most benevolent and the most merciful. I don�t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also of the presence of my husband�s relatives around me always. 

I don�t want them to know about this development. With GOD all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply, I will forward it to my family attorney and I will then instruct him to give you the contact of the
Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the christains/Muslims communities where you reside to always pray for me. 

My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted christain worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve the GOD must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church/organisation or a devoted christain for this same purpose. 

Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders. 

May the almighty GOD continue to guide and protect you. 

Regards, 

Mrs. Victoria Bucknor

I know you will be surprised to read a letter from me but please 
Consider this as a request from a family in dare need of assistance. I am the 
wife of late Brigadier AL-Jubril Zubairu from Dafur Region, Sudan. My name 
is Hajia Rakiya Zubairu Writing to you from Sudan.
My son got your contact information from a business directory in 
Dakar Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And I on behalf of my late 
husband and my only son, decided to solicit for your assistance to 
transfer the sum of US$9 million dollars, from my late husband's trust 
account  with a bank in Senegal, into your company or Private bank 
account.
Before the death of my husband, he was a Brigadier in-charge of Arms 
and ammunition procurement for the Darfur Liberation Front (D. L. F.). In 
his will, he specifically drew my son's attention to the sum of US$9 
million, which he had deposited, in the vault of a Bank in Dakar Senegal , 
 as a family treasure, but it is truly cash while he boxed in it
the bank as a family treasure due to security reasons.
In fact, he said and I quote ?�my beloved son, I wish to draw your 
attention to the sum of US$9 million. I deposited the said fund in a 
private account of a Bank in Dakar , Senegal; all the documents 
regarding the fund are with your mother.
I was very dedicated and committed to wining the ongoing war against 
the rebels until when I found out that some senior army officers and 
government functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds 
and properties, sending them to foreign countries. Due to this, when I 
and former special adviser to the President were assigned by the 
President (Hassan al-Bashir) to purchase arms in South Africa, we saw this as 
an opportunity to divert the money for our personal use.
When we divided the money, my share was US$9 million. I did this in 
case of my absence due to death so that you, Abubakar your two sisters and 
your mother wouldn't suffer. Take my advice my son; and please be 
serious with your Studies, I will like you to please take care
of this money properly for your future and of your mother's and sisters
You should solicit for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign 
partner to assist you to transfer this money out of DAKAR for 
investment. I deposited the money in your name and you alone with the 
deposit code, for you to claim it. Your mother is with all the documents; 
take good care of your mother and your two sisters. Do not disappoint 
me! Good-bye.
>From this word of my late husband, you will understand that the lives 
and future of my family depend on this fund as such I will be grateful 
if you can assist us. Now what I want you to do for us is to help us 
clear this sum from the bank using your name which should be as the

ISA MOHAMMED <isa_m87@tiscali.co.uk>,,,GOOD DAY FRIEND,"CHALLENGE SECURITIES  AND FINANCE LTD
LAGOS, NIGERIA


ATTENTION:SIR

I am MR.ISA MUHAMEED, the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.I have resolved to contact you through this
medium based on business proposal that will be of
mutual benefit to both of us.

I got your particulars through a consultant company
base on my research for atrustworthy and established
person that understands investment ethic for entering
into a life time profitable joint partnership
investment and also co-operation with confidence and
trust that you willkeep the contents secret and
divulged to any third party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited
aconsignment in our company\\'s vault for safe
keeping.And since then our client has failed to come
forward to claim his consignment, which has
accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in
demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this
client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment
had accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since
the death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,
none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the
consignment with us, which means that non of his
relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment.
Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the
two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. And
to my surprise I discovered that the two boxes that
were registered as treasurer by our client actually
contained a considerable amount of money in United
States Dollars amounting to about US$30 million
Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing
plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and
the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot
of money from his country while he was in office as
head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment
in our vault was part of the money that our client
siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to
this money in our care.I am now soliciting your noble
assistance to assist me in transferring this money out
of nigeria to your country for immediate investment
with your assistance.I have also decided that you will
generously been titled to 30% of the total amount.
Upon my receiptof your reply confirming your
willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will
immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of
ownership of this consignment to your name to
facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the
complete funds to yourcountry.
you have nothing to worry about, as I will be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintain
absolute confidentiality on this matter.
Please reply to the above email address with your
telephone and fax so can call you.
Thanks.
Yours faithfully.
MR.ISA MUHAMEED

An application for funds transfer shall be made at the appropriate ministries in favour of the beneficiary (you or your company). Thereafter, your company shall be officially regarded as having executed the contract for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for which payment is being made. This process makes the operation legal according to the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Please treat this transaction as strictly confidential,as we are civil servants who are not entitled to operate a foreign account.

Yetunde Bassey <yetunde@mail2world.com>,yetunde@mail2world.com,"Sun, 14 Sep 2003 05:21:48 -0700",PROJECT INTEREST.,"My dear friend, 

I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos
Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for
you. 

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an 
automobile accident. 

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a
WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I
therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the
money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of
this old
manÃfÆ'Ã?â?TÃfâ?sÃ,Â¢ÃfÆ'Ã,Â¢ÃfÂ¢Ã¢â?sÂ¬Ã.Â¡Ãfâ?sÃ,Â¬ÃfÆ'Ã,Â¢ÃfÂ¢Ã¢â?sÂ¬
Ã.Â¾Ãfâ?sÃ,Â¢s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt
government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names
and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall
employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us
to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for
settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds
arrive your country. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,
please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email
addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look
forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

DR. Yetunde Bassey

FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT
CREDIT BANK BENIN
COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC
WEST AFRICA.
DIRECT CONTACT:
+229 97 87 30 79

ALTERNATIVE EMAIL:peter_adams3010@yahoo.it

My dear  
,

I am MR PETER ADAMS, the director in charge of auditing and 
accounting section of Credit Bank Benin republic in West Africa with 
due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business 
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of 
the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, 
my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a 
deceased person who died on 30th january 2000 on Kenya Airways with 
aircraft Airbus 310-304 at location Abidjan, Ivory Coast,  with 
registration number 5Y-BEN while travelling with his entire family, his 
wife, two children and a maid on a festive visit to Abidjan and since 
his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this 
Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his 
family or relation before our discovery to this development.

Although 
personally, I kept this information secret within myself and partners 
to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during 
the time of execution. The said amount was (USD$24.1M)Twenty four 
Million one Hundred Thousand united states dollars As it may interest 
you to know, I got your impressive information through my good friend 
who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here 
in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your person to me to be 
viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any 
problem.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this 
fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased and get the required 
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in 
place, all directives and needed information will be relayed to you as 
soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and 
also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity.

In fact i 
could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the 
time of transfer because i work in this bank.

This is the actual 
reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward 
claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and  clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted 
from to your own designated bank account.

May i at this point 
emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as i have made all 
arrangements for a successful transaction as an insider of the bank 
before contacting you.

On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you 
will be entitled to 30%of the total sum as gratification, while 10% 
will be set aside to take care of any expenses that may arise during 
the time of transfer like telephone bills, fax and our travel tickets 
to come over to your country for the sharing of the fund while 60% will 
be for me and my partners.

Please you have been advised to keep this a 
top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service 
after we conclude this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole 
situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account 
and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the 
fund according to percentages previously indicated and further 
investment either in your country or any country you will advice us to 
invest in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you on your 
acceptance to champion this transaction with me. I suggest you get back 
to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.

For 
confidentiality reasons,kindly call me on my direct line and also reply 
to my private 

Email:peter_adams3010@yahoo.it

Yours Faithfully,

Good day. My name is Momoni Adoh . I am the regional manager of International Commercial Bank Takoradi branch eastern region of the Republic of Ghana (West Africa). I write you this letter in good faith. I got your contact address from a recent banking forum held in Lome the capital city of Togo our next door neighbor, hence I write you to ask for your assistance in a business venture that will benefit you and I.
 
On January of 2000, one Mr. Dennis Burles who has been living and working in a gold company called Obuasi Goldfields died in the Kenya airways fatal air crash on the coast of Cote D Ivorie on its way to Accra  the capital city of Ghana.
 
I was the personal banker to the late Mr. Burles, before his untimely death. You see my friend, the late Mr. Burles had $3M USD deposited in a fixed deposit account in my branch, without any next of kin to inherit the sum, that is the reason I write you this letter. I need you to stand claim as the next of kin so that my bank will not declare this funds a deceased account non-grata, meaning that the bank has full and legal right to claim the funds, since the policy of the bank on deceased customer account is that after 5 years if there is no claim, the funds will be immediately taken by the bank. 
 
Frankly speaking I have been working in this bank for close to 10 years and I have nothing to show for it, my yearly income is barely about $2,500 USD after tax and the major reason I packaged this transaction is that I have a 9 year old daughter with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die. I have already made arrangement for this surgery in the UK but I could not afford it, so I really need your help to do this deal or my daughter will die. I am offering you 25% of the total sum after this money is wired to your account, because it is a simple bank-to-bank inheritance claim payment transfer. I will also like you to get me rest assured that you will not abandon me when the money gets to your account. You can reach me on tell: +233 244231712, I have all the payment claim information worked out. Bye for now and thanks for your understanding.

MARY ABASS <mary_abass2@123.com>,mary_abass2@123.com,,MY WILL.,"My Lordship, 
 
Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am former Mrs. Fatima Abass Yakubu Idris now Mrs Mary Abass Yakubu Idris, a widow to Late Sheik Abass Yakubu Idris.
 
I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage.
 
My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this. 
 
So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the development of evangelism in Africa,which is in my place,America Europe and Asian Countries.This mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Nigeria, Africa where I live presently. 
 
I selected you and your church after visiting the website for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $2,200,000.00 Million US Dollars to your Church/Ministry for the development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around you.
 
Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in Europe and the company has branches,therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use,than enhancement of evangelism. 
 
Lastly, I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity.If you have to die says The Lord, keep fit and I will give you the whole of my life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you.
 
I awaits your urgent reply.
 
YOURS IN CHRIST, 
SISTER MARY ABASS IDRIS.

Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.  I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication. Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com ) Thanks and regards. TONY SMITH N.B Reply me only on this my alternative email ttss7520062006@mixmail.com",0,1

For your kind attention


Good-day,


you may be surprised to receive this letter from me, but it is a matter
that I am convinced we can solve both, if we work together in harmony.
However, I seek for your absolute confidence as I introduce myself to you.
My name is AHMED HASSAN, Assistant Auditor OFFSHORE FINANCE HOME, DUBAI
U.A.E.


In the discharge of my duty as the Assistant Auditor, I stumbled on this
domiciliary account that has remained dormant for three years now with Ten
million six hundred US dollars (US$10.6m) in it. I contacted my directors
and we sent out staff for enquiries about this fund and discovered that
the account holder died in an accident. I am writing you so that we can
work together to remit the money to you as the next of kin because this
money belongs to a foreigner and has to be claimed by a foreigner.


I guarantee this transaction under legitimate arrangements that will not
bridge the law by both parties. I have options to offer you, first you can
choose to have certain percentage of the money for your assistance, or you
can go into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the money.
Which ever option you choose, feel free to notify me. If for some reasons
you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the
money.


Note, on the event that you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you
to still keep my contact and existence of this fund a secret. I also
require you make available to me your confidential telephone and fax
numbers to enable me communicate with you easily. It is simple process
which will take a short while to process.


To indicate your interest to work with us, I will give you more detailed
information regarding on what to do and how to do it for us to achieve
good success about the transaction as soon as I hear from you. Please
reply to my private email address: akabir1696@hotmail.com

TEL:27 835 067 386,

Dear Sir,

In order to transfer out (US$12 Million) Twelve Million United States
Dollars from ABSA .I have picked-up the trust and courage to write you
this letter with divine confidence that you are a reliable and honest
person who will be capable for this important business transaction
 believing also that you will never let me down either now or in the
future.

My name is Mr. Jeffrey Daniels a senior Auditing Officer with
the ABSA Bank in South Africa.There is an account opened in this bank
in
1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After
going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do
not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account died since 1990. No other person knows about
this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this
company
does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is
(US$12 million)Twelve million United States Dollars.I want to transfer
this sum of Twelve  million United States Dollars into a safe foreign
account abroad.I am contacting you based on the fact that you are a
foreigner because this money can only be approved for payment to a
foreigner, more so it can not be approved by any local bank here, as
this
money is in US Dollars hence the former owner of this account is a
foreigner too.
I know that this proposal will come to you as a surprise as we don't
know ourselves before. however I got your contact from an inter net
consultant here in South Africa, though I did not disclose the
purpose of
my seeking for a foreign business partner to him.
Although we will still have to meet possibly, sign some agreement
before the final transfer of the fund into any of your chosen
designated bank account. I have involved a very senior official in the
operational department and we have agreed that after the transfer of
the
money into your account, you shall be entitled to 25% of the total
sum,
we the officials will take 70% while 5% is for expenses.

All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a risk free
situation on the side of both parties.
 Please note that this deal can only take place on the following
 conditions:-
1.You will provide the bank account and other relevant
particulars/information for easy and onward Remittance
of this money.
2.Absolute confidentiality and sincerity will be
required and guaranteed, considering our (me and my
partners) positions in the bank.
3.Assurance that our own due share will be released to
us in good faith when this money finally gets into
your account.

All things being equal, this transaction will be within 10 working
days
as soon as we hear from you.
Please treat with utmost confidentiality. Contact me as quickly as
possible through my e-mail box,or above telephone number.

Expecting your urgent response,

Best Regards,

Mr. Jeffrey Daniels

Dear,

I am Dr. M. Tutu, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural
Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a
confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a
top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars, which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual
to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company
account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the
circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.

This amount Twenty-Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand represents the
balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the
original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic
Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in
an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence
provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send
across to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%
of the (Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars).70% for
us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to
the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence
in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me
immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether
or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure
you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of
this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this
matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and
remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Dr. M. Tutu

Nigeria.In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating
funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this
financial quarter.

The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime,
government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to 
Contractors.The present civilian government set up the Contract Review
Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made
available to it by the decree setting up the panel,  to review these
contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.

My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which 
are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for
disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and  members of
this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of
companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a 
matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable
overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of
U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars).
That is why I am writing you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,
if you agree with our proposition as follows;

(i) 10% to the account owner (you).

(ii) 80% for us (the panel officials).

(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us
)incidental to the actualisation of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign
stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have
access to them. Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and
risk-free.We intend to effect the transfer within a few days from the
date of receipt of the following information:

Your name, companys name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and
your banking information. The above information will enable us write
letters of claim andjob description respectively. This way, we will use
your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the  award of
the contract to your company.

We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit
for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge
the receipt of this letter and, I will bring you into a more detailed
picture of this transaction when I hear from you.

Best regards,
Dr. Williams Banigo

Sandra White <sandrawhite19@ace-mail.com>,,"Thu, 28 Dec 2006 12:31:21 +0200",IT IS WELL WITH YOU.,"--Dear Beloved in Christ,Please bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it as I know we don\\'t know each other.It\\'s my belief that I am doing the lord\\'s bidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the courage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I will need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and unbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I trust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in my heart.It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth; I had no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and glory upon my life.I am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an expatriate Contractor with Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$7.5 Million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in a 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, this money(with accrued interest) is still with the Bank and the management just wrote me as the next of Kin/beneficiary to the account that it has become DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the completion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not re-activate the account; the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my condition(note that you need to activate this account) as I can not come over. Presently, I\\'m in a hospital in Kenya (I chose to remain here since I will die closer to nature and the lord) where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the World that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth here in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an orphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this responsibility to any one of them any more. I feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or you are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open your heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why would a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and be offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA except, that I know that the lord\\'s way are not our ways. I have come to conclude that\\'s it\\'s divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by his breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty of his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become very clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you are chosen for this, you other than someone else. It\\'s all part of the big picture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend forever............Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my husbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going to. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. {Exodus14 VS14} says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not communicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my husband\\'s wealth and not my health.With God all things are possible.

Raad Ibrahim <raad004@netscape.net>,R@E,"Sun, 08 Aug 2004 19:50:13 +0000",URGENT ASSISTANCE.,"Dear friend,

It is indeed my pleasure to write to you this letter,
which I believe will be a suprise,as we are both
complete strangers. As you read this,I don't want you
to feel sorry for me, because I believe everyone will
die someday. My name is Raad Ibrahim, a former
merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.(United Arab
Emirates), I have been diagnosed with Esophageal
cancer which was discovered very late, due to my
laxity in caring for my health.

It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I
have only about a few months to live, according to
medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life
so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even
myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was
never generous, I was always hostile to people and
only focus on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for, but now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world.

I believe when I have a second chance to come to this
world I would live my life a different way from how I
had lived it, now that it is dark for me, I have
willed and given most of my properties and assets to
my immediate and extended family members and as well
as a few close friends. To correct my wrong past life, 
I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, 
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on 
earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now
that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do
this my self anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my
accounts and distribute the money which I have there
to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they
refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do
not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be
contended with what I have left for them. The last of
my money which no one knows of is the huge cash
deposit of 15,000,000 million dollars, (fifteen
million dollars), that I have with a Fiducial Company
in Europe I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and
you must be sending me information of how it was
disbursed either by email to:raadibrahim004@netscape.net 
or otherwise.
 
10% of the funds(15 million), will be for your time and patience,
logistics and overhead.

I wait in anticipation for your response.

Thanks,

Raad Ibrahim.

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.

Attention Please,

I am Musa Garuba, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section 
of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. 
With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business 
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the 
transaction .

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank 
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this development.

The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand 
United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your 
impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole 
arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the 
deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign 
account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be 
relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to 
assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from 
to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and 
internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have 
been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when 
I hear from you.

I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,

Yours faithfully,

Musa Garuba.

MR.YARO BAMIYI <doomer@themail.com>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Wed, 12 Feb 2003 08:17:38 -0800",LOOKING FOR TRUSTED PARTNER,"

ATTN: Sir/Madam.
                                                      
                  

My name is MR YARO BAMIYI, the eldest son of Rtd
General
BUBA S.G.BAMIYI, who was the estwhile Minister
of the Federal Capital territory Abuja in thelate
General Sani Abachas Regime of 1993-1998.I am
contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost
confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution
to a money transfer of $25M that is presently putting
my entire family into great disarray. 

You may be quite surprised at my sudden contact to you
but do not despair, I got your contact from a business
site on the internet and following the information I
gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be
of assistance to me. So,I decided to contact you at
once due to the urgency required for us to immediately
transfer the said funds out of the country.

During the time my father was in the government with
the late General Sani Abacha as the head of state,they
were both involved in several deals that yielded
Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the deals
was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the
importation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the
Nigerian Defense, funds set to embark on an oversea
ampaign to counter the United States action to put a
stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha
government to retain power, and monies set aside to
rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries
and the National Electric Power Authority which
supplies Electricity to the entire nation. If you are
conversant with world news, you would understand
better.

During this period my father was able to make some
good money for himself and kept in his private bank
accounts. The then head of state General Sani Abacha
transferred his share of the money through a Lebanese
businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman, Mark
Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all
the secrets were revealed by the investigation
agencies set up by the successive governments and most
of the Abacha?s loots were traced and repatriated
fromthe various accounts to the Federal Government
Treasury.

Out of the money my father made, he left the sum of
N50 Million (Fifty Million Naira) in the CBN escrow
account for further transfer into a foreign account
and a sum of $25M (TWENTY-FIVE Million Dollars) was
kept in a Private security firm here in Nigeria.
Through the confessions made by the Abacha?s Family,
the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating
agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to
discover the $25M, which he kept in the vaults. The
reason is because no names were used to lodge in the
funds.Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS
(PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and
Treasury Bills. Also the firm issued him with a
certificate of deposit of the consignments. Note thatI
have these information in my custody.

Right now, my father has been arrested and detained
for interrogation. As the eldest son of my Father, I
believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to
ensure that the $25M is successfully transferred
abroad for investment purposes. With the present
situation, I cannot do it all by myself. 

It is based on this that I am making this contact with
you. I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned
the best wayto create you as the beneficiary to the
funds and effect the transfer accordingly. Is rest
assured that the modalities I have resolved to
finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and
the successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be
absolutely right when you say that this project is
risk free and viable. If you are capable and willing
to assist,contact me at once via email for more
details.

Believe me, there is no one else we can trust gain.All
my fathers friends have deserted us after exploiting
us on the pretence of trying to help my father. As it
is said, ""it is at the time of problems that you know
your true friends"". So long as you keep everything to
yourself, we would definitely have no problems. For
your assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20%
of the total funds after transfer and invest a
reasonable percentage into any viable business you may
suggest.

Please, I need your assistance to make this happen and
please; do not undermine it because it will also be
asource of up liftment to you also. You have
absolutely nothing to loose in assisting us
instead,you have so much to gain.



Awaiting your urgent and positive response.
Best Regards 

MR.YARO BAMIYI.

Dear Friend,
Request for assistance: Strictly Confidential 

I am Engr: Abubakar Saeed, the director of works FMW&H Nigeria and chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of ultinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H). The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$17,000,000.00 (seventeen million united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. 
Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the Central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction  the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary.

Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career dented. 
This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by  you sending me a mail through my confidential email address so that I can brief you further (abu_saeed4@tiscali.co.uk).

I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our home work properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service,which we intend to retire from.  
kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the first quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.

Thanks and God bless.

Goodday 
Sir/Madam

I am a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank 
accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. 
It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's 
Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. 
These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). 
Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in 
the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December, 
1999. 
The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe 
deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on 
accounts that were interest bearing when established. The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts 
due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 20,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was 
discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. 
The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit 
balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died 
interstate (living no wills). 
Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds 
without any hitch.we can share the funds and use in investment of our 
choice. 
Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me 
with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you. 
Kindly provide me with your full name, address,date of birth and telephone/fax. We will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is 
transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name in Spain, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and 
transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total 
amount. 

You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites: 
www.swissbankclaims.com

www.avotaynu.com 
www.icheic.org 
www.livingheirs.com

I find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks. 
Thank you for your prompt response. 
You can write me in German if you wish

FROM THE DESK OF RAJI RAJI
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  (ADB)
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.

Dear Friend,

How are you,first i will explain my self little to youbefore we continue. I 
am the manager of bill and
exchange at the foreign remittance department ofAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 
(ADB)I am writing to seekyour interest over a transaction.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of$15m US dollars (FIFTEEN 
MILLIONS US DOLLARS) . In anaccount that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer
who died along with his entire family in November 2002  in a plane crash. 
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin   or relation died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one orther official in my 
department have decided to make this business proposal to you and release 
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety 
and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want 
this money to go into the Bank's treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank's 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannotstand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a
foreign account,  10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the 
business and 50 % would be for me and my colleague. There after I will visit 
your country for disbursement of the fund according to the percentages 
indicated in this proposal. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of 
this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations 
or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account 
number, your private
telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location 
where in the money will beremitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of the 
application. I will not fail to
bring to your notice that this transaction  is hitch free and that you 
should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.


Trusting to hear from you immediately.


Yours faithfully RAJI RAJI
Bill and Exchange Manager,
Africa Development Bank (A.D.B)

Greetings in the name of God. Please let this not sound strange to you. I am 
deaf and suffering from a long time cancer of the bream! set which also 
affected my brain, from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating 
and it is quite obvious that according to my doctors they have advised me 
that I may not live for the next six months, this is because the cancer 
stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I was brought upfrom a motherless 
baby&#65533;s home, married to my late husband for twenty years without a 
child. My husband died in a fatal motor accident.Before his death we were 
true Christians.

Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited 
belongings and deposited the sum of US$3 million dollars with a Security 
Company here in Abidjan. Presently this money is still with them and the 
management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the 
money or issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my 
behalf since I can not come over because of my illness. Presently I'm with 
my lap top in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer 
of the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told 
me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that 
this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed 
each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless 
baby&#65533;s home where I come from. I want you God fearing to also use 
this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows.

If you are interested, please respond back to my proposal so that I will 
give you security firm contact, They will issue you the letter of authority

Dear
I salute you in the name of the most High! My name is Mrs. Rose Ameeraly.

Am a widow and a mother of two girls. We do not know each other and I'm wondering how you will view this letter. Please, accept my sincere apology. Sorry, about taking your time as well. I will be highly obliged if you can assist me in this business. My Husband is an Nigerian while I am a Ghanaian. My late husband, David Ameeraly, was a loving, caring and hardworking businessman. Prior to his death by plane crash, he was living with us in Accra, Ghana. He died November 1st 1990. This sad event occurred during one of his business trips to the US. Please, find below the website for more information. If you go through this publication critically, you will find my husband's name, David Ameeraly amongst others that lost their life on that fateful day as published by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stmB
Before the sudden death of my beloved husband, he planned to establish a business in Europe with the sum of US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars only). Unfortunately, he died before this venture could materialize. Following his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled to his properties (assets and money).

Since I am a woman and my offsprings are all girls coupled with the fact that I do not have a male child, I was put under terrible pressure to stay clear from my legitimate husband estates According to their family culture/traditional believe, a woman is not allowed to run late
husband business and worst of all, I was asked to move into David's younger brother's household as one of his wives. My problem started when I refused to be inherited by David's younger brother. Fortunately,  the proposed investment fund US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars only). that was deposited with the investment/security company was unknown to the family. As such, they did not ask for this. If not, it would have been a problem as there would have been nothing to fall back on. It's only our lawyer & my humble self that know of this fund. I have discussed this matter with the Finance company were the fund was lodged. This is the asset I have left and I need part of this money for my daughters school fees and to maintain my personal life as well. David's family was vehemently against my daughters education. All they intend doing,
was to give them out for marriage at a tender age. According to the staff of the finance company, the best way to secure this money is to transfer this money into an alternative bank account for safekeeping.

Later it will be used for business investment which is subject to the advise of whoever that will be assisting us finally.
For obvious reasons, I do not want the finance company's involvement.
This transaction must be handled under strict confidentiality. At this juncture, I thought it wise to solicit your indispensable assistance to receiving this fund on my behalf. I do not have knowledge of funds management & business in general. I was a full-time housewife.
Therefore, this step depends on your trust-worthiness & ability to handle funds of this magnitude. All that is required of you, is to forward to me by email, your direct phone, fax, address or any other information you may deem helpful. I need the requested information for the purpose of securing the relevant documents in your name as my confidante/ bona fide beneficiary. Please, note that this transaction is legitimate and 100% hitch-free. We will not violate any known law of my country and that of yours. So, be rest-assured.
However, as soon as I receive your positive response to the above business transaction, I shall provide you with necessary transfer details. Note also, that you must convince me of your trust-worthiness and ability to keep secret. I have decided to compensate you with 30%
of the total money as a reward for your sincere assistance and the remaining 70% will be used to pursue my late husband's investment dream in real estate.
Thanking you for your anticipated response as I look forward to hearing
from you.
I remain.
Sincerely yours,
Mrs.Rose David Ameeraly

got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from
his contract employers, that Mr. Dixit Shanti died in the 1988 Lockerbie 
flight Pan Am 103 plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he 
died intestate (without making a WILL), and all attempts to trace his 
next-of-kin had been fruitless.Please see
http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/5260/passlist.html
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dixit 
Shanti did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents with
us, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$49,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to 
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Dixit Shanti.
This is simple, I will like you to provide your full names and home or
office including your telephone and fax numbers so that I can seek the
services of a lawyer/Attorney to prepare the necessary documents and
court affidavits which will put you in good standing as the 
next-of-kin.
A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide later 
will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the 
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the 
ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.
Be informed that in other to provide more legality and legitimacy to 
this project, the paperworks for this will be done by the Attorney and my 
position as the head of bills and exchange guarantees the successful execution 
of this transaction. If you are interested, please
revert back to me.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.If you are capable and intrested to do this business with me you reply me in this my email address: usmanramat1@web-mail.com.ar
Thanks and regards.

oversea account ($16,700.000.00 USD) Sixteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) from one of the banks located in Dakar Senegal. I
want to ask you, If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and
honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank
account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even
an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain
honest to me till the end of this important business ,I am trusting in you

I am Mr Philip Tarila. a personal assiatant to late Andreas Schranner.
During the course of his bank's last week auditing,it was discovered that
since his death no one has come forward to lay claim to this funds.So the
bank issued me a memo to provide his next of kin or forfeith the funds. This
account was opened with the bank in 1999 and since 2000 nobody has operated
on this account again, after going through some old files in my records,I
discovered that my late client  died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money
is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be
forfeited for nothing.
The owner of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a German property magnate
who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of AF4590 German Concorde
which crahsed on July 25th 2000,including his family leaving nobody as next
of kin.
No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that the account is a secret account.

The total amount involved is Sixteen million Seven Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars only [$16, 700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money
into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I don't know any foreigner, I am
only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information about the
account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I am
revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the

During the current war between the government forces and the rebel I was sent to South Africa on a diplomatic mission to negotiate purchasing of arms and ammunition worth of US$22M(Twenty Two Million United State Dollars) for fighting of the government forces in Angola but on my middle of negotiation with a private South African arms company here in Johannesburg, I was informed that my rebel leader late (Mr. Jonas Savimbi) was assassinated by the government forces in Angola and the US$22M was sealed in a consignment before sending it to South Africa through a diplomatic channel.
   After the death of my rebel leader, I decided to divert the fund to a private security and finance company here in South Africa for safe keeping of the fund but on my deposition the consignment/fund I did not disclose the content of the consignment/fund to the security company for security reasons because no rebel official was aware that my late rebel leader sent me on this mission before his death.

- Dear friend,My name is Mrs.Herrina Robinson. A citizen of the Republic of Sierra Leone I am the wife to Mr. Donald Robinson who worked with former President of Liberian. Mr. Charles Taylor, he was one of the special advisers of former president Charles Taylor, my husband was assassinated on the 29/03/2006 during the arrest of former President Taylor between the Nigerian and Cameroon boarder.I inherited a total sum of ($16, 000, 000, 00.US DOLLARS,SIXTEEN MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLRS) from my late husband, this money which is on Ceiled in a Metallic Trunk Box is deposited with a Security and Finance Company in a West African country called Accra Ghana. This Deposit was coded under a Secret Arrangement as a Family treasure. This means that the Security Company does not know the content of this Trunk box that was deposited in Accra Ghana under a diplomatic coverage for Safe keeping. My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found you and perhaps trust worthy to give you this priority of shipping the Box of Money to any address that you think is very secure and save in your country with your percentage which we shall discuss on soon. In fact, since the Death of my late husband, their family brothers have been seriously chasing me around with my Children.constant Treats because my husband is no more with me again they tried to suppress me so that they might have the documents of his landed properties and confiscate them, They have successfully collected all his properties, yet they never stopped there, they told me to surrender all the belonging account of my late husband, which I did, but I never disclose to them this deposit with the security, company in Accra Ghana. Because this is where my future stand and destiny lies upon.The family of my late husband never aware of the secret existence of this deposit which I made with the security company and they can never be aware of it. Out of fear of my late husbands family, and when the situation becomes uncontrollable because of pressure on me fr
om the Government of the Republic of Liberian, I decide to look for a trust worthy person who could assist me retrieve this box of money from the security company for onward lodgments into his account for the purpose of future investment. Consider my situations a widow and come to my rescue. There is need for urgent action because I'm paying $20 dollars per day as a demurrage to the security company for safe keeping of this consignment. I will send you the Authorization Certificate informations to call them in my next mail which is the Certificate of deposit that they gave on the very day when the box of money was deposited under their company. I give thanks immensely for your co-operation as I look forward to hear from you soon. Contact me through my current private Email:(mrs_herrina100@hotmail.com) I wish you All the best, And God bless.

Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I am Mr. Ibrahim Baaji (SAN) - an attorney of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. I am the personal attorney to Mr. Allen Zook, a national of United States, who worked with Shell Development Company of Nigeria in-charge of crude oil exploration, herein after referred to as my client. 

I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable person/company to handle a confidential transaction on my behalf and my colleagues. 
On the 21st of October 2000, my client, his wife Valerie and their two children (Larry and Daren) died in an auto crash on one of Nigerian roads. Since then I have made several enquiries to the Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives without success. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to look for somebody abroad who is reliable and trustworthy I will forward as next of kin to receive his fund, hence I contacted you. I am contacting you to assist in claiming the money left behind by my client before the bank confiscates or declare the fund unserviceable. 

Until his death, my client had, and maintained a US Dollar currency deposit account with a closing balance of US$19.5M (Nineteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with a Trust Bank in North America, and have written us to recover all such dormant and unclaimed accounts to reinvest it with other funds through the capital market, but we have cleverly written and asked them to release the fund based on the instruction of the next of kin. It is for the urgency of this claim that I write to you to stand and receive the money as Mr. Allen's next of kin since I have failed in attempts in locating the relatives for over 2 years now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since I have perfectly procure all the vital documents that would aid the release of the money and forward it either to Europe or America whereby you will receive the money. 
I am prepared to disburse the money among ourselves in the following ratio: Beneficiary/next of kin 30%, 5% for Bank and legal expenses, while my colleague and myself in the chambers shall have 65%. 

If this proposal is acceptable to you and you do not intend to take undue advantage of the trust we shall bestow on you, then kindly respond immediately, furnishing me with your confidential telephone and fax numbers. I have all necessary legal documents for the release of the fund. On indicating your willingness, I shall contact you for us to work out the modalities for you to receive the funds. All I require is your honesty and co-operation. I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the law. 

Yours faithfully,

 Je vous avoue que cela me ferait plaisir de lier plus
qu'une amitié avec vous et du fond du coeur je souhaiterais
sincèrement vous rencontrer et vous connaitre davantage.
Mais avant, je tiens à me présenter à vous.
 
Je me nommes FEDDAG Safia ,je suis de  nationalité
Algérienne et je vis en Irak . je suis dans ce pays depuis
plus de 13 ans et j'était au service de monsieur Nizar
Hamboum .  J'avais pour rôle de veiller sur le bon
fonctionnement de la résidence à Moussoul 
et à m'occuper de tout ce  qui est comme factures et
charges a régler . 
 
J'étais en quelque sorte le majordome et j'avais
connaissance de plusieurs chosesque mon maître faisait et
 à quoi il était exposé. Monsieur Nizar avait occupé
plusieurs postes
importants dans le pays et  le monde entier. Il fut de 1993
à 1999, ambassadeur des nations unis a New York ;ministre
des affaires étrangères et aussi député dans
son pays. Il a été un membre influant dans la médiation des
relations entre les Etats Unis et l'Irak dans les années
1980 . Il trouva la mort le vendredi 5juillet 2003 à New
York au centre commémoratif  de cancer de Sloan-Kettering
des suite d'une crise cardiaque. Mon
maître m'avait demandé de suivre le dépôt dans une société
de surveillance et de
conservation de biens privés, d'un colis c'est a dire une
mallette qui contenait la somme de 17.500.000 dollars $
(dix sept millions cinq centmilles dollars méricains).Il
m'avait demandé d'effectuer ce dépôt à mon nom et  lui en
faire le rapport car il souhaitait
une discrétion et la sécurité pour son bien . Il m'a
demandé de codifié le colis comme étant  un bien familial
pour les raisons de sécurité de ce fond et pour éviter  des
problèmes avec le gouvernement .Même la société n'est pas
informée du contenu du colis car le colis a été codé comme
un bien familial et donc privé. Avant que la guerre
n'éclate ,
mon maître m'a demandé de prendre immédiatement contact
avec la société afin de faire sortir le colis du pays car
cette somme était destinée  pour des investissements a
l'étranger . Il souhaitait construire un hôtel en Arabie
Saoudite . 
C'est après des renseignements auprès de la société qu'ils
m'ont fait savoir qu'ils pouvaient faire mettre le colis
dans un autre lieu mais cela se fera en Afrique ou se
trouve leur base plus 
précisément en Cote d'ivoire. J'ai remercié DIEU car pour
moi cela était mieux et
ce pays n'est pas très loin de mon pays l'Algérie et
surtout il est en Afrique.  Je viens vers vous pour
solliciter votre aide afin de m'aider à retirer cette
mallette de ce pays et de m'aider à quitter l'Irak pour
votre pays. 
Je voudrais que vous sachez que ce que je fais n'est connu
de personne ni même de sa famille car longtemps   j'ai été
a leur service et sous ce règne barbare qu'offre ce pays et
je n'ai rien eu comme garantie pour la vie et je  suis
fatigué de vivre en esclave toute ma vie .Comme DIEU ne
dort pas il a permit que ce bien soit en ma possession et
que je sois la seul qui  soit informer de son existence .
Je voudrais que vous sachiez que l'aide que vous
m'apporterez ne sera pas vain car j'ai prévu que pour votre
aide  vous recevrez 25% de la somme totale 17.500.000 $).Je
détiens toutes les informations et les documents de
l'existence de ce bien .
 Je voudrais que vous me fassiez savoir si vous souhaitez
me venir en aide afin que je vous communiques les
informations sur ce bien et la société qui a la garde afin
que vous entrez en contact avec eux pour qu'ils  vous
fassent parvenir le colis. Je voudrais que vous sachiez que
c'est une société diplomatique et en leur donnant une
adresse sûr ils vous livrerons le colis . Sachez que le
certificat de dépôt  ne porte pas de nom du bénéficiaire et
qu'il sera facile pour vous de retirer ce colis car il
suffira que vous vous présentez comme le bénéficiaire  de
ce colis. Je voudrais que tout ce que je vous ai dis restes
secret afin degarantir ma sécurité et la sécurité de ce
bien . 
 
Je n'ai aucune source  de communications que l'ordinateur
portable que j'ai dans la chambre donc je m'y contente.
Pour plus de sécurité et de discrétion je souhaiterais  que
vous me comprenez.
Merci de votre comprehension.

Oliveira Savimbi <olisav@netscape.net>,R@M <R@M>,"Tue, 29 Apr 2003 01:42:07 +0200",PRIVATE EMAIL MESSAGE.,"Good day, 

This email message requires your utmost confidentiality. 

It is with warm heart I am offering you my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. I know this is a most unusual way to contact you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, but I am humbly asking that you take due consideration of the importance of my proposal and the immense benefit in it for you. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. 

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my intensive and desperate search for a partner, hence this email to you. I crave your indulgence to read this carefully, in order to have a general overview of my situation. 

My Uncle was killed in a surprise attack by government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried UNITA with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose Dembo and assume leadership in order to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my Uncle who is my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in the war. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came her!
 e 
(Holland) to seek for political asylum. 

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a Private Security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the safety deposit containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland to seek for political asylum here, is the location of the Security Company here in Amsterdam. 

Since President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and he has already done this in Angola, I cannot lodge the funds in my name any where in the world at the moment. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here on arrival last year. 

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that this kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. Please ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. 

Your role in this project, is to act on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, since I can not participate in any business activity or open a bank account here as a political asylum seeker. 

After the safety deposit is claimed, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit and the release codes of the vaults for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you. This transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. 

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.

MRS AMINA MOHAMMED <aminamohammed311@netscape.net>,R@M,"Sat, 16 Aug 2003 18:06:07 -0700",TRUSTED PARTNER.,"Dear Friend, 

Greetings!! 

I come to you with a sincere heart believing in Almighty Allah that you will consider my plight and come to help and also benefit from me. 

I am Mrs. Amina Mohammed, cousin and Personal Assistant to former Nigeria Head of State, Late General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th July 1998 while in power. Before I proceed please accept my apology for the embarrassment this mail might cause you for coming from a total stranger who you do not know. Actually I got your contact from the Internet; please do not feel bad about it because I am compelled to reach you due to urgent need to safeguard the money in question. Once again, forgive me and come to my aid. Please read the following carefully. 

Sometime in early 1997, my boss late Gen. Sanni Abacha entrusted to me the sum of US$20.5M in cash (Twenty million, five hundred thousand US dollars) due to the trust and confidence he had in me. This money was meant for campaign in is self-succession bid but unfortunately he suddenly died before actualization of his aspiration. This amount of $20.5M in CASH was deposited with a security company, which I will disclose in subsequent mail in a giant trunk box as diplomatic consignments In agreement with Mr.Mohammed Abacha who is the son of Late General Abacha and the heir to the money. I write to solicit your Assistance for the money to be transferred to your custody. Note that Mr.Mohammed Abacha is currently in detention by the present Nigeria Government for reasons linked to activities of his father when he was in power. Now based on the business trust I have on you, I would want you to come forward and receive this consignment containing the !
 money in cash on our behalf from the security company for subsequent disbursement between you and us. Understand that we are soliciting your assistance because the present Nigerian Government is seizing/freezing any Bank Account or valuables belonging to the late Head of State's family and relatives. Infact we do not have enough money now to sustain our family so, I will appreciate if you can consider our plight and assist us.For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you with 20% of the total amount ($20.5) while the remaining 80% is for us. We hope to invest part of our share in your country on viable area of investment as you may advise us. 

If you are interested you will need to visit the Security Company for clearance of the consignment. I assure you that the transaction is 100% risk free. Please I implore you to keep this transaction absolutely secret against negative exposure. I would want you to contact me immediately so that we can proceed with the business. You should please on reply enclose your private telephone, fax number so that we can have more confidential correspondence. 

Best regards, 
Mrs. Amina Mohammed.

Accra-Ghana,West-Africa. 
Attn: 
This contact is about financial investment. I came to the conclusion of contacting you with hope that this will transpire into a more mutual relationship between you and Ifor now and in future. 
I am Mr. Nzanga Mobutu, son of the late president Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. As you may have read from the international media, my fathers investments in various places like France, Switzerland and Belgium were all confiscated and his international accounts frozen by their, Governments. 

Now that the situation has calmed down, there is the need for my family to invest discretely in various part of the world without our family name mentioned. It is in view of the above that I make this contact to request if you may like to be my family�s financial manager. 

The fund to be invested is the sum of 58 million U.S.D in the volt of an international bank in Accra Ghana. It is my wish that you invest this fund for us in your country and around the world by engaging into lucrative investments such as buying of shares/stocks in multinational companies, real estate and other non-speculative investment. 
To facilitate an easy transfer of the fund, I have arranged to move the fund to a bank in South Africa from where it will be remitted to your account. 

Upon the acknowledgement of your response, I will arrange for a face-to-face meeting for you and I. In the meeting we shall sign a working agreement and the fund will be handed over to you for investments. 


You may reach me through kanmka@yahoo.co.uk. 
Waiting for your earliest response.

ACCRA GHANA
MONEY INVOLVED(22,000,000 USD)
ALTERNATIVE-MAIL:(mr_gideonkwami@yahoo.co.uk) 

Good Day,
I have a proposal for you-this however is not
mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to
honour against your will. I am Gideon Kwami,24 years
old and the only son of my late parents Mr and Mrs
Kwami.
I got your information in a Proffesional database when
I was searching through internet for a
reliable,honestand trustworthy person to entrust this
business with.I was simply inspired and motivated to
pick your contact from the many names in the list of
the directory after i, go into prayers/fasting.
Well, my father was the rebel leader of the liberian
crisis at ealer last two years before his sudden death
But God knows the truth. My mother died when I was
just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so
special.
Before his death on march 12/2003 he called his
friend who accompanied him to hospital and told him to
call me, on my arrival to the hospital my father told
me that he has the sum of twenty two million Dollars.
(22,000,000 USD) he deposited in his name,in a
security company in Ghana for safekeeping,
And told me where he kept the documents of his secret
funds deposited in Accra - Ghana,the most peaceful
nation in Africa.
And i'm with all the documents which my father used to
deposit the money,and he told me that he disguised the
content to the security as Family Valuable for
security Reason,and he told me that i shold not
disclosed to any body that he have money in the 
security company to avoid trace due to his position in
Liberia.
Please i want you to stand as my fathers partnership
to claim this money out from the security company. I
am just 24 years old and a University undergraduate
and really, I don't know what to do.I,contacted you
because I have suffered a lot of set back as a result
of incessant political crisis here in africa.
The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my
life, I am in a sincere desire of your humble
assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas
will be highly regarded.
It's my pleasure to bring to your notice that after my
late father was murdered the liberian government
siezed all my fathers belonging.
Moreso you should understand that due to the tension
that was impossed on me i am curently in Ghana under
the refugee camp to making sure that my life was safe.
Now permit me to ask these few question.
(1)Can you honestly help me as your son?
(2)Can I, completely trust you?
(3)what percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you after the money is in your
account?
Please, Consider this and get back to me.
With regards.
Gideon Kwami.

My name is Mr. Fredrick Andrew. I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of
Singapore (DBS) of Singapore. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because
a late investor,who bears the same last name with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million
United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all
these years.
Banking regulation legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory
time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory
bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using
my insider leverage, working with you,since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor, we can
secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers
of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I
crave your participation and cooperation.
I have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward
as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated
by you. Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no
risk . Needless to say, Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the
immense benefits of this transaction. I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until
I hear from you. To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email,
stating your full names, date of birth, telephone
number and fax number. I do expect your prompt
response. 
Thank you.

DAVID ELLIS <ellisdav22@portafree.com>,,"Wed, 28 Sep 2005 01:23:19 +0200",CHARITY,"

Hello,
My name is DAVID ELLIS, a nationality of United
Kingdom,I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.
It has defied all forms of medical treatment, and
right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.I have not particularly
lived my life so well, as I never really cared for
anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am
very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile
to people and only focused on my business as that was
the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this
as I now know that there is more to life than just
wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I
believe when God gives me a second chance to come to
this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it.
Now that God has called me, I have willed and given
most of my property and assets to my immediate and
extended family members as well as a few close
friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my
soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth.
So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot
do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the
money which I have there to charity organization in
Bulgaria and Rwanda, they refused and kept the money
to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them.
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I have
with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want
you to help me collect this deposit and despatch it to
charity organizations.
I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.
Please reply to my personal e.mail address ellisd@katamail.com
God be with you.

 Pretoria, South Africa.
 
 Sir,
 
 On behalf of my colleagues and I, I write this letter with great pleasure. Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black
 Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.
 
 Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.
 
 The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
 over-invoiced to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.
 
 The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encourage
 investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the
 co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).
 We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. The changing of beneficiary\\'s information/details and other forms of
 documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.
 I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.
 It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies.
 More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.
 
 This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
 execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.
 Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon your acceptance of this proposal.
 
 Regards,
 
 Dr. Benard Makelele.

ibrahim_ mussa5 <ibrahim_mussa5@hotmail.fr>,,"Fri, 22 Dec 2006 12:46:51 +0100",With Due Respect,"FROM THE DESK OF IBRAHIM MUSSA,
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB)
OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO.WEST AFRICA.

With Due Respect


I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department 
of african development bank (ADB). I crave your indulgence as i contact you 
in such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter 
carefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial 
rewards for both of us.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred 
Thousand US dollars (US$10.5m) only , in an account that belongs to one of 
our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 
in a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been 
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot 
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the 
plan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business 
proposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of 
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank 
treasury as ""unclaimed fund"". The request for a foreigner as next of kin in 
this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner 
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 
30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the 
provision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred 
during the business and 60% would be for me.

There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this 
fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or 
next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account 
number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective 
communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt 
of your reply,

I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not 
fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that 
you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have 
been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you 
receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,
ibrahim mussa,
Bill and exchange manager,
African Development bank ADB

kevin woodgate <kevinwoodgate@walla.com>,,"Mon, 20 Feb 2006 11:07:43 -0500",Regarding Andrew,"Dear sir,

I am Mr. Kevin Woodgate, an attorney at law. A deceased
client of mine, by name Mr. Andrew Parker, who hereinafter
shall be referred to as my client, died as a result of
a heart-related condition in November 2002. I have contacted
you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client
before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank
where this deposit valued at 45 million dollars is lodged.

This bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, or
the account will be confiscated because there is a government
gazzette/mandate/authorising all banks to freeze or consificate
any account that has not been servicable in a long period of time,
this is geared towards capital flight for the economy.

My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as
the next-of-kin and beneficiary of my named client, so that the
proceeds of this account can be paid to you, then we can share
the amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal documents
to back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be provided.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this
transaction through. This will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

If this business proposition offends your moral values, do accept my
apology but if not, then contact me at once to indicate your interest,
by giving me your telephone number, fax number and your address.

I know this message will come to you as a big surprise because we have not met before, but please do not think this is one of those junk emails you received in your email box this is for real. 

I am Rahim Sule I am the personal assistant to the late Mr. Alexander Murphy .my late boss Mr. Murphy spent all his live here in Lagos Nigeria. He is one of the richest contractors based in Nigeria before he died on 10th Jan 2000 together with his only daughter Kimberly in a motor accident. 
the reason I am telling you these is because since Mr. Murphy died, a lot of letters and faxes has been coming to me the personal assistant to inform the next of kin to the late Mr. Murphy for the collection of $15 million united states dollars (fifteen million united states dollars) which is his balance for the road construction contract he executed for the Nigerian government. 

But late Mr. Murphy has no next of kin; he died together with his only child Kimberly who is the next of kin. 
I lived with him for 20 good years and he lost his parents when he was a small boy. Mr. Murphy generation is finished. But nobody knows his history apart from me the personal assistant he told me everything about his life before he died. So this is what I want the both of us to do immediately, I will present you as the next of kin I have all documents and files of the late Mr. Murphy which will cover you up fully as the next of kin. 
The Contract Award Committee is waiting for me to inform the next of kin of late Mr. Murphy for him or her to contact the payment committee for them to release the $15 million United States dollars to the next of kin. 
Anybody I present as the next of kin the money will be given to the person joyfully with my approval. It is only I the personal assistant that can produce the next of kin. This is a quick and sweet business if only you will cooperate with me there is nothing to fear in this business since I am involved. 
The last letter the contract Award committee wrote to me yesterday was that if I cannot inform the next of kin, to contact them for the collection of the $15 million, that the funds will be sent into their government account and it will be used to purchase arms for their soldiers. 
I am just coming back from their office before writing you this letter; I told them that the next of kin will contact them very soon for the collection of fund. 
So I want the both of us to do this business together and collect the $15 million dollars when the fund is collected we must remove 10% of the total amount and give to charity homes then yourself and myself will now share the remaining equally 45% for you 45% for me. 

Please do not tell anybody what I just wrote to you for security reasons and for the safety of the business. 
Please if you will do this business with me send me your telephone number so that I can reach you. 
I wait to hear from you as soon as possible. 
Rahim Sule

Hello my dear,

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is 
not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. I am a Director in 
Procurement Department with Petroleum Ministry here 
in U. A. E.  I obtained your email while searching for a reliable 
person, who could assist me in receiving transfer of a supposed 
contract awarded funds.  This fund came as a result of over estimated 
contract awarded sums executed by foreign contractors in the Petroleum 
Ministry. The concerned Ministry has approved these over invoiced 
funds for payment. The contracts which the
over invoiced sums was created from has been executed and 
commissioned. What I am about to receive now, is the over estimated 
funds which was added during the process of obtaining the contracts 
for my own interest.  This is a normal deal that goes in my Ministry 
by top officials.

On my part, all modalities have been worked out in ensuring a smooth 
conclusion of the contract payment to your bank account within the 
next few days.  My department approves payments to 
contractors, and I happen to head the department.  All I want from you 
is to receive these funds on my behalf as a Sub-Let Company, because 
as Government Official I cannot collect the funds directly from my 
Ministry, neither I am allowed by Law to operate/ run foreign bank 
accounts. If you are trustworthy and can assist me in receiving the 
fund, do not hesitate to respond back to me immediately.

Please note that there is no risk involved in receiving the over 
estimated contract funds in your account.  I want you to state in 
percentage what you shall have for participating in using your 
bank account to secure the funds.  As soon as you indicate your 
interest, further details and the amount involved shall be given to 
you once I receive response from you.  I hope I can trust you 
to treat this proposal with utmost confidentiality.

Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.  

Best regards,

Engineer Waheed Kamal.

Hello,

It may come to you as a surprise hearing from me, but to be precise I
got your data from the your e-mail site member directory in my search
for a competent business manager/hard working person who is willing and able to be my friend and partner, to liaise with me in order to 
execute a project which I am convinced that you are capable and trusted to do this business with me.

I am Mark Luke, 32 years old and good looking man, and I am from River
State of Nigeria. I have B.SC in Public Administration and I work with
GLOBAL SECURITY & FINANCE LTD. I have now developed the interest in having a business investment outside Nigeria without my employers
knowing about it. Hence I contacted you for friendship and business
relationship.

The fund in question proposed for this project is US$14.8million
(Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars Only), which I will
like you to receive on my behalf and to invest it in your business or in
any business that you think will be profitable in your country.

Please Note: This fund came as a result of a multi-national company that
we helped to secure an oil drilling contract some years ago. Because of
our interest, the contract was over-invoiced to the above mentioned
amount and after the contract, the company received their actual
contract sum and went back to their country leaving behind this
over-inflated sum for me and my colleagues to claim.

Now the time has come for me to process and move the fund out for
investment, but I can not do it on my own since I am still working with
the Global Security & Finanace Ltd. This is why I need your help so that
I can use you or your company to process the release of the fund as if 
you are reciving a payment of an executed contract.

Please let me know about yourself/company and also let me know if you
can be able to receive the money on my behalf and invest it in your
company or any good and profitable business in your country without
exposing me, so that we can commence with the process of transfer. 
All you need to send immediately is your FULL NAMES or COMPANY NAME and your TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBERS

Your share will be 40% for your assistance, while I will take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses that will be incurred in the cause of
transfer.

Please write back if only you know you are capable enough to execute
this project with me. Please this transaction requires utmost
confidentiality. My alternative Private email address is:
            markluke@bareed.com

Looking forward to your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
Mark Luke

Mr Patrick Chan <chanpatrick5@yahoo.com.hk>,,"Tue, 03 Apr 2007 03:45:49 -0400",CONTACT ME ASAP,"

Good Day
I am Mr. Patrick Chan, Executive Director and Chief Financial
Officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a concealed business
suggestion for you.

Our client Gen. Samir Abi Rahman who was with the Iraqi forces
and also businessman made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months,
with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United
State Dollars only in my branch. Several maturities notices was
sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after
the war another notification was sent and still no response came
from him. We later found out that the General along with his wife
and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast
that hit their home.


After more inquiry it was also discovered that Gen. Samir Abi
Rahman did not declare any next of kin in his official papers
including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided
in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew
of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no
one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is
that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 5
years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this
backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Samir Abi Rahman
so that you will be able to receive his funds.

MODALITIES:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so
that we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will
prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next
of kin to Gen. Samir Abi Rahman. After you have been made the next
of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and
secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour
for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are going
adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the
necessary
documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your
nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 60% for
me 40% for you.

Should you be interested send me the following:
1, Full names,
2, private phone number,
3, current residential address,

And I prefer you reach me on my private email address below:
(patrickchan202@yahoo.com.hk) and finally after I shall provide you
with more
details on this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Mr. Patrick Chan.

You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site    The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and  a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you.  You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Three years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than three years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner.

Dearest Beloved


Base on your profile i am happy to request for your assistance and also

to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you. I am  MISS maria denise,20years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS denise My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. 


It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2003.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special.



Before his death on Febuary 12 2003 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was decleared as family valuables personal for security reasons. 


I am just 20years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.


 Now permit me to ask you these question:-


(1.) Can I completely trust you?



Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.


Thank you so much.


My sincere regards,


MISS maria denise.

 Dear Friend,
I am contacting you in regards to a business transfer of a hugh sum of 
money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this 
magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring 
you that all will be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact 
you due to the urgency of this transaction.
PROPOSITION;
We discovered an abandoned sum of $14,300,000.00 (Fourteen Million 
Three Hundred Thousand Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of 
our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his 
death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay 
claims to this money as the heir.
We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies  for 
claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking 
guidelines. Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have 
you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will 
be carefully worked out by us for the funds ($14,300,000.00) to be 
released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin.
It may interest you to note that we have secured from the probate an 
order of madamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries.Please 
acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual 
business endeavour by furnishing me with the following;
1. Beneficiary name and address.
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers.
These requirements will enable us file a letter of claim to the 
appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before 
the transfer can be made. We shall be compensating you with 25% on 
final conclusion of this 
project, while the rest shall be for us. Your share stays with you 
while the rest shall be for us for investment purposes.
If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of 
the trust we have bestowed in you.
I await your urgent mail.
Regards,
Mr.Frank Jim.

URGENT BUSINESS TRANSFER

I know that this will come to you as a surprise since we don't know each
other before. For the purpose of introduction, I am MR JOB TUTU the chief
auditor of amalgamated bank of South Africa (ABSA). When I was going
through some old files in the record I discovered that there is an account
opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this
account again.
The owner of this account is Mr. Smith B Andra's, a foreigner/contractor
and a miner at Kruger gold mining Pty., a geologist by profession who died
since 1991. no other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it and the account has no beneficiary and investigation on this
account proves to me that his company is not aware of this account and the
amount involved is US$18.3M ( Eighteen Million Three Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars Only).
I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be
approved to a local bank account here, but can only be approved to any
foreign account because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of
the account Mr. Smith B. Andra's is a foreigner too. So if you find this
proposal interested kindly indicate your interest by contacting me and
also send to me your private telephone and fax numbers for easy and
confidential communication. 
Please be inform that this transaction is risk free for all arrangements
on how to transfer this money to your account has be made ready because I
will use my positions to get all internal documentations to back up the
claims, only waiting for your approval of agreement to assist me. And for
your personal assistance, you will be given 25% of the total sum while 5%
will be for expenses made by both parties during the transfer and 70% will
be use to establish a lucrative business/ investment for me in your
country through your assistance because I cannot bring one dollar back to
my country.
Moreover, I need your trust and confidentiality promising you will not
take advantage of the situation that makes you the beneficiary to this
account and hoping that you can be able to handle such amount of money in
strict confident till I come over to your country for appropriate
disbursement and investment.
I wait for your urgent response by Email, Call or Fax. Thanks And God Bless

Yours Truly,

Mr. Job Tutu

NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION [NNPC]
Victoria-Island,Lagos.
FROM THE OFFICE OF:DR. JEFF MBOMA (MNIM)

Attn: President/CEO.
BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$25.6 M (TWENTY-FIVE
MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) &
BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this
transaction,this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly
confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us in
confidence through the Nigerian Chamber of
Commerce, Foreign Trade Division.
I am Dr.Jeff Mboma, the Secretary of the Federal Government
of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee (CAMC) of
the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation [NNPC].Sometime ago, a contract was
awarded to a conglomerate of Foreign Companies
by my committee on behalf of NNPC, the contract was
over-invoiced to the tune of US $25.6 Million.This was done
deliberately, the over-invoicing was a deal by members of my
committee to benefit from the project, we now desire to
transfer the money, which is presently in a suspense account
of NNPC in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) into an
overseas account which we expect you to provide
We have agreed that the following funds will be shared thus
after it has been paid into your account;
a) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the
beneficiary of the fund.
b) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for
reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that
may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
c) 60% to us the government officials (which we wish to
commence an important business in conjunction with you).
I Would Require
a) Name and address of Company/ Beneficiary
b) Proforma Invoice / Letter-Head Paper

The above information would be used to make formal
applications as a matterof procedure for the release of the
money and onward transfer to your nominated account.
It does not matter whether or not your company or you does
contract projects of the nature described here, the
assumption is that you won a major contract and
subcontracted it out to other companies, more often than
not,big trading companies or individuals of unrelated field
win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized
firms for execution of such contracts.
We have strong and reliable connections and contacts at the
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and The Federal Ministry of
Finance and we have no doubts at all that this money will be
released and transferred if we get the necessary
foreign partners to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when
the business is successfully concluded we shall through the
same connections withdraw all documents used from all the
concerned government ministries for 100% security.
We want this money to be transferred to the foreign account
which you are going to provide bearing in mind that our
civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign
company or running foreign account, all
expenses regarding the account opening if not already in
existence shall be borne by you, all expenses are however
reimbursable as already stated above on conclusion of
business.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter if you are
interested.
I wait in anticipation of your co-operation.

Yours Faithfully,

Dr.Jeff Mboma (MNIM)

The option left for the Bank management is to declare the deceased account dormant and revert the funds to trading on behalf of and in the interest of the Bank.In order to avoid this development,my Colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a distant relative to Mr.and Mrs.Wolfgang Schinister,so that the funds would be released to you.All documents and proofs to enable you get the funds will be carefully worked out by an attorney which we shall secretly appoint for you.

FROM:MR. CHEUNG PUI

Hang Seng Bank Ltd

Sai Wan Ho Branch

171 Shaukiwan Road

Hong Kong.





Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of 

operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.

I have an obscured business suggestion for you.



Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war two years ago. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.



After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration four years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.



Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.



WHAT IS TO BE DONE:



I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.



There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.



Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you . Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below

(cpui_hsbm01@mail2europe.com) and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.



Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.



Regards



Mr.Cheung Pui

TEL:+(221)4488469 EMAIL: rev.davclk@katamail.com  Dear Friend.  I am Rev. Fr. David Clark, a senior staff with the UN special duties office,my office monitors and controls the affairs of all banks and financial institutions.   I have before me list of funds, which could not be transferred to some nominated accounts as these accounts have been identified either as ghost accounts, unclaimed deposits and over-invoiced sum etc; I have the opportunity to write you based on the instructions among others i received days ago from the officer in the computer section in person of Engineer Peter Cliff,to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number(LM-05-371) amounting US$10 million.The (Ten Million Dollars) is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get the box shipped to you.  As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. The problems you are having is that of interest groups. A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday. Also we found out that some of the officials of the parastatals have been extorting a lot of money from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers. For security reasons you do not have to tell anybody that your have your payment on the way until the payment gets to you.    The said payment is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get this box shipped to you,the(CSO)and i Yesterday went to this four courier companies Dhl, Ems, FedEx and Ups to make arrangements on how to get the box shipped to you by courier, but to no avail the above courier companies all made us to understand that they will have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment. This is something we want to avoid because this box is been padded with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine.  We told the courier services that the box contained film materials and when open will spoil the materials.  we did not declare money because courier does not carry money.    Today a friend of mine who is a diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialized in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another, which also has diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world. I have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them, which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat who will be bringing in this consignment to you is an expert and has been in this line of work for many years now so we have Notting to worry about. After all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500,000.00) to any charity organisation I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect, you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by the courier. Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not to inform anyone about this until you received your money. Am helping you on this because something in me is tells me that you are an honest person. When you conclude this and you send fufill the agreement, we will help to ship the final part of your money to you.  May God be with you as i await your response. Feel free to call me if you will like us to discuses more. Yours Faithfully, Revd. Fr. David Clark. Director, Special Duties.UN/WBF. TEL:+(221)4488469",0,1

I am Mr. John Coleman and my sister is Miss Rose Coleman, we are thehildren of late Chief Paul Coleman from Sierra Leone. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of twenty one Million Dollars ($21,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company does not know the content as money, although my father made them to under stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner.

Source of the money:

My late father Chief Paul Coleman , a native of Mende District in the Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales.

Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to HOLLAND NETHERLAND, with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aid

of U.N evacuation team.

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation,we are nowlike refugees and orphans.

Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firm To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways.

2. to transfer this money (USD$21M) in your name to your country
3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our

2000, Since then I have made several inquiries to your

has proved abortive.

After all these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to
get in touch with the consul-General to locate any member of
his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to
assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by
my client before they get confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were
lodged, particularly the CITIZENS INT'L BANK PLC Where the
deceased had an account Valued at about ($15 Million United

within the next ten official working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for
over 5 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the
next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last
name so that the proceeds of this account valued at ($15
Million US Dollars) can be paid to you and then you and me

expenses will be shared equal and this will be after tax is
deducted by the (IRS) in your country. An attorney will be
contracted to help us revalidate and notarize all the
necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any
claim we may make.

this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you and me
from any breach of the law.

FROM DIDI SITHOLE,
JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
TELL:+27-732112866.

Dear sir,

I am MR, DIDI SITHOLE, the son of late
MR.PATRICK SITHOLE, who was murdered in a land dispute
in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for
reliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My
late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the
ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South
Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars
($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he
knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was
deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much
dumourage from the security firm.
This money was earmarked for the purchase of new
machinery and chemicals for the farms and the
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.
This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE
introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the
White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently
condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the
government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob
actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South
Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided
to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the
Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher
transfer of the money to a foreign country where we
can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of
claiming/investing this amount of money in South
Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in
future since both countries have the same political
history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does
not allow such investment hence I am seeking for
an asylum or refugee.
I must let you know that this business is 100% risk
free and the nature of your business does not
necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us
claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have
agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be
for a joint business venture I will be doing with you
and another 35% will be for me and my family which we
shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%
will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure
during the transaction.
Therefor, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance. Please funish me your private phone and Fax
number
for easy and better communication.
Remember that this is highly confidential and the
success of this business depends on how secret it is kept.

Expecting your reply soonest.
Best Regard.

Mrs.Angelina Ebony Dazza <angel_ebony@codehot.co.uk>,,"Mon, 23 May 2005 17:40:31 -0800",God Bless You My Dear Contact Me!!!,"Hello My Dear,
Please forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a
surprise I got your contact from a database found in internet while 
searching for a reliable and honest person that will assist us receive a fund  
intoan account.I was divinely inspired to pick your name among other  names
found in the Internet database. After series of prayers and fasting  
for Gods direction.
I am Mrs.Angelina Ebony Dazza a citizen of Columbia undergoing  
currently medical treatment. I am married to Dr. Dazza Lamin who  worked 
with the Malaysia Embassy in South Africa for nine years before he died in 
the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a  child.He died 
after
a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before  his death we 
were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry 
or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $15 Million  
(Fifteen million  U.S.Dollars) with a finance/security company in  ASIA.The money
is inside one trunk boxes, but nobody knew that the boxes  contained money
apart from me and my late husband, the boxes was deposited as Photographic
Materials. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not live for the next three months
due to my cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my disability
to move around which is a partial paralysis. Having known my condition 
I decided to donate this fund to a church or a mosque or better still a 
Christian or a Moslem individual that will utilize this money the way I am going 
to instruct herein. I want a church or Mosque or the individual 
beneficiary that will inherit this to use it for churches or Mosque orphanages and 
widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is 
beautified.They said blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because
I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's 
relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to 
be mis-used by unbelievers. I do not want a situation where this money 
will be used in an ungodly manner,hence the reason for taking this bold 
decision.I am not afraid of death because I know where I am going. I know that I
am going to be in the bossom of my Saviour.
If you feel you are worthy enough to make yourself available  in this 
project, let me know immediately you read my mail. GOD will surely provide  for 
you the power and strenght to accomplish this. All things work together for
good for those who love GOD. Waiting for your urgent response. I do not
need any telephone conversation in this regard because of my health,and
because of the presence of my husband?s relatives who are always around
me. I do not want them to know about this development.
Thank you and God bless.
Yours sincerely,
Mrs.Angelina Ebony Lamin.

taylor robert <roberttt9@hotmail.com>,,"Fri, 03 Mar 2006 11:00:33 +0000",FROM ROBERT CAN YOU HELP ME OUT? IS VERY URGENT,"Dear Sir,
With a very desperate need for assistance, I have summed up courage
to contact you. I am from (will disclose this later), presently
working in Iraq with an international organisation that I will also
disclose later, I found your contact particulars in an
address journal.
I am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of (US$8.523
Million Dollars) Eight Million five Hundred Thousand And Twenty
Three Dollars to
your country or any other safe country of your choice, as far as I can be
assured that my share will be safe in your care untill I complete
my service here,this is no stolen money, and there are no dangers involved.
SOURCE OF MONEY:
Some money in various currencies was discovered concealed in
barrels with piles of weapons and ammunitions at a location near one
of Saddam,s old palaces during a rescue operation, and it was
agreed by all party present that the money be shared amongst us, this
was quite an illegal thing to do, but I tell you what? no
compensation can make up for the risks we have taken with our lives
in this hell hole.
The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this
kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a German
contact working here, and his office enjoys some immunity, I was able
to get the package out to a safe cation entirely out of trouble
spot. He does not know the real contents of the package, and
believes that it
belongs to an Asian/American who died in an air raid, and before giving
up, trusted me to hand over the package to his business associate. I
have now found a secured way of getting the package out to a safer
country for you to pick up, and will discuss this with you when I am
sure that you are willing to assist me.
One passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this
matter with a third party, should you have reasons to reject
this offer, please destroy this mail as any leakage of this
information will be too bad for us.
I do not know for how long we will remain here, and I have
survived 2 suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and
other reasons I will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help, I
honestly want this matter to be resolved immediately. Please contact
me as soon as possible.
Regards,
Robert Taylor

My name is Mr Michael eze the Manager, Credit and Foreign bills of trust 
bank of africa limited.
I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account
number 14-255-2004/utb/t whose name is Joung Heasook, Korea who perished in 
a plane crash[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on 
August 6,1997.And for your perusal you can view thisweb site

http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with
keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one 
has come to claim his funds of US$25.5M (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred 
Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with my branch for a very 
long time.
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the
Next of Kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking 
ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because 
money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.
In view of this i will give you 30% of the total. Upon the receipt of
your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax 
number and the next step to take.I will not fail to bring to your
notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain 
any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five 
banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.
When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying your
decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.

Yours Sincerely,

Abu Kyari. <akyari1@sudanmail.net.sd>,akyari1@sudanmail.net.sd,"Thu, 31 Jul 2003 09:38:14 +0300",Re: Please confirm receipt.,"Greetings and Compliments.

I have gotten your contact from the internet, listed as a 
professional 
whom I might be able to transact with, and this makes me 
feel I may 
make a sincere proposition to you, and I have decided to 
make this preposition to you in good faith, which relates 
to a realistic and genuinely simplistic business opening 
that needs the participation of a person with your 
expertise, and ingenuity and a clear indication to
trustworthiness and sincerity.

I am a lawyer residing and practicing in Nigeria as you 
may need to know and I represent the interest of a client 
who is a Brother as well who has made an offer to me which 
is most lucrative, my correspondence with you from hence 
is dictated by the need for us to get the participation of 
a neutral foreigner who will assist us perfect the 
transaction.

My client was a prominent figure in the Military Politics 
and rule of 
my country for about ten years and he has had complicity 
in a few economic scandals and a host of litigations too 
he has had a lot of his physical and monetary assets 
seized by the Nigerian Government who consider him as a 
part of the corrupt machinery of the then Military 
Government. Now he has a substantial amount deposited in a 
bank in Nigeria (US$ 25.M.) and he is very scared that 
this account will be discovered because similar accounts 
in Switzerland and England were previously discovered and 
frozen by the governments of those countries in 
collaboration with the Government of Nigeria.

Precisely, my client's family returned US$ 1B. to the 
government of Nigeria in 2002 under the direction of the 
Swiss banking authorities, this is a confirmable matter, 
even as the existence of the fund mentioned above is 
confirmable. 

Now it is his intention to migrate with his family out of 
Nigeria 
towards the Middle East and he depends so much on this 
fund, thus he is
looking for a reliable and trustworthy person who will 
receive the money
discreetly and then transfer the money at a latter date to 
a neutral account to be established in Lebanon when he 
finally succeeds with his emigration plan.

If you accept my proposition and agree to participate in 
this 
transaction, you will in no case whatsoever undertake 
risk- expend 
money or execute any unreasonable task- whereas you will 
be well remunerated, in principle you will receive 10% of 
the amount transferred to you once the transaction is 
completed.

Apart from this there is another sum of Money, held up in 
a Security 
Company (In Cash), the Money was earmarked for the support 
of the cause of Charity in India, but it was never 
retrieved before the demise 
of my clients father, now my client also wants to retrieve 
this money in addition to the money with the bank in 
Nigeria. The money with the Security Company is Thirty one 
Million American Dollars in one hundred dollar bills.

Since I do not know in what vein you will take this 
missive I have kept 
the information peripheral, I will be posited to give 
further information upon your acceptance and will also 
introduce you to my client eventually.  I hope I will be 
able to work with you earnestly unto our joint success.

I await your response eagerly.

Respectfully.

Dear.md

       It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet. 

My name is Mrs chrrey Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.


My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.

Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.

It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.

This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE
 and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.

And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.

Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.

So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  

I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.

Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project. 

Best regards,

Mrs Chrrey mohameed

Dear,


I am Mr Malick Diop, the director of Contract Awards
and Finance Allocations of the Federal Ministry of Works
and Housing. I presided over the award of the building of
the federal government satellite housing estates at here
in Dakar, the new federal capital city of Senegal.

During the bid for the contract, I had a pact with the
eventual winner of the bid and the contractor of the
project to inflate the contract sum to the tune of US$30
Million Dollars. The contract has since been executed, and
job completion certificate duly awarded. Furthermore, the
payment for the contract has been fully made to the
contractor leaving behind the over-inflated amount of US$30
Million Dollars, which I have secured under contract ref.
No: FMWH/FRN/108X01/2002.

The problem now is that as a senior civil servant, I am
prohibited by the civil service code from running a private
business or foreign bank account. Moreover, I am required
to declare my assets annually with the civil service
commission for verification and clearance, and therefore,
cannot defend this large amount of money as an addition to
my assets without compromising my reputation and the
impeccable records I have achieved over the years.

Therefore, I need your cooperation to be present as a sub-contractor
in the execution of the
project/contract to claim the fund on my behalf.

For volunteering your cooperation in this deal, you are
entitled to 40% of the fund. Should this be acceptable to
you, kindly indicate in writing and confirm the following:

 Telephone and fax numbers for prompt communication.

 Bank name, address and account number where the fund will
 be moved.

Full name of company and address or personal name and
address that will serve as the beneficiary/sub-contractor
to claim the fund.

Furthermore, as soon as this fund is transferred into your
bank account, I will require you to still act as my agent
in investing my share in estates/landed properties and
financial securities in your country.

I want to emphasize here that this deal is free from any
form of risk from both parties as great care has been
exercise in perfecting it, and therefore, I enjoin you to
approach it with an open mind and without any fear
whatsoever. As a deal, I make haste to advise that you
should be private about it.

Kindly channel all correspondences through:
marlick_diop@myway.com

Mr.Malick Diop.

MR COLINS BROWN <colins_brown@yehey.com>,linguistics@UM,"Fri, 30 Apr 2004 03:02:22 -0700",URGENT BUSINESS PLAN,"Dear Friend,

Greetings and complement of the season.
My name is Mr. Colins Brown. I am the eastern manager of
united bank of africa Plc (UBA),Abuja branch Nigeria.This
letter might surprise you because we have not met neither
in person nor by correspondence,but please you should
exercise some patience and read through my message. I have
a very urgent and confidential business proposal for you.

I want to transfer out $USD 26 million ( TWENTY SIX MILLION
U.S DOLLARS) from our bank. I have the courage to look for
a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this
important Business,believing that you will never let me
down either now or in future.

HOW THE MONEY CAME ABOUT:
There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since
1990 nobody has operated on this account again,after going
through some old files in the records I discovered that if
I do not remitte this money out urgently it will be
forfeited for nothing.The owner of this account is Mr. Jack
Hamilton, he is a foreigner and the manager of of petrol
chemical service,a chemical Engineer by proffession and he
died  since 1990, and since then no other person knows
about this account or anything concerning it.secondly he
did not clearify his next of kin in his deposition form
when he deposited this fund in our bank.The account has no
other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that his company does not know anything about this account
and the amount involved is (U.S.$ 26,000,000.00).

I want to tranfer this money into a safe foreign account
abroad but i don't know any foreigner,I am contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
any local bank here but can only be approved to a foreign
account because the money is in u.s dollars and the former
owner of the account (MR.JACK HAMILTON) is a foreigner too.
I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as
we don't know ourself before,but be sure that it is real
and a genuine business.I believe in god that you will never
let me down in this business,you are the only person that i
have contacted
for this business for now,so please reply urgently so that
we can receive this money into a foreign account or any
account of your choice
where the fund will be remmited.

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a
foreigner with a
foreign account as the real beneficiary,I need your
co-operation to makethis work fine,because the management
of our bank is ready to approve this payment to any
foreigner who has the correct information to this account
which i will give to you when sure of your capability to
handle such amount with instrict confidence and trust,and
according to my instructions and my advice for our mutual
benefit because I don't want to make any mistake. I need
your strong assurance and trust, I shall also destroy all
documents concerning this transactions immidiately we
received this money leaving no trace to any place. I will
use my position and influence on other staffs to effect
legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your
account
with appropriate clearance from foreign payment
department,with assurance that this money will be intact
pending my physical arrival in your country for the sharing
and other investment.

Finally,at the conclusion of this business,you will be
given 25% of the
total ammount,70% will be for me ,while 5% will be for
expenses both
parties might have incured during the process of this
transaction. I look forward to your earliest reply through
my  e-mail address:
brown_colins@uymail.com}.

Thanks and God bless you.


Yours truly,
Mr. Colins Brown

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.
REPLY TO EMAIL ADDRESS: awilliams44@k.ro
Dear Friend,
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is 
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your 
indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR Ademola Williams 
of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, 
may his soul rest in peace.
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my 
country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the 
rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one 
of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in 
Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being 
threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi 
Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other 
Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.In 
view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist 
us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a 
security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the 
Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through 
normal custom/airport screening and clearance.friends (western countries) who 
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President 
Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor 
met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in 
your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, 
this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge 
success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires 
a total confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund 
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your 
telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost 
indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your 
Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.

Best Regards

MR WILLIAMS .

REQUEST FOR
URGENT

ASSISTANCE/INVESTMENT.

Dear Sir/Madam ,

My names is MR. JIDE WILLIAMS, 
the elder son of Mr. ANTHONY WILLIAMS, of Zimbabwe. It might be a
surprise to you where I got your contact address, I got it from network on line, South African. During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe
by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms 
to his party members and their followers.

My father was one of the best
farmers in the country and knowing that he did not support the presidential
political ideology, the presidential supporters invaded

my fathers farm
burnt down everything, shot him and as a result of the wounds

sustained, he
became sick and died after two days. And after his death, I with

my
younger Brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our 

lives 
to South-Africa.

BUT, before he died HE WROTE HIS WILL, which reads

""(MY
BELOVEED SON ,I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO

reliable foreign partner to assist you
to transfer this money out of South Africa for

investment purpose. I deposited the money in your name and it can be

claimed by you alone with the deposit code. your mother has all the documents. Take good care of your mother and brother."" From the above, you will understand that the lives and
future of my family depends on this money as much, I will be very grateful if you can assist us. I with my younger brother are now

living in South-Africa as POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS and the financial law of SOUTH-AFRICA does not allow ASYLUM SEEKERS certain Financial rights to such huge amount of money .In view of this, I cannot invest this money in South-Africa, hence I am asking you to assist me transfer this money out of South-Africa for investment purposes. For your efforts, I am prepared to offer you 20% of the total

fund, while 5% will be set aside for local and international expenses and 75% will be kept for me and my family

conveyed to you 

once we establish trust and confidence between ourselves.

Dear Sir,
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on
behalf of my colleagues. Your information was given to
me by a member of the South African Export Promotion
Council (SAEPC) who was with the Government delegation
on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference
talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to
seek a confidential co-operation with you in the
execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all
parties and hope you will keep it confidential because
of the nature of this business.

Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I
work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation
and with the co-operation of three other top
officials, we have in our possession an overdue
payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain
percentage of the total contract value executed on
behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm,
which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of
US$28.500,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present Government is determined to pay
foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain
good relationship with foreign governments and
non-governmental agencies. We intend to include our
bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and
the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB). So we are
seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the
> unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate
foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary
information upon application for claim to reflect
payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of
you/your company.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be so
negotiated and agreed upon by both you and we on this
side, before further details will change hands to
enhance our primary objective.

The business is completely safe and secure, provided
you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not
matter whether you/your company does contract projects
as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of
you/your company to settle any legality. Also, your
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the
successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint us.

For further details, do not hesitate to contact me 
on my confidential email address, or
 contact of one of  my  parthner who is now 

in spain undergoing studies  his name is  frank mthemba,
and his number is 0034-609-133-527



Awating your urgent response.

It may interest you to know that the former president of (Haiti) has been fighting serious  war for United  Democracy  for quite some years now, which has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.

Not quite long ago, the American government ordered  (President, Jean Bertrand Aristed) to leave  (Haiti) or be forced out of power by a Rabel force.Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations, (President Aristed) decided,and left the seat of power  into exile in South Africa country to seek asylum. now a new government is in place .
 
In the light of all these sad happenings, there was this deposit he made with a Security Company in Europe in year May 2001 ,this took place while he was still in power as the president of Haiti, through my aid, his Personal Assistant, (Ron Sinclear) and some loyalist, he suceeded to secretely move the sum of ($9.5M USD) (NINE MILLION,FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND, UNITED STATES DOLLARS] to a private security company vault in Europe. Now, we need your services as  a highly reliable foreigner to receive the funds into your bank account for the future survival of my family because he (Aristed)  cannot presently operate any foreign bank account in his name. These funds (US$9.5m USD.) arose from various money i received from the sales of diamonds deals, i had with ( President Charles Taylor) of Liberia, which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of  liberia.  

I have decided that if you are able assist us,you shall be compensated with 25% commission of the funds, 5% of this money shall be set aside to take care of any local or foreign expenses that might be incurred along the line. My family will have the remaining 75% of the funds.

DEAR Friend,

Please reply to ""nzangamobutu@ecplaza.net""

I know that this letter will come to you as a surprise
considering the fact that we have not met before.May
the Almighty God bless you as you read this email.I am
trully looking for someone that will assist me with a
business that has to do with my family estate which my
late father left behind for us.i am contacting you
based on the fact that i want someone that is not
known to my family to assist me in this business and
this is for security reasons which i will explain to
you as we make progress.

I am the first son of the late Joseph Desire Mobutu,
the former President of ""ZAIRE"" now democratic
republic of congo .I am presently on political asylum in Nigeria . I
got your contact over the internet during my search
for a person that will assist me in this business.this
became neccessary as i do not want anybody known to me
or my family to be associated with this money.
I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us and that it is 100% risk free. However, you
must confirm your ability to handle this because it involves a large amount of
money. The funds ""THIRTY SEVEN MILLION UNITED STATES
DOLLARS"" ($37million)is my share of my father's
estate. 

I boxed and shipped the money to a security
company abroad at the peak of the a political uprising
that rocked my country few years ago. Now that the
crisis has ended , I need a trustworthy person to
proceed to the place of the security company in order to clear the fund and
afterwards,i will come to your country for us to start
a joint business venture as i do not have the
intention of bringing the funds back to Africa for a
very long time.Note that I will send to you the
relevant documents that will enable you take
possession of the fund for onward investment for our
mutual benefit. All I need from you is as follows:


1. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this
business for me.

2.your word that you will keep this business as 
confidential as possible at all times until we
conclude this business.

3. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.

4. Your full permanent address.

As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose to you the name and the country of the
security company, the contact of the diplomat that i
have hired to assist us in this business,as well as 
your name and particulars to the security company as my
representative and my partner to enable them contact
you accordingly. As we make progress,i will send to
you a""LETTER OF AUTHORITY"" and ""AGREEMENT LETTER"" to
enable you clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this
is a very safe transaction as this funds is my share
of my father's estate.Please reply to ""nzangamobutu@ecplaza.net""

I await your response to enable us proceed.

ibrahim bello <ibrahim_bell13@hotmail.com>,,"Sat, 21 Jan 2006 09:44:15 +0000",REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP  !!!,"FROM:DR IBRAHIM BELLO
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO
WEST AFRICA.
PHONE:00226-76-441-987

Attention Please,
                                                      (TOP  --  SECRET)
I am Dr Ibrahim  Bello , the director in charge of auditing and accounting 
section
Bank Of Africa(B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa.

With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business 
transaction that will be very beneficial for both of us at the end of it.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 
October 31st 2002 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his 
account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either 
from his family or relatives before our discovery to this development.

The said amount was U.S $22.2M (twenty two million two hundred thousand 
United States dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through 
the Burkina-faso chamber of foreign relations here in Ouagadougou 
Burkina-faso.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the 
bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer 
this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and 
needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your 
interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this 
great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(As a Banker),we are not allowed to operate a 
foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the 
time of transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who 
will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to 
the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to 
be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification 
and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole 
money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone 
bills, while 60% will be for me . Please, you have been adviced to keep 
""TOP-SECRET"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service 
after we conclude this deal .

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and  further  investment, either in your country or any country you advice 
me  to invest in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.if 
you are really sure of your integrity reply me immediately or you call me on 
my mobile phone .

Yours faithfully,

Dr Ibrahim Bello.

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.




Dear friend ,

I am the manager of bill and exchange at FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.BANK OF 
AFRICA(BOA)I am writing, following the impressive information about you 
through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm in your country. He 
assured me of your capability and releability to champion this
business opportunity.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten 
Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his entire family on Monday,31 July, 2000,in a 
plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been 
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot 
release it unless
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that 
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this
discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make 
this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of 
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the
bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here 
stipulates that if such money
remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the 
bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in 
this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner 
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my 
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for 
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location
wherein the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for 
more explanations.

Yours faithfully,

Compliments of the day to you!

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha widow of the late General Sanni Abacha
former Nigerian Military President who died on active Government
service on june 8, 1998.

I got your contact from the Internet and I do believe you can
help me.

I am contacting you due to the present situation as regards the
undemocratic manner the present administration in my country
(Nigeria) is taking all that belongs to us You may be aware
that this is the usual attitude of leaders especially in Africa
when there is a change of Government. The present Government of
General Olusegun Obasanjo is currently in a face off with my
family in his bid to recover all our money because my Husband is
dead.

They have brought up charges of corrupt enrichmemnt against us.
Unfortunately, he is currently facing same from the National
Assembly right now. I pray he does not get an Impeachment The
law they made is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to
frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred for
my family. A personal vendetta by President Obasanjo who was
jailed by my husband's Government for plotting a coup d 'etat
against his administration in 1995.


This highly calculated attempt by this administration plus some
Western Banks through bi-lateral relationship has taken away from
us a whopping amount in Switzerland and Bank accounts around the
World. This rampaging of our Bank accounts abroad have yielded to
the barbaric pressure and just few months ago we were squized
out of another US$395m because the accounts bear our names. This
assertions can be ascertained independently if you wish to
confirm this from a leading newspaper in Nigeria (This Day Newspapers) from
their website at www.thisdayonline.com from the archives section in the
March 10,2001, January 26,2002 and March 18, 2002 editions.

This pressure is taking a great toll on my family and all we ever
owe. You may be aware that my surviving eldest son (Mohammed),
was undully detained without trial untill thursday 11TH of July
2002 one year now that the Supreme Court of Nigeria Ordered his
release and cleared him of any wrong doing as he has been
languishing in prison for the past three and half years. It was on Monday
23RD September last year that he was finally released to us.

Please we wish to solicit your cooperation as a foreigner to help
us receive some family property / (Money) Deposited with a
Security company which is our only hope / source of livelihood
for now. This is a call for you to help receive this money and
put the money into good investments since we are barred from
leaving the Country for now.

According to my estimation in Western Europe and America alone we
still have over US$70M in cash with Security Companies that we
intend to put in your care by getting a trusted foreigner to
handle money for the purpose of investment and safekeeping abroad.

Please Note that you will be expected to deal directly with the
security company with the information and LEGAL POWER we shall
give you to handle the entire transaction. There is demurrage
accrued over time payable to Security Company to enable
collection of the Consignment, since the Deposit we made at the
time of Deposit has since expired. You must also know that CONSIGNMENT WAS
DEPOSITED AS FAMILY TREASURES, ACTUAL CONTENT ON CONSIGNMENT WAS NOT DECLARED
TO SECURITY COMPANY AT THE TIME OF DEPOSIT TO SAFE GUARD IT. If you can
do this, contact my ATTORNEY, BARRISTER ALI KOLOMA Fax; 234-1-7591936 as
you will be well REWARDED. This is however subject to our negotiation and
agreement.

You can contact me ONLY via our family Attorney, Barrister Ali
Koloma, BY email: palmgroovechambers@winningteam.com for security reason and further
 details.

Endeavor to keep this highly confidential. In your response
include your private telephone / fax numbers for easy
communications with him.

My kind regards,

jubeeg venture <jubeegv@fsmail.net>,jubeegv@fsmail.net,"Sun, 04 Jan 2004 04:26:16 +0100",IMPORTANT PROPOSAL,"Dear Sir,

Re: FIRST TRANSFER OF $6M [Six million] US DOLLAR

I am jubeeg venture, the operational manager in account management section incharge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on
25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard. 

There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since his death , I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.

The total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One hundred and six million United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00
[Six million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.

I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing
his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. 

In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the
transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.

Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer
can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. 

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail or you can call me or fax me VIA: 
TEL:870} 763 648313, {870} 763 648314,
FAX:(870} 763 648315. You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.

Which My bank, now expects a next-of-kin to claim as the beneficiary of the funds, efforts has been made by my Bank to get in touch with the The deceased's Family or relative but to no avail. 

Based on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate The deceased's Family or relative and next-of-kin, the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown account. It is based on this that I have contacted you to stand as the next-of-kin of The deceased or relative so that the funds, will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary /next-of-kin to the deceased. 

All documents, and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as I have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account. It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with 30% of the remitted funds.
 
If this proposal satisfies you, please reach me either by mail or phone: +31 64 920 8093, for more clarification about how this will be done.

Blk. 2681, HLM II,
Dakar - Senegal.
Hello Dear.
Compliments of the season. I am Mrs. Linda johnson, a civil servant from Zimbabwe. I got your contact from Chamber and Commerce office as I was searching for someone who will help me out of my present predicament,My late husband, Mr.Icheke Johnson was the co-owner of an Agricultural firm and his partner happens to be among the white farmers that the dictator President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe took over their farmlands and handed over to the blacks, despite all the pleas from the International Community, and members of the commonwealth country's Most of the company's assets, animal farms and milk industry were seized and confiscated by the tyrant President. 

My late husband was a British citizen of African descent and we both lived in the company's staff quarters but our lives were threatened by agents of President Mugabe. Since then, my husband and I have been living in exile in Dakar - Senegal. My husband died last August as a result of cardiac arrest. A substantial amount of money was deposited in the finance house by my husband before his death through the help of the International Red Cross staff, because President Mugabe, placed order for the closure of the accounts of all the white farmers and no one is allowed to transfer more than ten thousand dollars abroad but luckily enough, I and my late husband along with some other farmers were assisted through diplomatic means with the help of the International Red Cross to send our money abroad. 

The total Sum is THIRTY SIX million US dollars (US$36.000.000.), the money is part of our savings and what my husband inherited from his late father, from whom we took over the family business. The money arrived safely in Europe. All the documents to the deposition of the money are with me here in Senegal and with the Bank also for Security reasons. I would like you to assist me to relocate the money to your country into any account of your choice or keep it for me in your safe custody until I am able to come to your country after my operation soon. I would like to invest the money into any lucrative business, you deem profitable and your assistance is highly needed in the areas of investment feasibility studies. 

Hence I need your cooperation to secure this deposit which is as it stands now, the only hope of my survival as I have already lost my husband, coupled with my sickness and the situation of insecurity. Life is no more the same with me after all the lot I have gone through. Moreover, I wouldn't mind paying you any amount you will charge me up to 20% of the total money for your assistance in relocating and keeping the money for me as well as helping me to carry out proper investment. You keep 80% for me pending execution of the investment. 
As a sick person, it will be difficult to handle this alone, hence I need your immense help, coupled with your distinguished business acumen and track record. Please, I would like you to come to my assistance, I am a lonely widow and in utter confusion and distress. 
This business is solely between two of us and should there be any need for a third party, I will contact one of the Red Cross staff with whom I have established some trust. I am scared that if any one gets to know about this, he might take advantage of my helpless situation. to diverted this fund or seat on the money without helping me to manage it as planed, so please if your willing to help kindly contact me very urgently, 
Sincerely your's,

Mrs. Linda Johnson.

  inno1983@yahoo.com 
  Dear Sir 

Subject: Investment Proposal. Re: Transfer of Fifty Million United States Dollars, (US$50,000, 000.00)

I am Hon. Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking, my agitation is real, and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila, in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually, his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions, as he believed.
As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director, Safety and Security Department, we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad, that will stand as, the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion, since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.
In addition, you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer, but only if, by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself, according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance, which to us is no big deal. The crux of this subject in particular is the declaration of your interest after-which we enter into negotiations with you over the (percentage) issue. Other details of which you may want to know shall be discussed in due course.

Please be kind enough to acknowledge this proposal by responding through the above E-mail address for a high level of confidentiality in this business deal.
Best regards,

Hon. Mr. hope sithole

KEN GOMAN <ukpd@web-mail.com.ar>,R@M,"Sun, 30 Nov 2003 03:08:20 +0100",business  assistance,"For The Attention of: OWNER / CHIEF EXECUTIVE

This is for your urgent attention.  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence as you read this letter.  Though this might come to you as a surprise since we have not met or spoken with each other before.  I plead for your understanding and tender my humble apologies if I had taken you unaware.

My name is KEN AMOBI, a member of the committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to supervise the activities of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), the agency that manages proceeds from the sale of crude oil in my country.  At the inception of the new democratic government in my country, the Petroleum Trust Fund was ordered to wind up its operation to enable the new committee take over.  The former Chairman of the agency in the person of Major General Muhammed Buhari (Rtd.) was also retired.

In its place a new committee in which I am a member was appointed to take over and oversee the activities of the agency. The duty of the committee amongst others includes verifying all outstanding contract claims and debts with the sole objective of settling such long overdue claims.  I therefore decided to contact you directly having gotten your name and company's information from a business handbook of your country I discovered in the former chairman�s official study, which he left behind in his office.

Going through some of the files left behind by the former chairman, we discovered that he has secured out of the Central Bank of Nigeria a forex release to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 for the payment of goods and services supplied by foreign contractors for the execution of KUBUWA WATER PROJECT in the oil rich Niger Delta.  He was trying to transfer the funds to a ghost company abroad when he was removed from office.  In confidence, we know that the goods and services were not supplied but used his office to approve the payment in favour of a foreign firm with no fixed address.  He confided in me as a member of the new committee that he used his position to over invoice the contract.  After his removal from office, this over invoiced amount is floating in the system and left unclaimed.  He has therefore requested me to help look for a foreign company into whose account the funds will be transferred.

I am now soliciting for your cooperation to enable us process the transfer of the funds to your account. You should provide us your company's name or any other name as long as you will be able to receive the amount.  It will be treated as one of the outstanding payments due to you on executed contract.  We will take measure to duly register your company here in Nigeria to give it legitimacy.  We need your company's name and account particulars to enable us file application for foreign exchange allocation order at the Federal Ministry of Finance.  The moment we accomplish this, we will raise Contract Award Certificate in your company's name to show that a contract was actually awarded and executed by you. The nature of your business does not matter.

For your participation and investing in this project, we are prepared to concede 25%of the total sum to you.  On completion of the project, we will commit a substantial percentage of our share into investments in your country and we will direct you on how to repatriate the balance of our share.

I wish to state here again that confidentiality should be our watchword. If the above proposal meets your approval, please respond immediately.

Endeavour to furnish me with your secured private telephone and fax line for easy reach.


KEN AMOBI

I got your contact from the World Trade Organisation
directory of the US,Canada& European Union and I am very
sorry to interrupt your peace since you are not expecting
to receive any mail from me.

However, I was obliged to do so due to the importance and
urgency of the message. I crave your indulgence,and want to
reassure you that I mean well and that it is only for our
mutual good. So please do not be embarrassed.

My name is Mr.Mike Hammer. I am a social worker with an
international-Governmental/Voluntary organization based in

victims of natural disaster, civil wars and Refugees,
displaced/oppressed children and minority people around the
world.

I am just back from Iraq where in the cause of performing
our duties we found a huge amount of cash in an abandoned
Palace, I reached an agreement with the members of my team
whom are UN officials and we agreed to keep this money to
ourselves and then moved the box out of Iraq to Europe
(with their immunity as UN officials they are not searched
at borders or airports). Now, I am in need of a reliable
and trustworthy person or company overseas whom I can
confidently work with since my work does not permit me to
own a foreign bank account or any personal business

information in you and to request for your pleasure to

Please understand that my approach to you is based only on

disappoint or betray me at last. The amount is fairly huge
and we have agreed that on completion of the deal, you will
retain some reasonable percentage of the money(20%)
as a compensation for your assistance.the amount of the
money is FIFTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS
To consider our official positions, reputation and
integrity, especially,the opportunities in the business
itself, it is very necessary that all due care be taken
so that we do not miss the opportunity due to carelessness.

You are therefore expected and advised to display high
degree of maturity,responsibility and understanding in
handling this information.
I will give you all the details in my next mail when you
have indicated your interest and commitment to work with
me. Always remember that this is the highest confidence and
trust any person can repose on the other,
especially when it is considered that we did not know
ourselves before. I hope you will honor me too.

We can come over to join you for sharing and to guarantee
that we have unlimited access to you before and when the
funds hit your account.Moreso for an effective and easy

I am contacting you in view of the fact we will be of great assistance to each other, likewise developing acordial business relationship.I currently have within my reach the sum of Thirty Million United States Dollars ($30,000,000.00) cash, which I intend to use for investment purposes specifically in your country. This money came as a result of a pay-back contract deal between my late husband and a Russian firm in our country's Multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant.

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but 
I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends 
and business partners. My name is William Ansah, the present branch 
Manager of a bank here in Ghana. Like I said, I have a transaction that 
will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required as a 
foreigner.  
 
I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head 
office, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of 
our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the 
present Manager and
discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I 
discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has 
not been operated on for the past 4 years.  From my investigation, I 
found out that this account
belongs to one Late Mr. ANDREAS  SCHRANNER 
a German great industrialist and a resident of Munich, who 
unfortunately lost his life along with his entire famillies in the 
plane crash of CONCORDE AIRLINE [Flight AF4590 ]  which crashed on 25TH 
JULY, 2000. You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this 
site, which I got during my investigation; http://news.bbc.co.
uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm. 

The account is escrow call account, 
a secret type of account in my bank and no other person knows about 
this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other 
beneficiary.  I have kept a close
monitoring of the account since then 
and nobody has come forward to ask about the money as next of kin to 
the late Mr. Andreas Schranner, meaning that no one is aware of the 
account. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to 
influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as 
the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning 
the account, which I shall give you.
 
Contact me as soon as you 
receive this message if you feel we can work
together, so we can go 
over the details.  Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.

You may 
call me through my personal number +233243510543.

Mr. Mark Michelle, a French National. Late Mr. Mark Michelle until his 
untimely death was a private oil consultant/contractor with the Shell 
Petroleum Development Company In Saudi Arabia, hereinafter shall be 
referred to as my client.
 
On 21st April 2000, my client and his wife 
with their three children were involved in a ghastly auto crash; all 
occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then, I 
have made several 
enquiries with his country’s' embassies to locate 
any of my clients extended relatives.  After several unsuccessful 
attempts, I decided to personally contact you with this business 
partnership proposal.
 
 The deceased had a deposit valued presently at 
Eighteen Million United states dollars and the company has issued me a 
notice to provide his next of kin or beneficiary. Having been 
unsuccessful in locating any of my late client relatives for over two 
(2) years now. I am now seeking your consent to present you as the next 
of kin/beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account 
can be paid to you.
 
 I have worked out modalities for achieving my 
aim of appointing a next of kin as well as transferring the money 
abroad for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 35% for you, and 
we shall collectively donate 10% to the Tsunami relief course while 5% 
will be set aside for any incurable expenses both local and 
international.
 
The money transfer paperwork itself will include a 
certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask 
questions. Also the paperwork will include proper certificate that the 
fund being transferred is from non-criminal sources. In short this will 
be a proper and legal money transfer with no risk involved. The 
transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problem. All I need is 
your trust and confidence. Provide me with these information:
 1. Your 
contact phone and fax numbers.

I got your contact when I was making some searches on the internet. My name is Ahmed Abdul Kadir, a sudanese refugee; my Father was until recently, one of the personal aid to the former President of Iraq who was overthrown out of power during the War in Iraq which took many lives. 
I am contacting you to seek your co-operation in investing US$10.5 Million in your country or any other with good economic prospect. My late father was able to safe guard the fund with the contacts he had in the Diplomatic Corps and the funds are being held under the protection and custody of a Diplomat friend of his. I have decided to contact you because I am interested in investing these funds. Please kindly guide and assist me in making the right investment as I am really a novice when considering the technicalities and logistics involved in running a business. 
The details of the investment will be worked out to our respective satisfaction. In view of your participation, I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance, or better still commit it into a viable joint venture. Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the funds belong to me as the only surviving son and as soon as I get your consent, the necessary papers will be drawn up to facilitate the movement to the funds to your country for the investment.

ATTERNATIVE EMAIL(k.kamara@laposte.net)

Dear Director/Ceo
                                       CONFIDENTIAL

Please I am KEVIN KAMARA, the only son of late CHIEF VINCENT KONE KAMARA
from Sierra Leone. I got your contact from the Ecowas Infomation Center
in Côte
d'Ivoire. My sources of your contact gave me the courage and confidence
to rely on you. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek
your assistance to transfer our cash of Ten Million Five hundred thousand
United States Dollars($10,5000,000.00) now in the custody of a BANK here
in Abidjan to your privateaccount pending our arrival to your country.

               SOURCE OF THE MONEY

My late father, chief Vincent Kamara, a native of mende district in the
Northern province of Sierra Leone, was the general Manager of Sierra Leone
mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown. According to my father. This money
was the income accrued from mining co-operation's over draft and minor sales.


Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major Paul
Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost
destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the Civilian
Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already
made arrangement for his family, my mother, my little sister and myself
to be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our
personal effects .

My father deposited the fund for the safe custody
until after the war when he will join us. During the war in my country,
and following the indiscriminate looting of public and Government properties
by the rebel forces, the sierra Leone mining co-op was one of the targets
looted and destroyed.

My father including other top Government functionaries were attacked and
killed by the rebels in November
2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah. As a result of my father death, and with the news of my uncles involvement
in air crash in January, dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths
caused my mothers
heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in
the hospital After we must have spent a lot of money on her.

Now my 16-year-old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering
without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees
and orphans. Our only hope now is in the fund our father
deposited in the BANK. To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance
in the followings ways. To assist me claim this fund from the BANK as co-beneficiary.


To transfer this money in your name to your country. To make a good arrangement
for a joint business investment on our behalf in your country with you as
the caretaker.To secure a college for my little sister and my self in your
country to further our education.
And to make arrangement for our travel to your country after you have transferred
this fund. Most importantly. The whole documents issued after deposit is
in my custody. For your assistance, I beg to concede 10% of this money to
you for your assistance .

Best regards

KEVIN KAMARA AND SISTER.

FROM:  MRS. SUSAN  SHABANGU
SOUTH AFRICA


{MY CONTACT
PRIVATE EMAIL
{susanshabangu00@netscape.net}

{MY SON CONTACT NUMBER+27-73-323-0163} 



Dear Sir,


First, let me start by introducing myself as MRS SUSAN
SHABANGU,a mother of three children and the Deputy Minister
of Safety and Security since 29th  April 1996 to date under
the auspices of the President of South Africa MR THABO
MBEKI.

After due deliberation with my children, I decided to
contact you for your assistance in standing as a
beneficiary to the sum of US$30.5M ( Thirty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) You can view
my profile at my website www.gov.za  click on, Contact
Information, then click on Deputy Minister, and finally,
click on Safety and Security  and read about me. THE
PROPOSAL, After the swearing in ceremony making me the
Deputy Minister of Safety and Security, my husband Mr.
 Ndelebe  Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to
Trinidad and Tobago in 1996.

After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a
dollar account which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a
security and finance institution in South Africa  of which
I will divulge information to you when I get your full
consent and support to go for a change of beneficiary and
subsequent transfer of the funds into you a comfortable and
conducive account of your choice.

 This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced
contract  which he executed with the Government of South
Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but
I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid
that the government of South Africa might start to
investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date. If they
discover this money in his bank account, they will
confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and
this will definitely affect my political career in
government. I want your assistance in opening an account
with bankers through my banker so that this fund could be
wired into your account directly without any hitch. As soon
as the fund gets to your account, you are expected to move
it immediately into another personal bank account in your
country.

 I will see to it that the account is not traced from South
Africa. As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your
account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come
to your country to discuss on business investments. For
your assistance, I am offering you 20% of the principal sum
which amounts to US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars Only)And 5% will be for Any
expenses that both of us may Incure in this transaction.
And another 5%will go for Motherless babes home.
However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into
agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund. If
you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send
me an email. Due to my sensitive position in the South
African Government, I prefer you send me email than call.
All correspondence must be by email to my private email
address, {susanshabangu00@netscape.net} If you want to
speak with my Banker or my elder son,that is fine and okay
by me.you can contact my son on his dilect line
{+27-73-323-0163}his name is {MR Morris shabangu}and You
will have to send down you private telephone /fax number so
that i can forward it to him to reach you from time to time
this is for security reasons. Please I do not need to
remind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality of this
transaction.If you do not feel comfortable with this
transaction, do not hesitate to discontinue. 

 
Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to
your family. 

 
Yours faithfully, 
  

MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU 

Deputy Minister of Safety & Security,

South Africa.

 this search for someone to assist me.
My name is Mohammed Abacha, the heir of the abacha family, and son to 
Sani Abacha, the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently undergoing 
trial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the 
condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some money

 In return, all criminal proceedings against members of my family be

To save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through

 This money has become the only inherited property of our family since  
the government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for 
us by freezing all the family account and has auctioned most of our 
properties.

The money has since been deposited with a private finance and
security firm in Europe. I am willing to offer a percentage agreeable to

Rep.of Senegal
West Africa.

 Dear Beloved One.

 Thank you for giving me your time;Please be patient and read my email to you, this letter might come as a surprise to you,and you could be wondering where I got your contact.
 I got your address through a personal search on the internet for someone relaible and trustworthy,so i decided to contact you for an assistant, which I do hope you will take your time to consider. 
 I am a widow  to the late principal accountant of Sierra Leon central bank who was assassinated due to political hostility in my country.
 For the sake of our lives,my children and i fled to a neighbouring country, Senegal; where we are now seeking refuge.
 I must confess to you,our journey to Senegal was not a jolly ride as we encountered a lot of problems,most painful was a particular situation that left us in a state of penury and where we also lost our travelling documents,thereby making 
it impossible for us to travel now.
 Months ago i was diagnosed with cancer,this futher made our lives more difficult as i am lacking funds to take care of my self and my children.
 I decided to contact you,seeking your assistance because i am having problems recovering a large deposit made by my late husband overseas since the company maintained that instructions left by my late husband the original depositor,states that the funds be ""RELEASED TO ME HIS WIFE OR A FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE ONLY"", believing he would appoint someone by himself to represent him for the claim but unfortunately he died earlier.
 This is the only hope my family has of surviving,paticularly my only son,who has so much dreams and i want to do the best i can to help them fufill thier dreams.
 I am contacting you to help me make the claims by representing my husband as the foreign representative,since i cannot travel to make the claims my self due to my present condition,i am pleading with you to help us claim the funds from the security firm and most importantly, your ability to put the said funds into circulation wisely for our joint interest and relocating my children particularly my son is a major considerable factor regarding my request as my knowledge on financial matters is not enough to handle such amount of fund(us$16,000,000.00) 
sixteen million dollars.
 In view of this, if you are touched to work with me in sincerity, by standing as my late husband,s foreign representative to receive the said deposit on our behalf, we shall embrace you as our family and will compensate you accordingly.
 I am willing to share the money 40% for you,40% for me and my children and the remaining 10% we be set aside for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction,all i really care about now is the welfare of my children.
 As you indicate interest, please contact my son ANTA OMAR on this email address (an_omar07@yahoo.fr)or call him on his phone number Tel: 
+221-4488469  to enable him give you further information relating to the funds and the steps we shall take to finalize on the project,i have handed this project to him as my health conditions makes it hard for me to talk or go around.
 Thanking you in advance for your kind and urgent response, more so for keeping our proposal to your self.

Dr. Ahmed Suleman <drahmedsuleman@excite.com>,,"Wed, 29 Nov 2006 14:36:34 +0100",KINDLY ASSIST.,"Dear Friend,

My Compliment to you,

I guess this letter may come to you as a surprise since I had no  
previous correspondence with you.

I am sending you this mail on behalf of the tender board of the Niger  
Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which is in charge of managing  
and supervising the disbursement of oil sales revenues for the  
Nigerian government which covers payment to foreign and local  
contractors that have executed contracts for our country. The revenue  
under our control runs into several hundred of millions of dollars  
monthly.

We came across your contact in our search for a reliable person to  
handle a very confidential transaction involving the transfer of Nine  
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$9.500m). This  
fund was accrued from various over invoicing of foreign contractors'  
payments made over the years. The contract has long been executed and  
payment of the actual contract amount has been paid to the foreign  
contractor. The balance of the actual contract is what my colleagues  
and I now interested in transferring out of Nigeria into a reliable  
foreign account for our personal use.

As civil servants we are not allowed to run foreign accounts. Hence we  
have chosen you to front and support us as the beneficiary to be paid.  
If you are interested in this proposal, kindly get back to me by  
sending me your letter of acceptance along with your direct telephone  
and fax numbers. For your support and partnership, please reply me to  
negotiate your fees or the percentage you wish to be paid when the  
funds are transferred into your bank account.

Further details about this transaction will be discussed in the  
subsequent correspondence. Note also that the particular nature of  
your business is irrelevant to this transaction and all local contacts  
and arrangements are in place for a smooth and successful conclusion  
of this transaction.

We will appreciate that you treat this proposal with utmost attention,  
knowing fully well that you cannot and will not be compelled to assist  
us if you are not disposed to.

I will be in UK on official assignment probably in a weeks time. I  
can be contacted via this email account drahmedsuleman@gmail.com  I  
will appreciate that you forward to me your contact telephone and fax  
numbers on responding to this mail; I will endeavour to call you for  
detailed discussion on the proposal.

Thank you as I await your response.

Sincerely,

Dr. Ahmed.

Date: 10- 9 - 2005.

Kindest Attention:

My name is Mr. Dave Benton, I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I  cared for.But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of  my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. 

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I  have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Thirty  Million United States Dollars($30,000,000,00) that I have with an Asset Management Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.

N/B:Kindly note that  35% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims,60% to other Charity Organization and 5%  for your effort and time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am using my Lab Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.

God be with you.

               I got your E-mail contact from the AFRICAN LEARNERS ASSOCIATION in one of their seminar held recently in ACCRA-GHANA-WEST-AFRICA. After my series of intensive prayers I decided to write you  and inform you of some quantity of GOLD Dust which is {125KG} and about $19.5 millionUS Dollars I inherited from my late father as the only male survivor son.This item and the fund was deposited in the BANK OF GHANA by my late father before his death, to be withdrawn by his son and his foreign business partner, if unexpected occurs.
              Sir, my message to you is primarily to solicit for your assistance in claiming this item and the fund from the bank of Ghana as my late father""s foreign business partner.
               However, you are only to stand or represent my late father""s foreign business partner to enable us claim the item and the fund from the bank of ghana.
               Note, you are only needed to come down to Accra-Ghana-West-Africa to append your signature as my late father""s foreign business partner before the item and the fund can be release to us.
             I have set-aside 30% out of the total sum for you and 35% commission out of the sale of the Gold is also for you,because of your assistance.
              Remember, your FLIGHT-TICKET will be given back to you, including every other expenses you made in the course of this transaction immediately we claim the item and the  money out of the bank.

{URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)

(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 134,000.000.00 USD 
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ) 

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One
hundred and Thirty four million United States Dollars)
from National Credit Bank (NCB) of South Africa, I want to
ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person
who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to
receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive
this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till
the end for this important business trusting in you and
believing in God that you will never let me down either now
or in future.

I am MR. MATTHEW MOLEFE, the Auditor General in Natinal
Credit Bank (NCB) of South Africa, during the course of our
auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened
in the bank in 1993 and since 1999 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files in
the records I discovered that the owner of the account died
without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Reed H.Huish, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1999. And no
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that Reed H.Huish until
his death was the Reed H.Huish Coy.(pty). SA. 

We will start the first transfer with Thirty four million
[$34,000.000.00] upon successful transaction without any
disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the
payment of the remaining rest amount of($ 100,000.000.00
USD) to your account.

The amount involved is ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One hundred
and thirty four million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $34,000.000.00 [thirty four million
United States Dollar ]from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know
any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money can not be approved to a local person
here, without valid international foreign passport, but can
only be approved to any foreigner with valid international
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the
money is in us dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.
Reed H.Huish is a foreigner too, and the money can only be
approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address from the Girl who
operates computer, I am revealing this to you with believe
in God that you will never let me down in this business,
you are the first and the only person that I am contacting
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your
private telephone and fax number including the full details
of the account to be used for the deposit.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine.Because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information of
this account,which I will give to you, upon your positive
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and
will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is
deeply involved with me in this business. I need your
strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we
can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable
account, which you can provide with assurance that this
money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your
country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all
documents of transaction immediately we receive this money
leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you
can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after
which I will make this remittance in your presence and
three of us will fly to your country at least two days
ahead of the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I
hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this
fund in your account. I will use my position and influence
to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance from the
relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35%
of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be
for expenses both parties might have incurred during the
process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply to phone and fax
number above or[matthew_molefe2003@yahoo.com ]

MR. MATTHEW MOLEFE.

>From Mrs. Elena Owen

London, W8 5DL,

4 Kensington Court,

England.



I am Mrs. Elena Owen, a citizen of Bulgaria but I based in England, I am married to Sir Francis Owen who also is an Englishman though dead now. My husband worked with the British Railways for over two decade before the cold hand of death took him away on the 3rd of June 2005 at about 2:00AM our marriage lasted for over a decade without any fruit of the womb.



My husband died after a protracted illness. My husband and I made a vow to uplift the down-trodden and the less-privileged individuals within the Europe, North and South America, Africa and the rest of the Globe as he had passion for persons who cannot help hemselves due to physical disability or financial predicament. I can adduce this to the fact that he needed a Child from this relationship, which never came.



When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars in a dormant Account in one of the leading security and Finance company in Europe. this money is still with the Finance Company. Presently, am suffering from cancerous ailment for some years now. Recently, my Doctor told me that I have a limited or numbered days on earth and that my life Spam will not exceed 150days due to the cancerous problems I am suffering from.



Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition to the cancer. With this hard reality that has befallen my family, I have decided to donate this fund to a non-governmental, or better still an individual, that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in., that will use this gift which comes from my husbands sweat to fund the upkeep of widows, orphans, destitute, the down-trodden, physically challenged children, barren-women and persons who prove to be genuinely handicapped financially. It is often said that blessed is the hand that gives.



I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are Bourgeois and very wealthy persons and I do not want my husband hard earned money to be misused by his relatives whom have already sold all his landed property. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.



I know that I am going to be with the Almighty when I eventually pass on.The Almighty will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I do not need any telephone communication in this regard due to my deteriorating health and because of the presence of my husband relatives around me. I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. 



I will want you to contact my personal attorney base in Manchester (U.K) on the information stated below, whom I have entrusted every detail regarding this fund.



Name: Barr. Joseph Alford Esq.

Tel/Fax: 44-70-40109983

My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Please always be prayerfully all through your life.



Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a non-governmental, a non-religious, and or a non-profit organization better still an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act just as I have stated herein. Hope to hear from you soon and God bless you and members of your family.

Dr Harry Obum{Deputy Secretary Nigeria Football Association}Please Reply To My Private And Security Email Address: harryobum001@asiamail.com 

Dear Sir,
I am DR HARRY OBUM , Deputy secretary to the Nigerian Football Association, parent body of the World Youths Championship, Nigeria 99'Local Organizing Committee, an affiliate of Federation of International Football Association (FIFA).
 
In the course of our preparation to host the World Youth Soccer Championship Tagged (Nig99) early last four years, huge sum of money running into millions of United States Dollars was budgeted by the then Military Government for the successful organization of this competition.
 In the same vein, FIFA via its President, Mr. Joseph (SEPP) Blatter, made millions of dollars available for the same project, not to talk of Corporate Organizations and Football loving individuals who made huge donations.
 
 However, in my capacity as the deputy secretary, to both the Local Organizing Committee (LOC), and the Nigerian Football Association(NFA), I,along with two of my colleagues in sensitive positions were able to over-invoice most contracts, which were awarded for the construction and the refurbishing of the 8 stadia used for the competition. The contractors who handled these projects have been paid-off.
 It is pertinent to note that a total sum of thirty-two million United States Dollars(US$32,000,000.00) was realized as over-invoice after the successful completion of the project. This over-invoiced sum is lying in my organization's (NFA) suspense account with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), ready for transfer into the beneficiarys account oversea, waiting for the appropriate opportunity to do so. In this years (2003) budget speech, the new Civilian President has ordered that all foreign contractors debts should be paid in order to boost more Foreign investors into Nigeria. On this note, I have been unanimously mandated by my two colleagues to seek an honest and trustworthy Foreigner who will assist in ensuring the successful transfer of the above sum into a personal/company account since the Nigerian code of conduct does not allow us (Civil servants) to operate foreign accounts.
 It is pertinent also to let you know that 30% of the total fund will be for you, while 10% will be used to settle any expenses that might be incurred by both parties and the remaining 60% will be for us (my colleagues and I) to be invested in your country. We have chosen you /your company to benefit with us in this transaction due to the respect your country commands here.
 
These are the necessary requirements we needed from you to complete this transaction:

1. Your bank Name, contact address and your account number where the money will be remitted.

2.Your bank telex, fax and telephone numbers.

3.Your personal phone/fax numbers for easy communication.

The above-mentioned particulars will be used to write LETTER OF CLAIM on behalf of your company from my ministry as the beneficiary of the fund.
You might be surprised and curious of an offer like this, be rest assured that the modalities and logistics towards the successful transfer of this fund has been worked out. All we require from you is your co-operation. This transaction is risk free.
 We kindly request that you accord it the highest level of secrecy it deserves. Email:harryobum001@asiamail.com for security reason.
Your swift response will be highly appreciated.
 Best regards,

susan shabangu <sussy_shab@123.com>,mallam_65@weedmail.com,,RESPOND  URGENTLY PLS. - REF:rf/ntl-fgn,"DEAR SIR/MA,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

After due deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US30.5M Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only)

First, let me start by introducing myself as MRS SUSAN SHABANGU, a mother of three children and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy since 1st April 1996 to date under the auspices of the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI. You can view my profile at my website: www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htm

THE PROPOSAL

After the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 1996.After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar account which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a South African bank which had her offshore House in the CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA

This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date.If they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in Government.

I want your assistance in opening an account with CENTRAL BANK through my Attorney so that this fund could be wired into your account directly without any hitch. As soon as the fund gets to your account, you are expected to move it immediately into another personal bank account in your country. I will see to it that the account is not traced from South Africa. As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your country to discuss on business investments.

SHARING PERCENTAGE

For your assistance, I am offering you 20% of the principal sum which amounts to US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund.

If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email. Due to my sensitive position in the South African Government, I would not WANT you to call me on phone or send a fax to me. All correspondence must be by above mail address.

If you want to speak with my Attorney, that is fine and okay by me. His chambers will be representing my interest at the CENTRAL BANK. All correspondence must be made either to my Attorney Barrister Richard Lithuli, of Lithuli and associates,or send me an email. I will also like you to give me your contact address,telephone and fax to enable my Attorney call or reach you from time to time. 

Please I do not need to remind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality if this transaction must succeed. YOU MUST NOT CALL ME! If you do not feel comfortable with this transaction, do not hesitate to discontinue.

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family.

Yours faithfully,

MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy South Africa.

I am Mrs. Suha Arafat, the wife of Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader who died recently in Paris France.
Since his death and even prior to the announcement,
I have been thrown into a state of antagonism, confusion,
humiliation,frustration and hopelessness by the present
leadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and
the new Prime Minister headed by MAHMOUD ABBAS.
I have even been subjected to physical and psychological
torture.

As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence
with everybody in the country at the moment. You must have
heard over the media reports and the Internet on the 
discovery of some fund in my husband secret bank account 
and companies and the allegations of some huge sums of 
money deposited by my husband in my name of which I have 
refuses to disclose or give up to the corrupt Palestine 
Government.And they are not relenting on their effort to 
make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community 
has no regards for woman,more importantly when the woman 
is from a christian background,hence my desire for a 
foreign assistance.I and my late husband deposited the 
sum of 6.5 million dollars with a Financial firm in 
Europe/Canada whose name is withheld for now until 
we open communication.I shall be grateful if you could 
receive this fund into your bank account for safe keeping 
and any Investment opportunity.This arrangement will be 
known to you and I alone and all our correspondence should 
be strictly on email alone because our government has 
tapped 
all my lines and are monitoring all my moves.

In view of the above, if you are willing to assist for our 
mutual benefits, i promise to give you 30% of the 
$6,500,000 
that will be kept in your position for a while and 
invested 
in your name for my trust pending when my Daughter, ZAHWA, 
will come off age and take full responsibility of her 
Family 
inheritance.Please note that this is a golden opportunity 
that comes once in life time and more so, if you are 
honest, 
I am going to entrust more funds in your care as this is 
one 
of the legacy we keep for our children. In case you don't 
accept please do not let me out to the security and 
international media as I am giving you this information 
in total trust and confidence I will greatly appreciate 
if you accept my proposal in good faith.


Yours sincerely,

Mrs.Suha Arafat

Dear,
 
Due to the on going political crisis in this country (Ivory-Coast-Cote d'Ivoire), I really want to relocate to your country to continue with my education. I was a second year student of Medicine in the university before I lost my parent and since then I have stopped schooling. I have enough money to train myself out of school from an inheritance I inherited from my parent. All I need from you is to accept me and to give me an invitation to help me come over to your country. 
 
I know that this mail may come to you as a surprise. My name is David Djedjess from Congo Republic. But I am presently living in Asylum camp here in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire-Ivory coast. I am 23 yrs old. Since no prearrangement was made before the sudden death of my parents in a motor accident, most of our belonging has been confiscated by my wicked uncles whose love of wealth has driven to lose of common sense. 
 
Since after the sudden death of my parents, I’ve learnt a lesson of the real responsibilities of life. Here I am making vital decisions for my future. I had to contact you regardless of the fact that we have not known each other personal, to assist me as my guardian. I prayed over this issue first before my mind was made up to contact you. I really need your help and assistance to help me move US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen million five hundred thousand United states dollars) over to your country for investment and to enable me to continue with my education in your country. 
 
I expect to hear from you soon. In you reply, please tell me more about yourself, are you married with children? what do you do for a living? Waiting for your prompt response. 
 
Remain bless.
Yours sincerely
David.

Letter From: Daniel Kabila
Johannesburg, South Africa

INVESTMENT OFFER

Greetings,
 In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source 
and the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself, I am Daniel 
Kabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo President Laurent 
Desire Kabila of the blessed memory. I know this letter might come to you as 
a surprise but I honestly do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter 
in respect of my intention to invest the sum of Twelve Million United State 
Dollars with you. I inherited this money from my mother. This money was got 
through the smuggling and sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the 
head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege 
position to engage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows 
that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege 
situation.

When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards 
Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that 
wanted to topple him I escaped to South Africa because of the fear that I 
might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present 
head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of 
relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and 
this ultimately affected us their children. Considering the relationship 
between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo new government, my 
mother advised me to leave For South Africa for security reason, while the 
funds were deposited with a security Company in Europe.

On getting to South Africa where I have been living since then as a 
political refugee I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in 
moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment. Honestly I 
contacted you because I don't want to invest this money in South Africa due 
to my status here as a political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to 
take risk because this money is all that I and my Mother is depending on 
because My half brother has seized all my father's assets and money and left 
I and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at 
the Security Company in Europe so that is why I decided that investing this 
money abroad should be the best investment for me. I will be honored if I 
can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help.

In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to 
respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless 
future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and 
candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total money and annual 5% of 
the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, 
the term shall be varied 5% for expenses, which may arise during the 
transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. When the money is moved into 
your discrete account, you will be allowed to draw 20% your favor, while the 
remaining 70% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in 
your area of business and deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country 
which are dividends yielding. 

Whatever your decision is please reach me immediately and keep this letter 
tight secret for the interest of my family. 

Best Regards,
Daniel Kabila

I hope this meets you in good health. My name is BarristerPhilip Wilson Esq,legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You may follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life:
 
http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml, 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/672849.stm

My late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($25,500,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial bank here in Ivory Coast. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin. 
 
After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me.
 
It was while i was searching for his family records on the internet that i came across your contact.I have searched through almost all the genealogy site that you can think of both in the 
Russia,USA and all the possible places I thought my clients would have possibly had a family member. Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.
 
 
I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account, hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Taxes as your Government may require, I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. 

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.

I am Mark Nguessane from Seirra-Leone I am the son of Chief Nguessane Bakari 
who was the managing director and owner of NGEBAK Import/Export 
company,NGEBAK Logistics company and NGEBAK Glass company here in Abidjan 
Cote d'Ivoire West Africa.

Dear I humbly wish to write you this letter in order that you will assist me 
and my only Sister Cecilia in this money transfer to your bank account in 
your country for investment in a profitable business.

On the 11th october 2004 our late father attended the general meeting of all 
the import/export companies in the country and unfortunately he was poisoned 
by his business rivals and he later died in the hospital.

But before his death,after staying in bed for three days in the hospital,he

leaving nothing behind for us,his extended family members also sent us away 
from his house where we are living and they seized all our house hold 
properties.

We are presently now staying in a hotel here in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire 
because of our lives and the security of the valid documents which the bank

wolny_olkusz@latinmail.com,R@M,"Sat, 20 Sep 2003 01:15:18 +0200",IMPORTANT,"Good Day,



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings,
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will
be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me
since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a
person of integrity.

My name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,
of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,
I decided to contact you through email, after searching
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.



Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This
money was deposited with this Private Security company for
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the
murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security
company from South Africa, has a branch holland and they
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.

I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part
of the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved
in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the
security company from their office in Netherlands,
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you
representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I
have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
($580,000,00) for Charity donation.

If you prefer to accept the 10or assisting with opening an
account,
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want
you
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you
in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my
direct line which is  31-630-854-650 or via email,
wolny_olkusz@latinmail.com




Sincerely,

Wolny Olkusz.

Dear Friend.
Greetings, With warm heart I offer my friendship and I hope this mail meets you in good time, however strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, for I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. I am Mr Patrick F.Massaquoi the son of late formal Liberia sport minister Mr Francois Massaquoi, who was killed while in office in 2001.

After the death of my father, the Charles Taylor control government have been providing my family with security, but resently the united nations and the united state government asked the liberia head of state (Charles Taylor) and members of his cabinet to go on exile. During the tenure of Late Francois Massaquoi,(my father) he enriched and accumulated a lot of money while in office but unfortunately for him he did not leave long to enjoy these wealth.

These funds that were lodged in banks accounts in our country has been frozen. However, my family is not too comfortable with our present government as my late father was a very close aide of Charles Taylor, and on this backdrop the new government might decided to recall the frozen money back to the government purse, with exception of the US$8.5M(Eight million, five hundred United State Dollars)that was deposited in a Finance/security firm undiscovered uptil date. But due to the sanction place on my family by the International community i cannot reach this money myself or withdraw it back to Liberia for use.

We have jointly decided within the family to relocate this funds outside Liberia for investment purpose. This is the only way and means we can utilize this money, consequently, we beg for your assistance in investing this money on real-estate and any other viable venture you might suggest. I got your contact through the internet during my search for a partner and i hope you will not disappoint us in this our time of need. We have also agreed to reward you with 25% of the total amount as your share in this transaction after you might have claim this funds from the security firm.

Finally, i require the following informations to facilitate the documentation that will effect the change of ownership with the Finance firm.
  (a) Your complete names.
  (b) Your mailing address and nationality,
  (c) Your Telephone/Fax numbers.
Again, all arrangement and logistics of this transaction are in place and we shall remain greatful if you can assist us in this our time of need.

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.
Thanking you in anticipations of your kindness while looking forward to hear from you soon.
Best regards,

MR.PATRICK MASSAQUOI.

I am Mr.George Akin,from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the 
course of our auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) 
floating in an account opened in this Bank since 1999 and as 
from 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after 
going through some old files in the records I discovered that 
the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE]sept 11th 2001 
by plane crash, hence the money is floating.

After due verification I noticed that no other person knows 
about this account except his wife who was also invovled in the 
crash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my 
investigation proved to me as well that until his death he was 
the Director GOLD ARK [SARL]
 
Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information about 
his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come 
forward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies 
but up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin 
or relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and 
other officials in my department now decided to make this 
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the 
next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and 
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we 
don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed 
Bill.
 
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used 
as the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And 
the country law here does not allow such money to stay more 
than Five years, for the money will be recalled to the 
government treasury as unclaimed after this period.
Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the 
application form, bank's contact and the next step to take. I 
will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 
hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all 
modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five 
banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the 
deceased.
 
When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail 
signifying your decision.Including your private Tel/Fax numbers 
for quick communication. I will be very happy if you can treat 
this business with the utmost secrecy it demands because of my 
position in this bank.

Hoping for a very successful business relationship with you.

dear friend,
I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department
of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK. I am writing, following the impressive
information about you through one of my friends WORKS WITH THE BURKINA 
CHAMBERS firm.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $U.S15.5Million dollars
(fifteen million five hundred thousand US dolloars)  in an account that 
belongs

to one of our foriegn customer who died along with his entire family in
November 2004  in a plane crash.
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless

some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as
indicated in our banking  guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside  with him at
the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon
this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to
make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next

of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement
since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the
bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
The banking law and guidling here stipulates that  if such money remained
unclaimed after six years the money will be transfered into the bank
treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in
this business is occassioned by the fact  that the customer was a foreigner

and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in
respect  to the  provision of a foriegn account, 10% will be set aside for
expenses occured during the business and 60% would be for me and my
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for
disbursement according  to the percentage indicated.
Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location wherein the money will be remitted.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch  -free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.
You should contact me immediately as soon as you recieve this letter.
Yours faithful
Bill & Exchange Manager.

Dear,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One
hundred and Thirty four million United States Dollars) from
National Credit Bank (NCB) of South Africa, I want to ask
you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who

in God that you will never let me down either now or in

I am MR FRANK DAMAS , the Auditor General in Natinal Credit
Bank (NCB) of South Africa, during the course of our
auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened
in the bank in 1993 and since 1999 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files in
the records I discovered that the owner of the account died
without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Reed H.Huish, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1999. And no
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that Reed H.Huish until
his death was the Reed H.Huish Coy.(pty). SA. 

We will start the first transfer with Thirty four million
[$34,000.000.00] upon successful transaction without any
disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the
payment of the remaining rest amount of($ 100,000.000.00
USD) to your account.

The amount involved is ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One hundred
and thirty four million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $34,000.000.00 [thirty four million
United States Dollar ]from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know
any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money can not be approved to a local person
here, without valid international foreign passport, but can
only be approved to any foreigner with valid international
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the
money is in us dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.
Reed H.Huish is a foreigner too, and the money can only be
approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address from the Girl who
operates computer, I am revealing this to you with believe
in God that you will never let me down in this business,
you are the first and the only person that I am contacting
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your
private telephone and fax number including the full details
of the account to be used for the deposit.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine.Because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information of
this account,which I will give to you, upon your positive
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and
will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is
deeply involved with me in this business. I need your
strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we
can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable
account, which you can provide with assurance that this
money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your
country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all
documents of transaction immediately we receive this money
leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you
can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after
which I will make this remittance in your presence and
three of us will fly to your country at least two days
ahead of the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I

fund in your account. I will use my position and influence
to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance from the
relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35%
of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be
for expenses both parties might have incurred during the
process of transferring.

CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON, A 
FOREIGNER WHO DIED IN A PLANE CRASH WITH HIS INTIRE FAMILY.

REPLY ONLY TO MY PRIVATE E-MAIL  mr_a_allahim001@yahoo.fr


THE FUND HAS BEEN IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THE BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND 
IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO 
THIS DEVELOPMENT.ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY, I KEPT THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN 
MYSELF TO ENABLE THE WHOLE PLANS AND IDEA BE PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL 
DURING THE TIME OF EXECUTION. THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS USD$10.500,000 (TEN 
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS.) MEANWHILE THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT 
AND DIRECTIVES NEEDED TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO THE 
DECEASED, WILL BE FORWARD TO YOU UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE. INFORMATION WILL BE 
RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO 
ASSIST ME AND ALSO BENEFIT YOURSELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS 
COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT, WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT 
AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF 
TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL 
REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN 
TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE HE
WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS REQUEST AS IT MAY BE, 
AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION TO DESIGNATED BANK ACCOUNT.

TOTAL SUM WHILE 60% WILL BE FOR ME. YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO KEEP TOP SECRET 
AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER I CONCLUDE 
THIS DEAL WITH YOU.

I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THE BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM 
THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR 
SUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED 
AND FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY YOU MAY 
ADVICE ME TO INVEST IN. ALL OTHER NECESSARY INFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU

DR. BELLO MUSA
N N P C.




ATTN,

     MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL


I am Dr. BELLO MUSA.The chief accountant of The 
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I
head five man tender board in charge of contract award
and payments approvals.I came to know of you in my 
search for a reliable person to handle a very
confidential transaction which involves the transfer
of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by aconsortion
of multinationals in the oil industry in favour of
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among
which were for the following:-1. The expansion of the
pipelines network within for a crude down stream
products distribution and subsequent evacuation:- $8,
Billion United States Dollars.2. Contract for the turn around maintenance
(TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States
Dollars.
3. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum
products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.

The original value of these contracts were delebrately
over invoiced in the sum U$69,000.00 (sixty nine Million
United States Dollars Only) which has now been
approved and is now ready to be transferred, being
that the companies that actually executed these
contracts have been fully paid the projests officially
commissioned.It does not matter whether or not 
your comapny does contracts project of that nature
described here, the assumption is that your company
won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to
other companies.

Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to
transfer the total  amount to your account for subsequent disbursement,
since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau
(civil service laws) 
from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our
names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at
this junction enormous. In return, we have agreed to
offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall
be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and
external) between the parties in the course of the
transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,The
Nigerian  officials.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the ministry of finance and the central bank of
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within
14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the
above stated terms.Our assurance is that your role is risk free,
I accord this transaction the legality it
deserves and for mutual security of the fund, the
whole approval procedures will be officially and
legally processed with the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the
above mentioned amount.

Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we
shall through our same connections withdraw all
documents used from all the concerned government
ministries for 100% security risk free.Once more, I
want you to understand that having put in over 19
years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful
to have my image and career deemed.

Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether
you are or not interested in this deal, if you are
not, it will enable us scout  for another foreign partner
to carry out this deal but where you are interested 
send the required documents.One blank letter head, one
invoice sheet and your bank particulars through my
above address as time is not on our side in the business.
Send by Email for security reasons.

Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest
co-operation.

Very truly yours,

Dr. bello musa

My name is Daniel Williams and I am an artist.I live in Netherlands,with my two
kids, four cats, one dog and the love of my life. It is definitely a full
house. I have been doing artwork since I was a small child. That gives me about
23 years of experience. I majored in art in high school and took a few college
art courses. Most of my work is done in either pencil or airbrush mixed with
color pencils. I have recently added designing and creating artwork on the
computer.I have been selling my art for the last 3 years and have had my work
featured on trading cards, prints and in magazines.I have sold in galleries and
to private collectors from all around the world.I am always facing serious
difficulties when it comes to selling my art works to Americans,they are always
offering to pay with a US POSTAL MONEY ORDER,which is difficult for me to cash
here in Netherland.

I am looking for a representative in the states who will be working for me and
will be willing to pay %10 for every transaction,which wouldnt affect ur
present state of work,someone who would help me recieve payments from my
customers in the states.These payments are in money order and it will be made
payable to your name, so all you need do is cash the money order deduct your
percentage and wire the rest back.

It wouldnt cost you any amount,you are to receive payments which will be sent
by my customers to you via fedex.

Abidjan.Cote d'Ivoire.

Attn:The President

Dear Sir,

I write to solicite your assistance and support to enable me execute a  very 
lucrative and high profiting business transaction.I am very  sure that with 
trust and understanding,we will be able to execute this busines to our 
mutual benefit and believe that you will not let down the  trust I am 
willing to repose in you.

I work for an Ivorien based import and export firm (""a-MIC""), I work product 
sourcing manager. Between the 17th -19th of may, 2002 a  business seminar 
was held in BOUAKE Cote Divoire  of which I attended.While in the Seminar, I 
was opportuned to meet ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD ,the President of 
ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & CATTLE FARMS ETS. ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD isan 
accomplished and widely known and recognised millionaire farmer in this part 
of the region. He has cattle farms in different  countries. Above all, he is 
one of the greatest supplier  of cattle,beef and other diary products in 
this part of the coast.On getting to know my proffesion, ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI 
MAHMOUD took me into confidence by informing me about the purchase of a 
particular but very  important medicine for his cattle. He informed me that 
he buys this  product at $5,000.00 USD per carton, and that he mostly buys 
to the excess  of 450 cartons. He informed me that he would like me to find 
out if my organisation could source for him a cheaper supplier considering 
the  recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market  
which is affecting his business.

Back in my office, I discussed this proposal with my boss and he  decided to 
handle the  supply by himself.We carried out a market research and  
discovered that we could purchase this medicine somewhere cheaper in EUROPE 
for $2,000.00 USD per carton . We moved a proposal to ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & 
CATTLE FARMS ETS. to make the supply to them at $4,800.00 USD per carton of 
which  he accepted. Owing to my role in the transaction, I had an agreement 
with my  director to be receiving 15% of whatever gain is made on each 
supply of which he agreed. But on the completion of the suply and the 
receipt of the payment, my boss renegated on our agreement and refused to 
give me my  share of the profit. Since then our relationship has been at its 
lowest  ebb. I have since accepted it as one of life experiences.

However, as God would have it, recently, I ran into ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI 
MAHMOUD and he informed me that he would want us to urgently supply him  
with 1250 cartons of the same product before the end of Dec 2006.I  used the 
oppurtunity to inform Alhaji that I can  introduce him to the main producer 
of this vaccine who can supply him  the product at $4,400.00 USD if he will 
pay in advance as he usually  does. He was very pleased and has assured me 
that he is not going to contact my boss again for this vaccine. He is  now 
waiting for me to link him to the producer of
the vaccine. We will buy the medicine at $2,000.00 USD from EUROPE and sell 
at  $4,400.00 USD TO ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD,with him making a down 
payment of  50% of our quoted price first.

If you are interested and capable of handling this supplies on my 
behalf,kindly get back to me urgently through my e-mail,so that we can agree 
on the terms and profit sharing,after which I can then furnish you with the 
contacts of both our source in EUROPE and that of ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI 
MAHMOUD . Kindly be notified that at no point in time should you let  ALHAJI 
NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD know that you are not the producer of the medicine and 
we  should never allow him to know the
contact of our real source in EUROPE  so that he would'nt bypass us to deal 
directly with them.

Thanks for your cooperation.
Yours sincerely,

MR KONAN ALAIN

PLEASE MAIL BACK

My Dearest ONE
May the peace of gracious God be with you,please I have a problem which I 
needed a help from you,I have decided to write you for help.

I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any 
manner compel you to honour against your will.

I am in a state of delinma and made up my mind to send you this mail , I am 
ROSLINE MATHEW ,21 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr. 
and Mrs. MATHEW NZOBEl.

My father was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa merchant) who 
operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of 
his bus iness trips abroad on 12th.Febuary 2004.

Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been 
masterminded by an
uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.

But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and 
since then my father took me so special.

Before his death on February 12 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied 
him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of eight million, seven 
hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) left in one of the 
leading security company.

He further told him that he depaosited the money in my name, and finally 
issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of 
all the necessary legal documents to this fund and the security company .

I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know 
what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result o 
f incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father 
actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble 
assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly 
regarded.

Now permit me to ask these few questions:-

1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter?

2. Can I completely trust you?

3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you 
after the money is in your account?

Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.

Thank you so much.Mey God bless you and your family.

My sincere regards,

ROSLIN MATHEW

     (RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}  
    {ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)  

Hello,
  
We want to transfer to overseas (126,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Twenty six million United States Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to quietly provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c 
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in you and believing  in God that
you will never let me down either now or in future

I am Mr.Nelson Abia,the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993.
and  no other person knows about this account or any
thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager 
Morris  Coy.(pty). SA.  

  
We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account, 

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and
Twenty Six million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip Morris is a foreigner too, [and the money can only
be approved into a foreign a/c].

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer, I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business, you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately

this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%

Director of Projects, DME, South Africa.

I am Dr. John Mikado, Director of projects Implementation South Africa Department of Minerals & Energy. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach  you for a transaction / business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to count on you as a respected & honest person to handle this transaction with sincerity, trust & confidentiality. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep confidential because of the nature of the transaction.

Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I work as a director of projects Implementation and with the co-operation of three other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling 28.5million US dollars. which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a company or individual to receive the said funds on our behalf. We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the said funds, More so, we are handicapped in the circumstance as the South Africa Civil Service code of conduct does not allow us to operate foreign account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount (US$28.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance of the US$28.5m. which we have in principle gotten approvals from the Department of Finance and the contract review and payment committee to transfer by telegraphic transfer to any bank account you will provide. It does not matter whether you or your company does contract projects as a transfer of power and privileges with details & change of information upon application to reflect payment in favour of  you or your company will be secured on behalf of you or your company.

I have the mandate of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be US$7.125m 25% of the US$28.5 million, US$19.95m 70% for us and US$1.425m 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe and secure, on your part provided you treat it with ultmost confidentiality. Also, your area of trade or specialization is not an hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Please, endeavour to contact me immediately through my email for further clarifications.

I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in the position to make the payment of this funds possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential, and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Best Regards,

here in Nigeria.All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their 
lives.

Since then I have made several inquires to German Embassy to locate any

unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to track his last 
name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but could 
not locate them.

I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property 
left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the security company where this huge deposits were lodged.

Particularly,the Europe based security company where the deceased had 
deposited about(US$25M)Twenty Five Million United State Dollars has 
issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the funds confiscated 
within the next 21 working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 8 
months now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the 
deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at (US$25M) can be 
paid to you and then we 
can share the money.All necessary legal documents will be in place that 
can be used to back up any claim we may make.

All I require is your honest cooperation and transparency to enable us 
see this deal through.I can guarantee that this will be executed under 
a 
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the 
law.Please do get in touch with me through my confidential e-mail address:

The account has no beneficiary and no other person knows about this
account.

I am in close contact with the bank manager here who is my partner and is
willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner
with foreign bank account because the former owner of the a/c is a
foreigner. The account has no writen or oral WILL attached to it. I will
provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim
this money if you agree to receive this fund in your account pending my
arrival in your country for sharing and on receipt of your Bank Account
Details where the fund will be transferred. 

We will start with FIFTY SIX MILLION POUNDS. At the end, 65% will be for
me, 25% for you and 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred on both
sides during the transfer.Another 5% will go to the charity. There is no
risk involved as every arrangement has been perfected. 


YOU CAN CONTACT ME.


Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Andy Hornby.

MRS SUSSAN ADAMS <sunyynz@internet.com.uy>,,"Tue, 26 Sep 2006 23:52:46 -0300","DEAR BELOVED,","
DEAR BELOVED,

I am Sussan Adams

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above named
person. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I?m now in Nigerian
General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U.S embassy
in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were  
married for
eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for
only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his
death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home
which the Bible is against.

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten
Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this  
money is
still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently,  
my Doctor
told me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer
problems.

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decided
to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individual
That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a
church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows
propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.
The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took
this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and
my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this
money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold
decision.

I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going
to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight
my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in
this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's
relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.
With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward
your personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address,  
with Your
telephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal
owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your
nominated Bank Account in your country.

I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as  
the real
next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and  
the church
to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me
that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to
serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful
all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching
for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me
that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as
soon as possible.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

Yours in Christ,

Mrs. Sussan Adams

It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,Having known the
truth, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight
of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of Gods
mercy and glory upon my life.
I am Mrs Melissa Pointer the wife of Mr Harry Pointer, my husband
worked with the Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died
in the year 2001.We were married for ten years without a child.
My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.
Before his death we were both born again Christians.
Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of US $3.5M. (Three Million Five Hundred
Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe.
Presently, this money is still with the Bank and the management just
wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of
this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to
receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.
Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing
treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk
and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is
my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any
where in the World.
Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since
my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge
responsibility to any of them.
Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand
and collect the Funds from the Bank.
I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund
churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to
ensure that the house of God is maintained.
The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit
this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want
my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.

because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's relatives
around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.
With God all things are possible.

URGENT ATTENTION

I am Dr. Mogogo Mogul, Chairman of Contract Award and Verification Panel set up by the Nigeria Ministry of Aviation. I got your contact from the net during my personal search ,after thorough deliberations,my colleagues and I decided to contact you for a very confidential business transaction of mutual benefit.

During our verification exercise, we came across an over-invoiced contract(Contract No: FMA/PED/1473/96). This contract was awarded in July,1996 and completed in August, 1998, and the original contractor has since been paid his contract sum leaving the over-invoiced sum of US$25.5m(Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) This amount have been left floating in our account with the federation bank, until our recent discovery.

My coleagues and I have decided to seek for the assistance of a reliable foreign partner into whose account the fund will be transferred into for our own use. If this proposal is acceptable to you, a “Deed of Transfer” of the above contract will be obtained on your behalf, to empower you as the legal beneficiary of the contract and the sum to be transferred. All necessary and relevant documents will be procured for the release and transfer of the fund into your nominated account.
An application for foreign exchange allocation will be made on your behalf from my office to the federal ministry of finance (FMF) and the federation bank for the subsequent release and transfer of the fund into your nominated account.Be informed that we are working in collaboration with top officials of the federal ministry of finance and the federation bank, who will assist us in the transfer of the fund. With your cooperation the success of this transaction is guaranteed.

We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum, 70% will be for me and my colleagues here, while the remaining 5% have been mapped-out for miscellaneous expenses that might be incurred by both parties during the course of this transaction. All things being equal, this transaction will be concluded within 6 working days upon the day of receipt of your response. You are required to email us your nominated bank account details and your direct telephone and fax numbers. Please treat this transaction with top priority and remember to keep it as confidential as possible.

As soon as we receive your response, more details about how to proceed will be given to you. Best Regards,

DR. Mogogo Mogul Chairman,

MR TUNDA <tundatx@zapo.net>,tundatx@zapo.net,"Fri, 21 Mar 2003 17:54:04 +0200",HELLO,"FROM : MR TUNDA USENI
 EMAIL ADDRESS: tunda@zapo.net

 URGENT BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP

 ATTENTION:PRESIDENT/C.E.O

      Dear Sir, My name is MR TUNDA USENI the eldest son of Rtd General
 JEREMAIAH. J. T. USENI who was the est. while Minister of the Federal
 Capital territory Abuja in the late General Sani Abacha\\\\\\'s Regime of
 1993-
 1998. I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost confidence and
 trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60M that is
 presently putting my entire family into great disarray. You may be quite
 surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, I got your
 contact from a business site on the internet and following the
 information I gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be of
 assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once due to the urgency
 required for us to immediately transfer the said funds out of the
 country. During the time my father was in the government with the late
 General Sani Abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in
 several deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the
 deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation
 of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the Nigerian Defense, funds set to
 embark on an oversea campaign to counter the United States action to put
 a stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s government to
 retain
 power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum
 Refineries and the National Electric Power Authority which supplies
 Electricity to the entire nation. If you are conversant with world news,
 you would understand better. During this period my father was able to
 make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts.
 The then head of state General Sani Abacha transferred his share of the
 money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman,
 Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all the secrets
 were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive
 governments and most of the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s loots were traced and
 repatriated
 from the various accounts to the Federal Government Treasury. Out of the
 money my father made, he left the sum of N50 Million (Fifty Million
 Naira) in the CBN escrow account for further transfer into a foreign
 account and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in a Private
 security firm here in Nigeria. Through the confessions made by the
 Abacha\\\\\\'s Family, the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating
 agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to discover the $60M,
 which he kept in the vaults. The reason is because no names were used to
 lodge in the funds. Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS
 (PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also
 the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments.
 Note that I have these information in my custody. Right now, my father
 has been arrested and detained for interrogation. As the eldest son of my
 Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to ensure
 that the $60M is successfully transferred abroad for investment purposes.
 With the present situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based on
 this that I am making this contact with you. I have done a thorough
 homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to
 the funds and effect the transfer accordingly. Is rest assured that the
 modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our
 safety and the successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be
 absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.
 If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email
 for more details. Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again.
 All my fathers\\\\\\' friends have deserted us after exploiting us on the
 pretence of trying to help my father. As it is said, \\\\\\""it is at the time
 of problems that you know your true friends\\\\\\"". So long as you keep
 everything to yourself, we would definitely have no problems. For your
 assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds
 after transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable
 business you may suggest. Please, I need your assistance to make this
 happen and please; do not undermine it because it will also be a source
 of up liftment to you also. You have absolutely nothing to loose in
 assisting us instead, you have so much to gain. Awaiting your urgent and
 positive response.

 BEST REGARDS,


 MR TUNDA USENI

Mr.Titus J. Morris <moritz10@virgilio.it>,,"Fri, 03 Feb 2006 09:55:27 +0100",From the Auditor ,">From the Auditor 
Head of the Department,
First Commercial Bank
29 
Wilson Street,
London. EC2M 2SJ.

Dear Friend,
I am Titus James Morris 
auditor with First Commercial Bank,United Kingdom. And for reasons 
which will become obvious to you as you read on, I obtained your 
address particulars from an internet address listing. Please exercise 
some patience and read through my message. 

I have a very urgent and 
Confidential Business Proposition for you. On June 6th 1999, a Gold 
Consultant/Contractor with the British National Gold Corporation, Mr. 
Ahmed Yousef Mustafa, a National of Kuwait, made a numbered time 
(Fixed) Deposit for 12 calendar months, value £12,500,000.00 (Twelve 
Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in my branch. 

On 
maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but 
got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his 
contract employers, the British national gold corporation wrote to 
inform us that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa died on an automobile accident; 
that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next 
of kin through the Kuwait Embassy were fruitless. 

At first I was 
surprised that i did not receive much official cooperation in my 
inquiries in order to trace his kin in Kuwait, and inform them about 
Mr. Mustafa deposit of (GBP12.5m) plus accrued interest. I therefore 
made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Ahmed Yousef 
Mustafa had
actively opposed the government of his country Kuwait,and 
was consequently driven into exile. Being a mining expert, he 
subsequently obtained a job with the British national gold corporation, 
and settled in London. 

Thereafter, he walked into my office to make 
the aforementioned deposit of (GBP 12.5m).He did not declare any kin in 
his application paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and wheni 
asked him he informed me that he wished it so. I accepted his 
application because banks are conservative and will always honour a 
customer'swishes, especially high networth customers. 

My proposal 
therefore is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the 
next of kin to Mr.Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation 
to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to 
come from the same country. I have workedout the modalities to achieve 
my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore, also by this means 
transfer this money total £12.5m abroad for us to share. 

Once you 
indicate your interest, I will initiate the processing of the transfer 
and in about 14 working days the money total £12.5m will be in your 
nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 
30% for you. 

Thanks and God bless,

Looking forward to your urgent 
reply.

Mr.Titus James Morris.

Sir,

I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in you, for me to have contacted you even though we've not met before.

My name is Martin Goudalé,the only son of late Mr.Hassan Goudalé, who was the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries plc.SCAFECAO)""Bouake"" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.

You can find the story on this
website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm

On 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.

After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only)in a Finance House and also told her where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.

That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 20%of the total amount for your assistance .

Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce to the Finance House where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer.

I am waiting for your response.
Thanks and God bless.

SUZANA NUHAN VAYE and my Son MUSA NUHAN VAYE, we are from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My late Husband MR. ISSAC NUHAN VAYE, was then Deputy Minister of Public Works during President Charles Taylor regim in Liberia. My Husband was falsely accused of plotting coup to remove the then President of Liberia (Charles Taylor) from office. Without trial, President Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web site below:

Two days before his arrest, he managed to sneak out a written message informing me about one trunk box of valuable, containing money which he had concealed under the roof. He instructed me to take our only son and move out of Liberia immediately to Bangkok Thailand, I become a widow overnight, helpless situation without a partner. At that moment of calamity, every persons was running for his and her life. My son and I manage to escape through the help of an airline to Bangkok with the box and some vital documents property title. 

The cash involved in the box is Nine Million, Three Hundred Thousand United State Dollars (US$9.3M). Due to fear and limited rights as refugee, I deposited the box with a private security organization in order not to raise an eyebrow over the box here in Bangkok. My son's name is MUSA NUHAN VAYE and we are temporary residing in Uttaradit in the northern part of Thailand as assylum seekers. Be inform that the real content of the box was not disclosed to security company for security reasons.

I apologized using this medium to reach you for a business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.

I seek your assistance to accommodate the sum of US$23M (Twenty three million (US) dollars) for us, and the need is very urgent. I will reward you with 20 percent of the fund for your assistance.

My Boss got arrested for his involvement in politics in financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov), which posed a threat to President Putin Leadership, and was charged with Tax invasion, just to get him out of the way.

The Russian Government had already concluded plans to frozen all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal before I connived with an high ranked official of YUKOS OIL,(who is also my partner in this business) to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe a foreign contractor the sum of 23m US dollars which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations, by the Government of Russia.

YOUR ROLE:
My contact in Yukos Oil will present you as the foreign beneficiary of the above stated sum. He will also arrange for the documentation which the payment center will need to transfer the sum to you. 

The business is 100% safe, Also, your area of trade or specialization is not an hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.

  Greeting, 
I solicit your confidence in this transaction that I propose to you. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. 
Your discreteness and ability to handle a transaction of this nature is of the uttermost importance. 
  Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.My name is  Mr Mike Charles Kobi, I'm the Son of late COL. JOHNSON KOBI (The assistant chief of general staff of sierra Leone�s revolutionary united front R.U.F) and at the crown Prince of kuloma village in the south � west district of sierra Leone; who died on the 29th of august 2000 with some of his colleagues during the war in my Country.

  I came to know of you in my �private� search on the Internet for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. In brief, I have the sum of Nine million, two hundred thousands US dollars (9,200,000:00 U.S. dollars). This money was deposited by my late father in a high secured security company here in Dakar - Senegal, of which I was made the sole beneficiary along side with my aged mother. 
Because of the present situation in my country sierra Leone, I decided to leave the country immediately because of some security reasons and also to look for a trust worthy and reliable person(s) who can assist us to transfer this money out of Dakar Senegal based on the agreement that was signed by my late father and the security company before his death. 
As a Young Man, I pray that you being a kind hearted person(s) will surely help me to transfer this money to your country and also to assist in investing it in a profitable business which will yield more money.  I feel that I can confide in you , hoping that you will not betray me. 
  I have proposed twenty per cent (30%) of this money to you, so as for you to give all necessary assistance and protections we need in your country, 60% for us and 10% for the expenses which both will incurred as a result of this transaction. 
  Please treat as highly confidential because our future depends  on this money being the only thing that we have after running away from our country. 
  All the vital documents covering this deposit in the security company are with me here in Dakar Senegal and will be faxed to you on demand after I certify that you are worthy to do business with. The reason I searched for you importantly is because, based on the agreement made by my late father and the security company that simply stipulates that in case of his death, his money should be transferred out of Africa. 
   I would like to secure my money in your care as I have decided to order a command to the security company to transfer the money to you depending on your urgent reply to my request and my assessment of your person. Note that this transaction demands the highest trust and confidence between the two of us. Moreover, it is risk free in the sense that I have taken proper care of all formalities regarding this transaction. 
If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not hesitate to contact me Mike Charles Kobi by writing to the above mail address.You can reach me with my aternative mail at(macdani500@hotmail.com) You will have to send your most confidential Telephone/Fax numbers so that I can relay confidential information - as they will come in directly to you.

Thank you. God Bless.

From: Mr Usman Zongo African Development Bank (ADB)Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso .  Dear Friend, I Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept At African Development Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa . In my department we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, Six Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash the year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board. Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unless someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or fund. The bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.In subsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me.As soon as the money hit into your account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above. To make the claim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for easy and effective communication. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Hoping to hear from you immediately. Thanks.Usman Zongo

ATTN:
   
  In order to transfer out (US$90 Million)niety million United States Dollars) from ALL TRUST BANK (AT).I have picked-up the trust and courage to write you this letter with devine confidence that you are a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important business transaction believing also that you will never let me down either now or in the future. 
   
  My name is dr morries adams a senior Auditing Officerwith the ALL TRUST BANK in South Africa. There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Fernando Carlos, a foreigner, he was a miner at Kruger gold company, a geologist by profession, and he died since 1990. 
   
  No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (US$90 million)niety million United States Dollars. 
   
  I want to first transfer (US$45 Million)forty five million United States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am contacting you based on the fact that you are a foreigner because this money can only be approved for payment to a foreigner, more so it can not be approved by any local bank here, as this money is in US Dollars hence the former owner of this account is a foreigner too.

  I have involved a very senior official in the operational department and we have agreed that after the transfer of the money into your account, you shall
be entitled to 25% of the total sum, we the officials will take 70% while 5% is for expenses. All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a risk free
situation on the side of the both parties. Please note that this deal can only take place on the following conditions:-

Hello,

It may come to you as a surprise hearing from me, but
to be precise I got your data from the your e-mail
site member directory in my search for a competent
business manager/hard working person who is willing
and able to be my friend and partner, to liaise with
me in order to
execute a project which I am convinced that you are
capable and trusted to do this business with me.

I am Mark Luke, 32 years old and good looking man, and
I am from  River State of Nigeria. I have B.SC in
Public Administration and I work with GLOBAL SECURITY
& FINANCE LTD. I  have now developed the interest in
having a business investment outside Nigeria without
my employers knowing about it. Hence I contacted you
for friendship and business relationship.

The fund in question proposed for this project is
US$14.8million(Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred
Thousand Dollars Only), which I will like you to
receive it on my behalf and to invest it in your
business or in any business that you think will be
profitable in your country.

Please Note: This fund have been under a suspense
account pending the time it will be claimed by the
owner. It came as a result of a multi-natinal company
that we helped to secure an oil drilling contract some
years ago and after the contract, the company got paid
and went back to their country leaving behind this
over-inflated sum for me and my colleagues to claim.

Now the time has come for me to process and move the
fund out for investment, but I can not do it on my own
since I am still working with the Global Security &
Finanace Ltd. This is why I need your help so that I
can use you or your company to process the release of
the fund as if you are reciving a payment of an
executed contract.

Please let me know about yourself/company and also let
me know if you can be able to receive the money on my
behalf and invest it in your company or any good and
profitable business in your country without exposing
me, so as to give you all the details needed to make
the money transferred to you. 

Your share will be 40% for your assistance, while I
will take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses
that will be incurred in the cause of transfer.

Please write back if only you know you are capable
enough to execute this project with me.

Please this transaction requires utmost
confidentiality. My alternative Private email address
is: markluke2@bareed.com           
  
Looking forward to your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
Mark Luke

CHIEF SABASTIAN GOMEZ <chiefantonio_gomez@virgilio.it>,,"Fri, 17 Dec 2004 09:07:54 +0100",HELLO,"
    DEAR PARTNER.
I am  Sabastian Gomez. an auditor and accountant with a bank here in Afica
Nigeria precisely.
There is a fixed deposit of £15,000,000.00 ( Fifteen Million Pounds Starling)
made to this bank since 1994 which is ten years now and since
then no claim or withdrawal have been made on this
deposit. Fortunately, I have been the person working on
the interest from the day of deposit to date. The
interesting part of it is that the fixed deposit
belongs to the late John Hughe a forigner, a civil engineer by profession.this
means that the account may have been
abandoned by the surviving family members or that they
are not even aware of the existence of the deposit.
 


However, I just finished updating the interest of the
deposit this october, and it has come up to
£37,000,000.00 at the 3% interest rate per annum. It
is this interest that I am interested in because I
know very well that the family will care less on what
happens to the interest if they  want to redeem the
deposit, they will be interested on the main money,
that is if they are able to claim it at all because all
the money lodged into different banks here in Arica are now been claimed
by the Nigerian government.


Meanwhile, my plan is to withdraw just some amount
from the accumulated interest and transfer it to a foreign account. which
will not even
affect the main fixed deposit. I will give you the
details of procedure and my full ID when I receive
your reply and indication of partner. Your reward and
amount to withdraw will be our mutual agreement to
avoid any misunderstanding.

We have noting to lose, we only courage to do this. 

Sincerely yours,

BANK AUDITOR.
SABASTIAN.

transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the 
transaction ,During our investigation and auditing in the bank, in my 
department I came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased 
person, a foriegner who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant 
in his account with the bank without any claim of the fund in our custody 
either from his family or relation before my discovery to this 
development,Although personally, I kept this information secrete within 
myself and  to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and uccessful 
during the time of execution.

United State Dollars ). Meanwhile, all the whole arrangement and directives 
needed to put claim over this fund as the next of kin to the deceased, Upon 
your acceptance all the information will be forward to you as soon as you 
indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your 
self to this great business opportunity,In fact, I could have done this deal 
alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are 
not allowed to operate a foriegn account and would eventually raise an eye 
brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank, 
this is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who 
will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of Oath to 
the bank and also present a foriegn account where you will need the said 
fund to be transferred into, after due verification and clarification to 
designated bank account,I will not fail to inform you that this transaction

monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm the money 
in your account and ask me to come down there for subsequent shearing of the 
fund according to percentages previously indicated and further 
investment,either in your country or any other country you may advice me to 
invest in.

"K.M.ZONDI@foxfire.mr.itd.UM, revmzondi@netscape.net",R@S,"Fri, 28 Nov 2003 17:50:30 +0100",THIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION!,"Hello my beloved kind hearted,

 

THIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION!

 

I simply want to take this occasion to tell you about my intention to contribute toward the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and I need your help as my representative overseas. I need you to receive my financial entitlements from my financiers overseas on my behalf for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and hope you would not let me down.

 

It might interest you to know that in my supporting role to the Minister of Public Works here in Pretoria, South Africa it is my responsibility to handle some very intrinsic matters for, on behalf or with the Minister. By my duties, it is almost impossible for any file/Contract Proposals to get to the Minister for approval, without it passing through my scrutiny.

 

By my religious status and as the South African Deputy Minister of Public Works, I have cause to help a lot of foreign contractor-companies (mainly American) to secure the release of their entitlements from the coffers of the government of South Africa. I did this, principally, as a help to the concerned companies, but in appreciation of my efforts, most of them committed themselves to paying some handsome monetary honorarium to me. However, because of my position as a political appointee, it is impossible for me to collect such money immediately or even directly. Hence, I need you to collect this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further directed for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS. Of course your effort will not be in vain. You would be well rewarded for your help in this regards.

 

All the money from the various companies put together is totaling amount to Eight Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand United States Dollars (US$855,000) only. The snag is that I just discovered that I couldn't collect this money, directly, from these companies in my name or the name of any of my family members, because government will investigate ""why?"" and ""what for? Therefore, to forestall any such problems, I decided to contact you through this secured and private medium, to solicit your assistance in this regard.

 

You will receive this money on my behalf, and use it as you would be further directed. That way, there will be no link between the companies and me. I will instruct the concerned companies to make the money available to you on installment either via swift means or by cheque as you so desire of not more than $75,000, as the case may be.

 

>From the money you receive on my behalf, you would be entitled to retaining 10% of the sum while you would be required to wire the balance 90% for its purpose of humanitarian services as would be advised. For example, if you receive $75,000, you would be required to retain 10% ($7,500) while you wire the balance $67,500 for its purpose. This is basically on trust. It is a simple job you do for me and all expenses for the cost of transfer of funds would be from the 90% and you will not spend a single cent from your money to actualize this project. No financial commitment from you and it's simple and risk free. You receive the money on my behalf, take away your 10% and redirect the remaining 90% as would be instructed. I can assure you that if you keep to our agreement, this will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship between the two of us. Afterward, there are a lot of other things we can do together that will fetch you a fortune.

 

If you are interested and would like to work with me for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS, I would need you to provide me with the following:

 

(1) IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY SWIFT MEANS:

Provide me with:

a). Name of your bank.

b) Address of your bank.

c) Bank Telephone and Fax.

d) Account Number.

e) Swift Code/Routing Number.

d)Account Names.

 

(2).OTHERWISE, IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY CHECK:

 

Then, you do not have to provide your banking information. Simply provide me with:

a) Your full names (As would be on the check).

b) Contact/Mailing address

c) Your Telephone and Fax Number.

 

Furthermore, as surety for the money that would be paid to you on my behalf, I would need a scanned copy of your International Passport or Drivers License for record purpose.

 

When I receive all the aforementioned, I will then send a working AGREEMENT between you and I, to guide and guard this relationship.

 

Once all these are sorted out, I will notify the first company of my desire to receive my money through you and instruct them accordingly.

 

In conclusion:

 

I wish to draw your attention to the wise observation of Marlene Gill, who wrote:

 

""To exist is to change,

To change is to mature,

To mature is to go on creating one's self endlessly,""

 

As we continue to change and to mature as individuals and as a nation, let us continue to dream that one-day, very soon, Cholera and HIV/AIDS will no longer devastate our nation, that all of our young people will resort to responsible behavior and that the moral values of our forebears will once more dominate our society.

 

LET US DARE TO DREAM. For it is not an impossible dream.

 

This is simply from my heart to you.

 

I wish you the very best while giving my thanks in anticipation of a lasting business relationship with you.

 

Kindly send the requirements as mentioned above via my private email addresses as stated.

 

My regards,

 

K. M. ZONDI (REV),

Deputy Minister of Public Works,

Central Government Building,

6th Floor, Room 623,

Mr Roberts <davroberts@barclays.co.uk>,R@M,"Fri, 03 Sep 2004 11:46:39 +0100",,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I beg you to carefully go through this email and should it not meet 
your business or personal ethics, please accept my apologies in advance.
My name is David Roberts, the Chief Executive of Private Clients &
International of the Barclays Group with head office at 54 Lombard 
street, London EC3P 3AH. 

I am writing this letter to solicit for your support 
and assistance to carry out a project concerning a late customer of the 
bank by name Dr. Victor Morgan, an oil magnet and philanthropist who died on 
the 14th of June 2002 in the London Hospital after being involved in fatal 
car crash which also claimed the life of his wife and two sons.

Lying in his inactive account in one of our branches is the sum of 
Thirty Million United States Dollars. Ever since he died the bank has placed a 
stop on all transactions on this account pending when his next of kin would 
come forward for necessary actions, identification and collection. 
Unfortunately from our investigations and confirmations from his attorney he has no 
family members who are aware of the existence of the money and as such, we 
have decided to do business with you.

If you stand in as the beneficiary of this funds the money will be 
released to you, after the due processes have being followed.

Obviously we do not want this money to go into the Bank Treasury 
because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such fund remains 
unclaimed for 3 years, the money will be transferred into the Bank Treasury as 
unclaimed debt. This would not take too much time to get done as his lawyer 
already has the necessary Letters of Administration and court orders from the
British high court which are part of the documents required by the 
Barclays bank to process fund release approvals.

To do this work 75% of the money will be for our end, 20% will be for 
you while 5% will be for any xpenses incurred during the transaction. 
Please reach me at my private email address above, if willing to do business 
with us.

Thanks and regards,

David Roberts.

xiao gang <xg2004@ofir.dk>,,"Sat, 24 Jul 2004 01:48:36 +0200",GOODDAY TO YOU!!!,"FROM THE DESK OF:
MR XIAO GANG,
BANK OF OVERSEAS CHINESE
TAIPEI,TAIWAN


Dear Friend,

How are you today and business in your country? I am Mr.Xiao Gang, Bank 
Manager,Bank Of Overseas Chinese North Shyn Lin District, Taipei, Taiwan. I 
would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail 
confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a 
result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no 
one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with 
certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. I know you would be 
wondering why I am writing you with a request such as this but I only urge you 
to read on.

In November 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid 
Minerals Corporation, Mr. Mark Kogan, made a Fixed Deposit  of the sum of 
US$10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars) which accumulated  to the 
sum of US$20,160,176.00 (Twenty Million, One hundred and sixty thousand, One 
hundred and seventy six United States Dollars for twelve calendar months in my 
branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
in America and Britain but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and 
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals 
Corporation that Mr.Mark Kogan died alongside his wife, from an airplane 
crash. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving 
next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his 
estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize 
our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from 
conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the 
field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of 
its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers 
and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to 
depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, 
ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they 
nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next 
of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; Mr. 
Mark Kogan died interstate. In line with our internal processes for account 
holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good 
faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This 
investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every 
continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the 
root of the problem. This sum of US$20,160,176.00 has since been sitting in my 
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end 
of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.

According to the Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five) 
years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if 
nobody applies to claim the funds. What I wish to relate to you will smack of 
unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an 
outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking 
world aberrational. The world of banking especially is fraught with huge 
rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. 
You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I 
propose. There is US$20,160,176.00 deposited in my bank, I alone have the 
deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of 
relationship with the deceased, which I shall provide you with, is presented. 
I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as Bank of overseas 
chinese is concerned, the bank's management has no single idea of whats the 
history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to 
release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. 
This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this mans family; 
they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation 
has come to an end. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a 
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. mark kogan so that the fruits 
of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt 
government officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple, all you have 
to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can 
prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as 
the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and 
notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary authentication, approval 
and a letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer to be 
done. A bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with 
will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next 
of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share 90/10.

I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no 
interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do 
not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete 
this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because 
you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like 
myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole 
private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find 
against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the 
dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities 
only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, 
for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and i 
wont let it pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will 
not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not 
destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family 
with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task 
well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have 
here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. There is no 
risk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the 
attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantee the successful 
execution of this transaction. If you are interested in this lucrative role, I 
urge you to indicate to that effect. Upon your response, if favourable, I 
shall then provide you with more details and relevant information that will 
help you get full understanding of the transaction. I will appreciate it if 
you send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easier 
communication.

If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this email

SHANGHAI COMMERCIAL BANK LIMITED,UK BRANCH
65 CORNHILL LONDON EC3V 3NP,UNITED KINGDOM.

Greetings,

I would not have used this medium (Internet) but I choose to reach you
through it because it is the fastest,surest and most secured medium of
communication. However,this correspondence is un-official and private,and
it should be treated as such. I also guarantee you that this transaction
is risk free from all what you may think of.

I am Mr.Fan Jen-Liang,an account officer with SHANGHAI COMMERCIAL BANK
LIMITED (London Branch), I am contacting you based on trust and
confidentiality that will be attached to this transaction.The Management
and the Legal department of our BANK (SHANGHAI COMMERCIAL BANK LIMITED UK)
in a recent meeting,recommended that the account of one of my late
customer and branch depositor MR. YUGUANG ZHENG,should be declared
dormant,confisticated and the depositor's fund sent to the Bank Treasury
according to UK Banking and financial law.
The depositor,YUGUANG ZHENG died in world trade centre and was one of the
victims of the september 11,2001 incident that befall the United State of
America,ever since his death the bank has made series of efforts to
contact any of the relatives to claim this money but without success, you
can confirm through this site:
http://www.september11victims.com/september11Victims/victims_list.htm

MR.YUGUANG ZHENG is an account holder in my branch, he owns a dollar
account with the sum of US$8.3M (Eight Million,three Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars Only) deposited in a Secret account with my branch
.In fact, since his death in 2001, no next of kin of the Dollar account
holder nor any his relative  has shown up to claim his money this is
because he has the account as a secret account and he left all the
documents for the deposit with me.

Having waited since 2001,I am now fully convinced that no one would turn
up to claim his money before the bank stipulated collection deadline and
this is where I am interested and why I want to present you now to my bank
as the relation of the deceased,I will use my position here in the bank
and I will give you the relevant documents and contacts to file in the
claim application and then effect the approvals for  the transfer of the
money to your nominated bank account, I will be the one to provide the
vital documents for the claims of the money and then advise you  exactly
how we should handle it.

Please include your telephone/fax number/ Home Address when replying this
mail and I will give you more information as soon as you indicate your
willingness to assist in this transaction.
I will use my position to get all internal documentations to back up the
claims.Do not be bothered that you are not related in any way to him as I
am in position to afix your name as the next of kin.
The whole Procedures will last only 7 working days to get the fund
retrieved successfully without trace even in future. After the transfer of
the money we shall share the money 60-40,that is I  will have 60% while
you will have 40%.

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.


Attention Please,


I am Dr Hassan Dantata, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting 
section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West 
Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a 
business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end 
of the transaction .


During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank 
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this development.


The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United 
States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive 
information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement 
to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get 
the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been 
put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as 
soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also 
benefit your self to this great business opportunity.


In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from 
to your own designation bank account.


I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and 
internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have 
been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.


I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when 
I hear from you.


I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,


Yours faithfully,


Dr Hassan Dantata

Dear

With due honor and respect, I introduce myself to you for a better 
relationship. I am Mr,TONY SMITH  the Director in charge of Audit/Accounts 
unit, Foreign Remittance Department of AMLGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH 
AFRICA(ABSA). Your contact is courtesy of Business online network via 
Internet as I decided to contact you for this beneficial transaction that is 
  100% risk free.

During auditing, verifications/investigations in our bank at the end of last 
fiscal (financial) year, I discovered the sum of (US$17.5M}SEVENTEEN MILLION 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS in a dormant account belonging 
to an  Australian international businessman who died along with his family 
in the November 5th,2001 plane crash in Abidjan west Africa. Our 
investigations revealed no survival or NEXT OF KIN/RELATIONS for claims as 
we have long been expecting someone to forward applications for claims as it 
applies to our banking  regulations. Information / verifications from 
reliable sources confirmed that his supposed ?NEXT OF KINS? died with him in 
the crash. Hence this for your perusals.

However, I kept this information (SECRET) confidential within my 
jurisdiction to enable us submit claims and transfer this fund through 
trustworthy person whom we shall present to our bank as the BONAFIDE ?NEXT 
OF KIN? to the deceased. We intend to credit this fund into any of your 
nominated (designated) offshore bank account for investments.Meanwhile, all 
domestic arrangements for claims has been put in place awaiting your 
acceptance to participate. I will give you directives and all needed  
information as soon as I receive your positive response.

Kindly understand that we could not carry out this on our own as based on 
the simple facts that we are civil servants and secluded from operating 
foreign account and too, it will raise eyebrows on our side in terms of 
transfer being staff of the bank. Moreover, this fund belongs to a foreigner 
and demands same as next of kin to claim it. Hence your contact for   
successful operation. My colleagues and I has resolved to offering you 20% 
of the, total sum as commission, We will invest 75% of our share in your 
country provided it is profit oriented. 5% of the total fund will be set 
aside to re-emburse all expenses to be incurred in the course of  running 
this transaction such as telephone and other minor expenses. I am  assuring  
you of a smooth and successful transaction provided you display maturity and 
observe confidentiality.

And it will interest you to know that the Reserve Bank(Apex) will approve 
credit of this fund into your account as contract payment to abstain you 
from all queries regarding the source (originality) of this fund and will 
provide you (beneficiary) with contractual (data) details to certify your 
bank or  government if the need arises. Therefore, be kind to clarify
the following for my consideration:

1. Can your account accommodate this fund in your local bank without 
government intervention or do you have an account outside your country where 
you may consider safe for this fund ?.
2. What are taxation in your country like as I desire a low/free tax zone?.
3. What are the interest rates on long/short term fixed deposit in your 
local banks?.
4. What other lucrative investments would you suggest as I intend banking, 
real estate and hotels if they are good business venture in your Country?.
5. Can you be able to make residential documents and purchase a house for me 
and my family to relocate and settle in your country?.

Kindly indicate your private telephone and fax number for more  effeicient 
communication.
Looking forward to your anticipated urgent response.

Best regards,

(MR TONY SMITH)

Mr.Philip Jones <philjones1@uboot.com>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Tue, 24 Jun 2003 23:12:46 +0100",please reply,"From:Mr.Philip Jones. 
(Executive Manager) 
Private Tel/Fax: 234-1-7598296 
Private E-mail: philjones1@uboot.com 

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr. Philip jones, an official with one of the APEX 
banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent 
and very confidential 
business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an 
American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with 
us and his present balance is valued at 
US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We 
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After a month, we 
sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his 
employers that he died from an automobile accident. On 
further investigation, we found out from his account 
file that he never made a will and all attempts to 
trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. 
We therefore made further investigations and 
discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any 
next of kin or relations in all his official documents 
in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still 
lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest 
is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it 
is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this 
money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration 
of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Government if unclaimed. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you 
to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. 
This is simple; all we need is some of your details so 
that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. 
Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services 
of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and 
notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary 
documents and letters of probate/administration in 
your favour for the transfer. The money would be 
shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. 

There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this 
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my 
position as a manager guarantees the successful 
execution of this transaction. If you are interested, 
please reply immediately via email. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest 
assured that this transaction would be most profitable 
for us. I shall still require your assistance to 
invest my own share in your country just incase you 
can help, otherwise we'll take our share . 

Awaiting your urgent reply, 

Mr.Philip Jones.

Dear Sir, 

Dearest Valued Friend,
It is with deep sense of honor and respect that I humbly make this appeal to you with the understanding that any fact/s or opinion/s expressed in this letter are given in confidence and solely for your personal information and use. If it does not interest you, discard the mail but if it makes sense to you, I open my arms wide to do business with you.

I take liberty anchored on strong desire to solicit for your assistance on this mutual beneficiary and risk free transaction with you, which I hope you give urgent attention. To be precise;

Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds. 

The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). 

We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or yourself.  

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. 

The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. 

This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance of this proposal. Please send all correspondence to and response to potobo3@netscape.net

Engr Paul O. Otobo.

Ahmed Ali <ahmed_al_benin@yahoo.co.uk>,,"Tue, 29 Nov 2005 06:01:50 -0600",Business Proposal.,"


Good day to you.

I am Ahmed Ali the director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section
of Bank of Africa Benin in West Africa,and also a special account officer
of  Mr. Abel Faiza Bahar, a  Lebanese.He was a Seasoned Contractor with
Benin Cement Company in Benin Republic., who unfortunately died in the
plane crash of Union Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727  in Cotonou,
Benin republic on the december 26,2003.

You will read more stories about the crash on visiting this website:
www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/

Before his death on the 26th December 2003, Mr. Abel Faiza Bahar has a
fixed deposit account with the bank and no other person knows about this
account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me that his supposed next of kin died along
with him in the crash. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate
any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to  contact you. I
contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client
before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank.

Consequently, Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives 
for over 5 weeks now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of
kin  of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at
US$10.8 million can be paid to you and then you and me can share the
money. 80% to me and 20% to you.I have all necessary legal documents that
can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest
co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from
any breach of the law. All documents of transaction will be destroyed
immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.

If this proposal is acceptable to you, kindly email your following
information to me:

a.Complete names
b.Private telephone number
c.Private fax number
d.Private email

Until you write,have a nice day and God bless. You can also contact me via

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Mr. Kazeem Hatch who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $12.6Million (Twelve Million six hundred thousand US Dollars) with one Finance/ Security Company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the way am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use these fund to fund churches, orphanages, Research centers and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
 
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where i am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the lord, Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply on email: judithhatch@dcemail.com  I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company.

I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian individual for this aim purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated therein. Hoping to hearing from you. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,

Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Tambo

I believe you are a busy person, please let me briefly
outline Our agenda, and then, I will proceed to give you
details.
I am Mrs. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha the Only Wife of present
Governor of Bayelsa State of Republic of Nigeria I know
that it may surprise you being emailed by a strange Woman
from African country asking for urgent assistance in an
urgent deal. The reason why I decided to involve you in
this deal is due to what my husband is  experiencing in
London at present, when he was arrested with 1 .5 millioin
pound sterling in his guest house in london recently.
CHECK THESE LINK OUT;
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4253362.stm
 http://www.nigeriaworld.com
Because of this terrible experience I decided that morning
about the money (USD$120Millions) left behind here in state
house,I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, because
I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money.
I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited the
consignments with a security/courier company. I did not
want the management of the Security Company to know the
content of the consignments, therefore I registered the
content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security
company believes that  what I deposited with them was Gold
Bars.
I have notified the Security Company where I deposited the
consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the
consignment abroad and the security company has since been
waiting for my authority for the consignment to leave my
country and move to abroad.
 If you know that you handle .receive such big funds
honestly and wisely , then do contact me back first through
this my email:  Mrs.DiepreyeAlamieyeseigha@hotmail.com
We have set assude 20% percentage of the cash will be
your's after you receive the consignment/funds. Then you
will open an account in your country with my name and
deposit our 80% percentage of the cash.I want to inform you
that if you are able to receive this money your percentage
will increase after subsequent deals if you prove your
reliability in this deal Please don't involve a third party
in this deal because of the nature of the deal and also as
a public figure my husband may be implicated by the third
person And don't dispose any document of this deal to any
body except when we ask you to do so, Note that this
transaction involves no risk whatsoever for you will have
NO dealing with my country Nigeria goverment Rather, you
will deal directly with the security courier company . 
 Let me have your confidential Details YOUR FULL
NAME,PHYSICAL MAILING ADDRESS,PHONE AND FAX NUMBER (Which i
will give to the company to ship the consignment to you
immediately) in your response to this proposal   .
This matter should be treated as urgent and confidential as
possible please
Best regards

Liu Yan <liuyans_office@yahoo.com.hk>,,"Thu, 15 Mar 2007 21:45:31 -0500","""work with me""","Hallo friend,

This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before  
neither in person nor by correspondence, but I believe that it takes  
just one day to meet or know someone either physically or through  
correspondence.
I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as  
being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, and one has no doubt  
in your ability to handle a financial business transaction. I am Mr.  
Liu Yan a transfer supervisor operations in investment section in Bank  
of China Ltd. Secretariat of the BOCHK Charitable Foundation 13/F.  
Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road, Hong Kong I have an obscured  
business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client  
General Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also  
business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months,  
with a value of Nineteen million Five Hundred Thousand United States  
Dollars only in my branch.

Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war.  
Again after the war another notification was sent and still no  
response came from him. We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim  
Ali and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that  
hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that  
General Mohammed Jassim Ali did not declare any next of kin in his  
official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he  
also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one  
except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million Five  
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and  
no one will ever come forward to claim it.

What bothers me most is that, according to the to the laws of my  
country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the  
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the  
funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like  
you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed  
Jassim Ali so that you will be able to receive his funds.I want you to  
know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out  
successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the  
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to General  
Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is required from you at this stage is  
for you to provide me with your Full Names, private phone number and  
Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been  
made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on  
your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in  
your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be  
provided by you with my guidiance.There is no risk involved at all in  
the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney  
will prepare all the necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning  
this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated  
bank account we shall discuss the percentage issue on your reply.If  
you are interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax  
and current residential address, and I will prefer you to reach me on  
my private and secure email address below (liuyan_1968@yahoo.com.hk)  
and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this  
operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
N:B Please make sure you contact me on my private email

STEPHEN AYLING <aylingstephen@virgilio.it>,,"Thu, 22 Dec 2005 23:42:45 +0100",PROPOSITION,"


Hello,

I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense 
benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that 
we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when 
we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am 
presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his 
next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died 
on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with 
other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below 
which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.

 WEBSITE.
http://news.bbc.co.
uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.
 
I am now faced with confusion of 
who to pass the fortune to.
According to the English law, the fortune 
is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward 
as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor 
of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the 
beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, 
which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I 
alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.

Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for 
you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the 
tsunami victims,
as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is 
amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the 
$7million legacy.

Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider 
this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are 
documents to back it up. 
This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-
kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I 
prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being 
disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the 
English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this 
issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I 
therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if 
you decline my request.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours truly

Stephen Ayling.

I am Mrs Mariam Afonso I was married to Mr. Moses Afonso
who was a contractor with the government of Cote D'Ivoire before he died in the year 2002 after few days in the hospital. The doctor said his death was as a result of poison.

We were married for so many years without a child.Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $25 Million usa dollars with a security company here in Cote D lvoire Presently this money is still in the custody of the security company in Cote D lvoire. 

Recently, my Doctor told me that it is very likely i will die within the next nine months due to cancer problem.Having known my condition I decided to donate
this fund to a church,organization or good person that will utilize  this money the way I am going to instruct herein.

I want a church,organization or good person that will use this fund for orphanages, widows and other people that need help and also propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that""Blessed is the hand that giveth"". l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband's property and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death.

I don't want them to know about this development and l know that With God all things are possible This is why I am taking this decision.Though it was very painful to hear this kind of news from my doctor but I am notafraid of death because I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. I don't think there is need for any telephone communication in this regard because of my health but the important thing to me is for you to do what i will require you in this regard.


As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security company here in Cote d' lvoire. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the Security company  that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money.Note when you will contact the security company on no account should you let them know that the content of the deposit is money because my late husband decleared it to them as containg family values belonging to his foriegn business partner who will come for the withdrawal and termination of the contract with the certificate of the deposit which was issued to my late husband by the security company on the day he made the deposit with them which i will send to you on your confirmation that you can handle this transaction.

I also want you,church or the organization to always pray for me because the lord is my only shepherd.My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spiritand Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any
delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good person, church,organization for this same purpose.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your response immedaitely through my private email account(mariamafo@netscape.net).

Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.
l remain yours sister in Christ.

Respectfully submitted, 

My name is Mohammed Bello, the Assistant Manager, credit and foreign bills of UNION BANK PLC. I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you to carry out this business opportunity in my department. Lying in an inactive account awaiting liquidation is the sum of us$5million belonging to a foreign customer(Mr. Bernard Scott)with account number 14-2552004 who happens to be deceased. He died with his wife and two children in a plane crash on board the EAS BAC 111-500 flight which crashed at the recent Lagos/kano plane crash at Kano Nigeria. 

I got your e-mail address through an internet marketing firm while searching for a reliable and reputable person to handle this transaction.

Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come and claim these fund, the NDIC could not liquidate the account because I have filled a motion that a next of kin wrote in to the effect. To this effect, they can not release the money unless someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline. 

Unfortunately he has no family member in Nigeria or Europe who are aware of the existence of the money (as he was a contractor with the federal Republic of Nigeria). 

At this juncture I have decided to do business with you in collaboration with officials that matter in the bank, to this effect I solicit your assistance in applying as the next of kin then the money will be released to you. As I do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. The banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed for a period of time up to seven years (7yrs) the money will be transferred into the banks treasury as an unclaimed bill. Our request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Ben noise cannot stand as next of kin. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed, you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the decease, and then we will follow up all formalities for the transaction. 

Note that this transaction is legal safe and 100% risk free and all modalities has been worked out for a successful transaction and all legal formalities have also been perfected. In view of this, You will be entitle for 30% of the total. 


Upon receipt of your reply which should be sent to mohbell@mail2world.com  for confidential reason, I will send to you by fax or mail the text of the application Form, as soon as you receive the text I will further clarify you in other issues as to affect the business. 
Await to hear from you. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Mr. Mohammed Bello.

A prosperous New Year to you and your wonderful family.

Excuse my communication through email, on an issue as important as this
one. We shall definitely open up a more confidential form of
communication as soon as I receive a positive response from you.

I write to inform you of my desire to purchase and import Machinery in
your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance
Allocations of the federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria.
We have made the necessary enquiries, and we have been informed that the
Machinery are available and can be obtained in your country. Hence our
desire to have an overseas agent is very important. I have therefore
been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our oversea agent
in order to actualize this transaction. 

It may interest you to know that our government, having realised that Crude oil is not the only source of income for the country, has began serious programes in the areas mentioned above. This is why we are taking advantage of the situation to establish an out fit, that would handlke such matters. This way, we can either sell, lease or even execute contracts for individuals, organizations or the government.

The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out
our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account
at the Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria), we intend
to transfer the funds to your country in a convenient bank account that
will be provided by you before we can put the funds into your account in
your country you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the
Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria. The contract sum
comes to a total of US$31 Million. We have agreed to give you 30% of the
funds for your participation. As soon as payment is effected, and the
amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we
intend to use our own share in acquiring some Construction and Oil
drilling equipment, Farm Machinery and Marine Equipments abroad. For
this you shall also serve as our agent. 

In the light of this, I would like you to forward to me, your detail
particulars such asy our company name and address,your personal fax and
telephone numbers for easy communication.

You are requested to communicate your acceptance of this proposal
through my above stated email address or cole3@irangate.net after which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. Your prompt
response will be highly appreciated. As soon as I receive a positive
response from you, a comprehensive agency agreement would immediately be
prepared and I shall send a form of identification. This would enable
know with whom you are dealing.

Thank you in anticipation of your cooperation.

FROM MR HASSAN DIOUF <hassan_diouf@yahoo.com>,,"Thu, 15 Dec 2005 21:53:50 +0100",GOOD DAY," 


 

 






 

Greeting,
Sir,
I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in you, for me to have contacted you even though we've not met before.
My name is Hassan diouf,the only son of late Mr.Mohammed Diouf who was the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries plc.SCAFECAO)""Bouake"" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
You can find the story on this website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm
On 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.
After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.
That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 30%of the total amount for your assistance .
Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce you to the Bank where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer. So you can contact me through my alternate email adress for security reason.
Email hassan_diouf@walla.com am waiting for your response.
Thanks and God bless.
Hassan Diouf .
For the Family's

ACCESS BANK NIGERIA PLC
Dear Friend,
I am MR Olu Adesina, the bill and exchange manager of Access Bank nigeria
pLC, with due respect and 
regards,i have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will
be 
very 
beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. We had a 
foreign 
client MR BRAIN O. ISAAC ,who deposited a huge sum of money (US$27.5 
million)with our
bank.
Eventually, this client was among the victims of a plane crash that 
crashed on 
the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A but, since then we have not had any body coming

for 
the claims as the next of kin. A situation I have monitored closely 
with my 
position in the bank.
Now, having monitored this deposit over the years after his death, and 
hence 
nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past three and half 
years, I 
have moved the file to my private volt.
A friend of mine in your country gave me your contact when i disclosed to
him that i need a foreign partner that will be trusted for a business,but
i did not tell him the kind of deal that i want to go into with you,so this
information should only be for you please.
I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as 
every 
other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a

foreigner to enable me move the fund to his account. This does not have

any 
risk attached to it as all the internal documentations will be 
handled by me.
I therefore request you to confirm your interest by repling this 
message,and I 
will furnish you with details. For assisting me,you will be entitled with
30% of the whole sum,while 65% will be for me,then the remaining 5% will
cover any expences that may occure in this deal.When the deal is completed,i
will now join you in your country so that you will further assist me to
invest the money in your country as i do not know much about investment.
I look forward to hearing from you.If you are interested,please send your
address,your full names and your phone and fax numbers to my private email
address at oluoluaa@yahoo.com so that we will commeeeence with the plans
immediately.
Remain Bless.
Yours Faithfully.

Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, I am former Mrs. Fatima Adijat Alade, now Mrs.
Mary Abosede Alade, a widow to Late Sherrif Alade. I
am 70years old. I am now a new Christian
convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast.


>From all indications, my condition is serious and is
quite obvious that I may not live more than six
months,because the cancer stage has gotten to a very
severe state and my doctor has told me this. My late
husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the
period of our marriage we had a son who was also
killed in cold blood during the Gulf war. 


My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I
inherited all his business and wealth. As my doctor
told me that I may not live for more than six months,I
am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide
part of the inherited wealth, by contributing to the
development of evangelism in part of the world. 
This mission which will no doubt be tasking had made
me to recently relocated to Nigeria, Africa where I
live presently. I selected your ministry after
visiting the website for this purpose and prayed over
it, I am willing to donate the sum of
US$10.000,000.00(Ten Million USD)to your Ministry for
the development of evangelism and also as aids for the
less privileged around you. 


Please note that, this fund is lying with a Security
Company and my family lawyer will file an immediate
application for the transfer of the money in the name
of your ministry. 


If you are interested,do contact our Lawyer on the email address below,his name is Barrister FRANK OSAROBO:


email: frankosarobo@email.ro


Please, do not reply me if you have
the intention of using this fund for personal use.


Lastly, I want your ministry to keep praying for me as
regarding my health because I have come to find out
since my spiritual birth recently that wealth
acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is
vanity upon vanity. If you have to die says the
Lord,keep fit and I will give you the crown of life. 


May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of
God, and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be
with you now and forevermore.


We await your urgent reply. 


Yours in Christ,

ATTN SIR:

I got your contact from the International Economic /
Business Directory in Cote d'Ivoire. I consider your
company extremely capable in handling this mutual
business transaction I wish to undertake with you. As
a result of my zeal towards foreign investment and
also security for my life and possession, I therefore
wish to give an insight of my purpose of contacting
you.

I was the personal confidant to the ousted military
head of state of Sierra Leone (MAJOR JOHNNY KOROMAH).
However, when the ECOMOG peace keeping force struck,
his excellence was forced to run into Liberia on exile
while some of his aides left for some other
neighbouring countries.

While these events took place, I decided to move to
C��te d?Ivoire with my family and a total sum of 
thirty million US dollars (US$30,000,000) which was
the part of cash under my control within the
presidential mansion when I was in change of
securities. On getting to Abidjan, I immediately
deposited the fund in a bank in Abidjan the economic capital of Cote
D'Ivoire.

Consequently, I sincerely implore you as a partner to
arrange an avenue which this money could be
transferred to you for investment purposes and in
order to actualise this investment proposal. You are
implored to assist in the following.

1)You are required to provide a safe foreign bank
accounts into which the money could be transferred.
2)You shall serve as a general overseer and guardian
of this fund and all the investments thereafter.
3)And you shall benefit 20% of the total sum for your
efforts and absolute assistance in ensuring that this
fund is successfully transferred into your accounts
and as well as 5% of every monthly profit out of all
investments.

Having stated the above clearly, I expect your soonest
response through this mail number kampala09@zwallet.com
Please also endeavour to treat this business
transaction as highly confidential.

Yours truly,

L.T. J.N. KAMPALA

          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

Dear Friend,
I am Mr. T. Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping.
No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.
The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)
Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication.
Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )
Thanks and regards.

           (URGENT AND CONFIDENTAIL BUSINESS)

Dear sir, 

We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundred
and Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$
142,000,000.00) from South Africa. 

I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and
honest person who will be capable and fit to provide
either an existing bank account or to set up a new
bank account immediately to receive this money,though
an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long
as you will remain honest to me till the end of this
important business trusting in you and believing in
God that you will never let me down either now or in
time to come. 

I am Dr. Tony Devon the external auditor of a
Bank.During the course of our auditing,I discovered a
floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1995
and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account
again.After going through some old files in the
records, I discovered that the owner of the account
died without a ""Heir apparent to the throne"" hence the
money is floating and if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. 

The owner of this account is  a foreigner and an
industrialist died, since 1995,until now no other
person(s) knows about this account or could give any
documentary evidence concerning this account. As such
this account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that until his
death was the manager Oriental Diamond Company,in
South Africa. 

However, if you are interested in this business we
will start the first money transfer with Forty Two
Million U.S.Dollars(U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon
successful transaction without any disappointment from
you. We shall also re-apply for the payment of the
remaining amount to your account. 

While the total amount involved is One hundred and
Forty Two Million United States Dollars
(U.S.$142,000,000.00)only. I would want us to make a
first transfer of [Forty Two Million United States
Dollar.(U.S.$42,000,000.00)from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am only
contacting you as a foreigner because this money can
not be approved to a local account, without valid
international foreign ""Agreement"", but could only be
approved to any foreigner with valid international
credentials: passport or drivers license and foreign
account because this sum is in U.S. dollars and the
former owner of the account is a foreigner too, thus
the money
could only be approved into a foreign account. 

However, knowing all this, we will reach a binding
agreement in this regards.As a matter of urgency,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of $12.500.000 (twelve million and five hundred thousand dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve.
I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by  President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and properties then decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt,and the farmlands and machines seized; yet the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 25% share for possible help on investing in any rentable sector.
thanks for your anticipated assistance. if you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A  quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for further details will be highly appreciated.

sankara usman <sankara_usman021@hotmail.com>,,"Mon, 05 Mar 2007 17:54:35 +0000",Your kind attention needed.,"Hello Dear,

This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as 
unserious could come into your mind but please consider it a divine wish and 
accept it with a deep sense of humility.

I am Mr. Usman Sankara, the manager in charge of Auditing  department of 
Bank of Africa (B.O.A)Ouagadougou Burkina Faso in West Africa, with due 
respect and Regard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction 
that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this Bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customer 
who died on July 30th 2002 of a ghastly motor accident and the fund has been 
dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the fund in our 
Custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this 
development. Although personally,

I keep this information secret to enable the whole plans and idea be 
Profitable and successful during the time of execution, the said amount is 
Fifteen million three hundred thousand United States dollars(US$15.3m), as 
it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information on my search 
for a reliable partner, I contacted you to be my partner and person to be 
reliable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any 
problem.

Meanwhile all the arrangement to put claim over this fund as the next of kin 
to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a 
foreign account has been put in Place and directives and needed information 
will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness 
to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity, 
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant and we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who 
will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to 
the bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to 
be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification 
and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole 
money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free, on 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer, while 65% will be for 
me, please you have been advised to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in 
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with 
you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank Until you confirm 
the money in your account, and ask us to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further Investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in and all other necessary vital information will be send to you 
when I hear from you.

I suggest you get back to me As soon as possible and also include your 
personal phone/mobile and fax numbers for easy communication.

Yours faithfully,
Mr. Usman Sankara

Auditing department of
Bank of Africa (B.O.A)

Mr. Ateeq Rahman Khan <ateeqkhan11@maktoob.com>,R@M,"Mon, 12 Dec 2005 17:57:21 +0400",Swift Response...,"This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.  I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.
I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. 
After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser? family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. 
This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/ unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.
 With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. 
 I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
 If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. 
 I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent reply through my private email address: ateeq_khan001@yahoo.com

RE:   TRANSFER OF [$126,000.000.00 USD] 
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. 

Hello:

I am Dr. Bello Kabir the General Auditor of highly
Capitalized Banks in West Africa.

I want to Transfer some Money into your account. This Money totalling
the
sum of USD$126Million (One Hundred and Twenty Six Million Dollars), was
discovered when Auditing accounts in the Bank Of Commerce and Industry
also
known as the ""United Bank for Africa Plc (Gabon)"". It was during the
process that I got to discover this Money held in one of the accounts
with
the Bank. 

My interest on this particular account started when I saw that the
account have
remained dormant since 1998, as nobody has operated on it since then. 
My Investigation also revealed to me that the Money belonged to a
Foreigner 
in Gabon: Mr. Alex C. Powell who was the Original owner of the Money and 
who died in 1998 without writing a ""WILL"" therefore leaving nobody with 
any knowledge or trace of the Money.

This is therefore the reason why I have contacted you so that you will
act as 
the Beneficiary of the Money and receive it in your Bank account because
this money
can not be approved for Transfer to a local person here, without valid
international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and
foreign Bank account because the money is in US dollars and the former
owner of
the account Mr. Alex C. Powell is a foreigner too, and the money can
only be
approved into a foreign Bank account.

We will start the first transfer with Twenty six million [$26,000.000]
upon successful Transfer without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining USD$100Million to your
account. 

I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let
me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I
am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will

salim ibrahim <ibm@salimibrahim.net>,,"Fri, 29 Oct 2004 16:02:20 +0000",please help me,"Dear Friend,

My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been 
diagnosed with Esophageal cancer It has defiled all forms of medical 
treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according 
to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 
anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never 
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as 
that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know 
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money 
in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would 
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has 
called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my 
immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to 
give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last 
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity 
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has 
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute 
the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and 
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not 
trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left 
for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge

cash deposit of (Twenty million five hundred thousand u.s dollars)

that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help 
me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 15% for you,then 5% for any expenses insured.

God be with you.

SALIM IBRAHIM

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK -ADB ANNEX.
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.
IN WEST AFRICA.




PRIVATE CONFIDENTIAL NUMBER E-MAIL:dr_ ali_i1@hotmail.com

Dear Sir,



I am The Manager of Bill and Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department 
of African Development bank(ADB).  I am writing following the impressive 
information about you through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm 
in my country. He assured me of your capability and reliability to champion 
this businees opportunity.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 30m US dollars ( Thirty 
million US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his entire family in november 2001 in a plane 
crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin   or relation died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this 
discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make 
this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of 
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after six years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account,  10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my 
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for 
disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in 
the money will be remitted .

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction  is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of 
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,

DR ALI IBRAHIM.
Bill and Exchange Manager,
African Development Bank ADB .

fund out of the bank and to transfer it to your bank account in your

total sum and 5% for your expenses.can't yourself lucky my dear
friend, but remember that we must strike this deals by its rules as my
mother told me that i should negotiate with a reliable person that

nobody should cheat or have any bad plans against eachother.

if you don't have the capacity of bringing $10.5M into your account,
then you have to look for somebody who is capable, then you will
combine with him and meet me in Europe.

The transaction is only known by you, I and my old sick mother who is
presently in the hospital because she had heart-attack immediately she

I am NDIDI UWOMA the only son of late former Director of finance, CHIEF
BENARD UWOMA Sierra-Leone diamond and mining corporation.I must confess
my agitation is real, and my words is my bond, in this proposal. My late
father diverted this money meant for purchase of ammunition, for my country,
during the peak of disastrous civil war in my country, now he has deposited
the money with a Security Firm in one sealed box here in Abidjan, where
I am residing under political asylum with my younger sister PRECIOUS .

Now the war in my country is over with the help of ECOMOG soldiers, the
present government of Sierra Leone has revoked the passport of all officers
who served under the former regime and now ask countries to expel such person
at the same time freeze their account and confiscate their assets, it is
on this note that I am contacting you.

My main reason of contacting you to please come accept to take up the responsibilities
of my late father's business foreign parner in the Security Firm and claim
the box.Be informed that my late father deposited the box and registered
it as containing a Photographic Equipements belonging to his foreign partner
that is why it is note possible for us to make the claims ourselfs and he
did it as such to prevent them from knowing the box contains money so note
that it is only you and I knows that the content of the box is money and
please do not let the security firm know for security reasons.All I need
from you is to furnish me with your personal details

1) Your full name
2) Telephone/Fax number
3) Home address or office

These requirements are to be submitted to the Security Firm as my late father's
foreign business partner who will be coming for the claims of the box with
the key as I have contacted the Security Firm once where the deposit was
made by my late father and establish a relationship with them but the told
me in confident that the box will not be released to me nor any other person
unless my late father's foreign partner whom the deposit was made.

I am compensating you with 20% of the total amount. Now all my hope is banked
on you and I really want to invest this money in your country, were their
is stability of Government, political and economic welfare. Honestly I want
you to believe that this transaction is real and never a joke.

My late father CHIEF BENARD UWOMA gave me the photocopies of the certificate
of deposit issued to him by the Security Firm on the date of deposit, so
I can send you the copies for you to be clarified because, I do not expose
my self to anybody I see, I believe that you are able to keep this transaction
secret for me because this money is the hope of my life, it is important.

Please respond to me immediately after you must have gone through my message,
Feel free and make it urgent. Please try and negotiate for me some profitable
bluechip investment opportunities which is risky free which I can invest
with this money as soon as it 's confirmed in your position and a good university
where I and my sister will further our education as soon as we arrives to

Jose Martinez Guzman <josemartinezguzman@9y.com>,rrrrr <R@M>,"Thu, 10 Feb 2005 11:52:22 -0500",GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.,"Alternate email address: josemartinezguzman1940@yahoo.es 

Dear friend,


Greetings to you and your family! This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. 

My name is Jose Martinez Guzman. I am a 65 years old man, I am Cuban currently residing in Madrid (Spain). I was formerly living in Cuba and served under Castro`s government but had to run into self exile after the ruling Government of Fidel Castro closed in on my family on accusations of anti-government statements, I was once married with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly hands of Castro`s goons fell on them. 

l did made a lot of money serving Castro and on getting to Spain, I have been a merchant here in Madrid dealing in Ornamentals, Oriental Carpets and Artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about three(3) years ago when I was first diagnosed of Cancer of the Larynx.

Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for, I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family and hometown, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and some East European Countries. 

Before I became ill, I kept $US 5.5 Million in a long-term deposit vault of a bank and I didn`t state any next of kin when the money was deposited and if I died without stating any the money will automatically go into the coffers of the bank and I don`t want this to happen. I have left the hospital and presently receiving treatment in an acupuncture clinic, I have been undergoing treatment for Oesophageal Cancer at the hospital. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. 

It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations, because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations and the incident that happened in Asia too. 

Use your judgement to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. I am going to send you vital documents to back my claims and I am willing to offer you a reward If you are willing to help, please reply as soon as you can on my alternate email address: josemartinezguzman1940@yahoo.es 

Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.

Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko <drusmanibrahimtg08@hotmail.fr>,,"Tue, 18 Sep 2007 10:54:53 +0000",From Dr Usman Ibrahim / Mr Wahid Yoffe property.,"
FROM DR USMAN IBRAHIM DANKO.AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT.BANQUE TOGOLAISE POUR LE COMMERCE ET L'INDUSTRIE,LOME- TOGO. 
 
Dear Friend,             I do not intend to cause any grief to you. The reason for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human privileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned of the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing based on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assisting me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'Inustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard. 
 
I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horrific Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- century tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia. 
 
>From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed him with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The person that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who died along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was (US$11.4M). 
 
Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. 
 
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. 
 
May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer processing and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and my partner. 
 
Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. 
 
All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.
 Yours Sincerely, Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko.

MRS LOI C ESTRADA <mrrssjjjoseph@netscape.net>,R@E,"Sat, 10 Jan 2004 12:43:32 +0100",VERY URGENT,"Dear Friend, 
My name is LOI C.ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH
ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located
in the South East Asia. My husband was recently
impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass
demonstrators and the Senate. My husband is presently
in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption,
embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder
which might lead to death sentence.
The present government is forcing my husband out of
Manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. During
my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I
realized some reasonable amount of money from various
deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to
invest this money for my children's future on real
estate and industrial production.
My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do
it secretly for now. before my husband was impeached,
I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000
million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out
of Philippines and deposited the money with a security
firm that transports valuable goods and consignments
through diplomatic means.
I am contacting you because I want you to go to the
security company and claim the money on my behalf
since I have declared that the consignment belong to
my foreign business partner. You shall also be
required to assist me in investment in your country. I
hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not
sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me
properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of
the total money you will take for your assistance.
When I receive your positive response I will
let you know where the security company is and the
payment pin code to claim the money which is very
important.
For now, let all our communication is by e-mail
because my line are right now connected to the
Philippines Telecommunication Network services.
Please also send me your telephone and fax number.
I will ask my son contact you to give you more details
on after i have received a responce from you.through this
email address  mrssliocestrada@netscape.net

sanou bello <sanou_bello250@hotmail.com>,,"Wed, 22 Feb 2006 00:01:14 +0000",VERY VERY URGENT,"DR.SANOU BELLO
Dear,

I am the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Bank of Africa,
Ouagadougou . I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may 
be capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below;

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten 
million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 2000  
in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his 
supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim .

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines 
asociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
Unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .

We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me and my 
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for 
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as 
arranged,you must apply first to the bank as next of kin of the deceased 
customer. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the 
text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

I expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

Hoping to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,
DR .SANOU BELLO
Accounts & Audit Department ,
Bank of Africa

Nb.also give me your telephone and fax numbers for easy comunication with 
you.

Frank Michelle <frankmichelle4@franksite.org>,,"Tue, 13 Sep 2005 07:00:32 +0000",Urgent Attention.,"From:     Frank Michelle Esq.
          London, U.K.
          Telephone: +44 703 184 7859
          Fax line: +44 709 287 0887
          E-mail:barristertony@compaqnet.fr

I must apologise for berging into your mailbox without a formal introduction 
of myself to you. Actually, I got your mailbox in the web while trying to 
get a good and capable business person in your country for both business and 
investment purposes.Let me start by introducing myself; I am  Barrister 
Frank Michelle (Esq) I was the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Morris Thompson 
an American who was a private businessman in my country unfortunately lost 
his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on 
January 31st 2000, including his wife and only daughter.

You can read more about the crash on visiting these sites below,

1. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list

2. http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html

Before the plane crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a numbered fixed deposit 
for 18 calendar months with a value of US$ 2,500,000.00 (TWO MILLION, FIVE 
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS) in a bank here in U.K. Upon maturity 
several notice was sent to him, another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. I later found out that Mr. Morris Thompson and his 
family had been killed in that plane crash. After further investigation it 
was also discovered that Mr. Morris Thompson's  next of kin was his daughter 
who died with him in the crash.

What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the 
expiration of 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the U.K. 
GOVERNMENT, if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my 
suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the 
next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson so that you will be able to receive these 
funds for both of us.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:-

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall 
come out successfully. As a barrister, I will prepare the necessary document 
that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson.

PLEASE YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR FULL INFORMATION SUCH AS STATED BELOW,

[1] NAME:

[2] ADDRESS:

[3] AGE:

[4] SEX:

[5] TELEPHONE:

[6] FAX:

[7] OCCUPATION STATUS:

Also be informed that this Transaction will take us just 15 working days to 
accomplish beginning from when I receive your Data's.After you have been 
made the next of kin, I will also file an application to the bank on your 
behalf as soon as I secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in 
your favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided 
by you. This process is 100% risk free as I have set out all the modalities 
to see that a legalized method is used because then I will prepare all the 
necessary documents.

Please note that utmost secrecy and confidentiality is required at all times 
during this transaction. Once the funds have been transferred into your 
nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 45% for 
you and 5% set aside for any incidental expenses incurred during this 
transaction. If you are not interested, please delete this letter so that I 
can scout for another competent partner to conclude this transaction. Should 
you be interested please send me your full names, telephone, fax number and 
email address as stated above.  I will prefer that you reach me via this 
email address:- frankmichelle@compaqnet.fr

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Frank Michelle Esq.

ATTEN: 
      SEEKING FOR FINANCIAL INVESTMENT INFORMATION 
 
Zimbabwe formerly Rhodesia under the colonial rule gained independence in 1981 under the nationalist struggle for independence led by Mr. Robert Mugabe and late Joshua Nkomo. Under the white rule and since independence the minority whites that owned most of the farmlands in Zimbabwe have dominated agriculture. The aborigines believe that they are still slaves in their own land if they continue to work the lands for their whites masters even after independence. Robert Mugabe as the black Moses who led his people to freedom has vowed to revoke ownership of the white owned farms and redistribute the lands to the landless blacks. This move he said is necessary to redress the imbalance of the colonial era. For the struggle for freedom, to affect this initiative the government has amended its land acquisition laws and policies last few months, which gave about 3000 white Zimbabwean farmers a 45-day quit notice to leave their lands to the government. 
 
My family and I are caught up in this web of land politics, which also led to the death of our father. We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland, a neighbouring country, where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his government are playing Russian roulette over the Zimbabwean land crisis, every effort has begun in earnest to move our capital base to a stable country where it can be safer. 
 
With a capital base of US$25.5Million, there is a great deal of secrecy involved to avoid the piercing eyes and smelling noses of both the governments of Zimbabwe and South Africa. We are therefore contacting you so you can use a magnificent business technique to transfer this financial treasure out of South Africa. This money is presently deposited confidentially with A security Company here in South Africa. We mapped out 25% of the gross sum as due commission for your expected honest assistance in executing the successful transfer of this money out of South Africa, for our family investments.
 
Please, email us immediately if you are interested, so we can discuss further while we hold this correspondence in the strictest confidence. 
 
Thanks and God bless you. 
Yours truly, 
Evan Smith

DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED ON NOVEMBER  2001 IN A PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE MY DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT. 

ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY, I KEEP THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN MYSELF TO ENABLE THE WHOLE PLANS AND IDEA BE PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL DURING THE TIME OF EXECUTION. THE SAID AMOUNT WAS SUM OF $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3M)

MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND TRANSFER THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND DIRECTIVES AND NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST ME AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE BILLS, WHILE 65% WILL BE FOR ME.

Dear Friend ,

In a brief introduction, I am Peter Daniel, the Director of Operation  with     AFRICA DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB) of Benin-Cotonou ,Republic of Benin.I have a very interesting transaction to discuss with you. The business  underdiscussion has to do with one of our customer a national of your
country, who is a Consultant/ contractor with Societe Nationale Des  Products D' Agricole (SONAPRA) Company in Benin-Cotonou. I managed to get your  contact details through the Internet search  myself because time is of     importance to it and I am desperately looking for Someone to assist me to pull this money out from the bank before our   corrupt government
officials will confiscate the money.

On Thursday, December 25, 2003, this our customer , his wife and their  only daughter were involved in Air-Crash near the Atlantic Ocean in Cotonou  suburb. For more clarifications, you can visit the CNN web news for the  tragedy.
www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash

Since then I have made several inquiries to your Embassy, in a bid to locate any relation of this our customer. All attempts to reach the  next of  kin of our customer has been futile as He had no family here in Benin Republic.Hence my decision to contact you. I want you and I to go into
partnership, the nature of your business is completely irrelevant to this transaction as all I need from you is an assurance that my  interest will be fully protected once this transaction is concluded.

He made a numbered time (fixed) deposited for twelve calendar Months  and his account with our Bank accrues to about (Fourteen Million, Three  hundred and Fifty- Two Thousand US Dollars) $USD14.352M.

According to the Benin Law, at the expiration of (Three) years, the  money will revert to the ownership of the Benin government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to our customer so that the
fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt  government officials who will latter use the money to sponsor war in Africa and  kill innocent citizens in the search for political power/seat. Please note  that There will be no problem at all, my position as the Director of
Operation guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction within 7 Banking days and the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 40% for you and 60% for me.
This is very simple, I will like you to reply immediately so that I can send you the Text of application which you will fill and apply to the bank as the next of kin to our customer and I will use my good position in the bank as the Director of Operation to make sure that the application is approved,
during board meeting for immediate payment. If you are   interested, reply 
immediately via my private email address: peterdanielx4@hotmail.com

So that we can proceed at once. Please send to me also your private  phone,  or mobile numbers for easier correspondence.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

JONATHAN MOKOENA <davidmensoh@mail.com>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Thu, 16 Jan 2003 17:38:58 +0100",URGENT,"Attn: The President, 

Dear Sir, 

My mail may come to you as a surprise, but sincerely this is a 
proposal for a business deal that will benefit both of us. I am 
contacting you after a frantic search for a person who will be 
trustworthy and capable of handling a business of this dimension. 

My name is Mr. Jonathan Mokoena, the Under-Secretary in charge of 
Intergration at the Specialized Technical Committee of the African 
Union (AU), formerly Organization of Afriacn Unity (OAU). You may be 
aware of the transformation of the OAU to AU, and the mandate to 
build a new united Africa modelled on the pattern of European Union 
(EU). For this therefore, the various African leaders recently 
inaugurated the New Patnership for African Development (NEPAD). NEPAD 
is to streamline Africa towards achieving a common market, defence 
force, currency, foreign policy, judiciary etc. For the above, the 
various African countries have made whosoever contributions in 
hundreds of million dollars. We have equally received grants/aids 
from the EU, USA and other international governments and agencies. 
These moneies in all have ran into millions of dollars. 


As the officer in charge of receiving and managing these funds and 
executing the projects for which they are ment for, I have received 
all the money expected. I have also prepared my account which I have 
submitted to the AU High Command, and it has been approved by the AU 
Secratary-General, Dr. Amara Essy. However, in some of the money 
received, some of the donor countries and international bodies 
remitted to us amounts in excess of what they pledged. The AU before 
now, has written to all of them to acknowledge the receipt of the 
monies from them. The money in excess and which I have kept out with 
only me having knowledge of it, is in the tune of Thirty-Five Million United States Dollars (US$35,000,000.00). As it is now, this money belongs to me, as neither the AU nor any of the donor countries/international agencies has declared their money missing. 


I am therefore contacting you to assist me with the movement and 
safe-keeping of this fund. As a public officer in my category, I 
cannot openly put this money into any bank here in Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia, the AU headquarters where I am now, or in any other part of 
Africa, as an account holder. This will surely raise eyebrows and 
expose me. I have therefore concealed this amount of US$35M in four 
metal trunk boxes, and declared them as artefacts belonging to a 
foreigner. I deposited the boxes with a Security Company based in 
Spain which has an affliate offices in Ghana, Cot d'Ivoire and South Africa. These cities are safe havens for this kind of transaction. 

This transaction will however be hitch-free. So, I would therefore 
want you to be in Banjul, The Gambia for the clearing and claiming of 
this fund. I will furnish you with information/documents on how 

you will stand as the beneficiary of the boxes. I have decided to 
give to you 40% of the total amount involved. 

Please I will want you to contact me on this e-mail address or the 
alternative: (joe_mokoena@fastermail.com). 


Also, you have to assure me of the secrecy and confidentiality in 
this transaction. 

Thanks in anticipation of your valued co-operation. 

Mr. Jonathan Mokoena.

ATTN:
            URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED
You may be surprise to receive this Email from me since you do not know me
personally.
However, I would like to introduce myself. I am Michael Stevens Junior, the
son of Doctor. Simon Stevens. Who was murdered few months ago in Zimbabwe,
as a result of land dispute? Before the death of my father (Dr. Stevens), he
had taken me to Amsterdam and deposit the sum of Fifteen Million United
States dollars (US$15,000,000) in a security company, as he foresaw the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money in question was deposited in a box as
Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. The proposed
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the
farms and establishment of new farms on Swaziland. As you may be aware this
land problem came into force when Zimbabwe president Mr. Robert Mugabe
Introduced the Land Reformed Act of which my father rich farmers and some
black farmers where affected. This resulted to the killing and Mob action by
Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society, a lot of people were
killed because of this Land reformed act of which my dad was one of the
victims. It is against this background that my family and Iaugustim who are
currently staying in Amsterdam decided to transfer my father's money to a
foreign account. Since the Dutch law prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to
open any account or be involved in any financial transaction. As
The eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking
a genuine foreign account where the money could be transferred. I am faced
with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Holland for the fear
of going through the same experience in future since both countries have
similar history. Moreover, The Netherlands foreign exchange policy does not
allow such investment from asylum seekers. I humbly solicit for your
assistance in the following:
1) Pay a short working day visit to Amsterdam the Netherlands so that we see
face to face, Have a table talk that would create confidence in me that the
funds will be safe in your hands and have an agreement from an advocate,
which will be duly and legally sign in his chambers before taken any step in
this transaction.
2) Get the entire necessary document regarding this transaction and claim
the boxes from the security company, open an account in your name with a
local bank here and deposit the money for onward transfer to your designated
account in overseas.
3) Make a good arrangement for investment and do invest the money for me, I
am willing to give you some percentage for your assistance on this, and I
offer you 15%. 5% for any expenses, including your telephone calls and any
other expenses that may arise during this process. 80% would be invested and
you get your wages monthly for managing the funds. Contact me on the above
Email, provide me with your telephone and fax number so we can discuss
further and a chance for you to ask me any question you may have in mind,
while you maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction.
Please kindly get back to me with your detail contacts.
Sincere Regards,
Michael Stevens Junior.

Attention: President C.E.O


                                                      URGENT FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE

I know you will be surprised to hear from me since you dont know me 
personally. I am WILLIAM ZUNGU , the son of Dr. ZUNGU who was recently 
murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through your 
countrys Information Exchange in my search for a reliable and reputable 
person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves a transfer 
of fund into a foreign account and I decided to write to you. The war 
veterans of the ruling Government of President Robert Mugabe for their 
alleged support murdered my late father among the few black Zimbabwean rich 
farmers in cold blood for the Movement of Democratic Change (MDC), which is 
against Mugabes rule.

The land problem arose when Mugabe introduced a New Land Act that wholly 
affected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently condemned the  
modus operadi adopted by the government.

This resulted to rampart killings and mob action by the war veterans and 
thugs. More than 78 people have so far been killed. Heads of Government from 
the West, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their 
condemnation of Mugabes Land Act. Subsequently, South Africa Development 
Community (SADC) has continuously supported Mugabe. It is against this 
background that my family and I who are currently in South Africa have 
decided to transfer this money out of Africa as we no longer feel safe 
anymore and want to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can 
establish ourselves.

Just before my fathers death, he took me to Johannesburg, South Africa to 
deposit the sum of US$30.0000.00 (THIRTY MILION UNITED STATE DOLLARS) with a 
security and finance company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. 
This money was deposited in a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from 
the finance company. This amount was embarking for the purchase of new farms 
machinery and chemicals, as well as the establishment of some new farms in 
Lesotho and Swaziland.

As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of 
seeking for genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred 
into without knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our 
familys wealth and the South African government seems to be playing along. 
I am faced with the dilemma of investing the money here since both countries 
have almost the same history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange 
does not allow such investments as I am seeking for asylum.

As a businessperson whom I have to entrust my future and that of my family, 
I must let you know that there is no risk and the nature of your business 
does not necessarily matter. Therefore, should you be able and willing to 
help me and my family, we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum for 
your assistance, 10% will be set aside for expenses we may incur while the 
rest 60% will be for my family. It is our wish to invest our money on 
commercial property based on your advice and I will also receive assurance 
that you would not sit on this money when transferred into your account.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via my 
EMAIL.please i want you to include your private telephone number for easy 
communication.


Best regards,
William

       {BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY/YOUR ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED}
My name is Mr.Ben Otutu. and I work in the International operation
department in a Local Bank here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred.

If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.

The informations will be as follows.......

Bank Name.........
Bank Address........
A/C Name.............
A/C Number..............
Swift Code No..............
Routing Number................

I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally I will give you 25% for your corporation. I look forward to a favorable response from you.

Thank's for your maxinium co-operation and remain blessed.

Attn:  
Dear Friend, 

I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust to enable my 
colleagues and I carry out an urgent business opportunity in my 
department. 

I work with the Nill Bank of Nigeria PLC; currently I am the senior 
manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of 
my bank. I was the account officer to one Mr. Ali B. Ashan who died 
along  with his family on the 8th of November 1997 in an ADC Boeing 727 
plane crash at Egirin River. All 141 passengers on board were feared 
dead. 

He left in his domiciliary account the total sum of $25.5m,{Twenty 
Five  million, five hundred thousand USA Dollars}. Since the management 
got  the information of his death we have been expecting any of his 
relation 
or his next of kin to come up and claim his money. 

Unfortunately, From the day of his death till the time of this letter  
none of his relation or friends has come up for the claim.The banking  
and financial law of Nill Bank of Nigeria PLC stipulates that if such  
fund remained unclaimed after a period of (7)seven years, it will be 
transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. On this discovery 
sir, I and two other senior staffs now decided to do business with you 
and  release the money to you as the next of kin to Mr. Ali B. Ashan 
for  safety and subsequent disbursement. I will soon proceed for my 
retirement  leave this year, and I personally do not want this fund to 
be  transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is why I 
wanted the 
fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my retirement from 
the banking services by December 15th 2005. 

The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned  
by the fact that the customer Mr. Ali B. Ashan was a foreigner and a  
Nigerian cannot stand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that 
30%  of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner; thereafter my 
colleague and I will visit your country for disbursement according to 
the 
percentages indicated. 

To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated 
account, you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the 
deceased, indicating your bank account number and location where in the 
money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating 
your interest, I will send to you the text of the application that you 
will  send to the Nill Bank of Nigeria PLC authority for an approval to 
submit  your claims. Send your reply through my direct and Private: 
donatus_okobi@excite.com  

Indicate your direct Fax and telephone numbers for effective 
communication that this transaction needs. Do not reply through the 
Nill Bank email address because it's belonged to the senior staffs for 
public use. 

Please note that you are not to appear in person, as everything 
regarding this project will be strictly on documentations and every 
banking  documents needed for this transaction will be taken care of by 
myself. 

Looking forward to urgently hearing from you.

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I really prayed to God to help me choose somebody that will be my true partner. 

My name is James Nandu Savimbi.I am the first son of Mr. Jonas Savinbi, the leader of the UNITA movement in Angola. May be you know that my father was killed recently in Angola by the Angolan Government soldiers and he has since 
been buried. 

Two weeks before he died (May be he knows he will die), he called me and showed me a box containing US$20 million and some Diamond value about US$15 million. He sent the box to a security company in Europe for safe keeping with a false name. 

He give me the certificate of deposit and the code number. With that I can collect the box anytime I want. Now that my father is dead and I need the money to take care of the family left behind of about two wives and six children. 

I am now hiding as the government of Angola is desperately looking for me to assasinate and also the former commander of my father wants to get me at all cost.Also, I have to be very careful of my movement hence my search for you to help me to get the box and keep it until I can escape and meet you and you will also help me to invest the money in your country or where it is good. 

I will give provide you with all the power(necessary documents) to collect the box on my behalf when you tell me in your reply that you will help me and I can trust and count on you. I don't trust anybody in Angola and with the certificate and the code which I will give you, there should/will be no problem in collecting the box. 

You don't have to worry,as this is 100% risk free to you as only me, my dead father and the security company in Europe knows about this box. 

But I want you to keep this secret as there are some enemies of my father scattered all over the whole World who are friends to the government of Angola. The name of the country where the box is in Europe and how much I will give you for help shall be revealed upon your response to my mail. 

1 YOUR FULL NAME 
2. YOUR CONTACT (HOME)ADDRESS 
3. YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER 
4. YOUR DATE OF BIRTH & YOUR OCCUPATION 

I await your quick answer and sorry for poor english if there is any. 

Thank you.

ofu1@aol.com,,"Thu, 18 Jan 2007 02:27:53 -0600",LETTER,"Dear Friend,


With great pleasure I Mr. Donald Ofu Obidima, Credit control Manager of
a Bank (name upheld)is writing you in respect of a foreign customer an
Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum
corporation,Engr.Lee Seunghyo made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for
twelve calendar months valued
at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that Engr.Lee Seunghyo died in Korean Air Flight 801, which
crashed in Guam on August 1997 with other passengers onboard. I
therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Lee
Seunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next
of kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin
or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit
paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the
end of each year.

Since the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the
account with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved
abortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of
USD.$25million, [Twenty five million United States Dollars] which has
been with my branch for a very long time. Since his
death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay
claims for this money asthe heir.

A member of our government trade delegation to your country gave your
impeccable profile to me. Hence I have decided to seek your co-operation
in this business deal due to the sensitivity of this transaction. It may
interest you to know that I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money cannot be approved to a local Bank account here, but
can only be approved to a foreigner with an account since the money is
in US Dollars. I have decided as a matter of urgency upon this discovery
now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the
deceased Engr. Lee Seunghyo as No one has ever come forward to claim
this fund.

In accordance to Nigerian Law, fund deposited for a long period of time
without claim will be reverted to the Nigerian Government treasury if
nobody applies to claim this fund after a long period of time. I want
you to co-operate with me so that the fruits of this man's labour will
not get into the hands of some unsrupulous corrupt government officials
if NOT CLAIMED now. I have secured from the probate an Order of Madamus
to locate any of deceased beneficiaries. Hence I am contacting you with
this proposal.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately the following
below:

1.full names and address
2.Date of Birth
3.Tel & Fax Numbers

So that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the
services of two Attorneys for drafting and notorization of the WILL and
to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration
in your favour for the transfer.

The Bank cannot release the fund from his account unlesssomeone applies
for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking
guidelines. I have almost resolved to finalize this transaction with
some money to secure documents in your name as the bonafide beneficiary
of this fund $25m which guarantees our safety and successful transfer.
With the above suggestion, It is reliable,safe and quick for transfer
process.

At the successful conclusion of this business, your goodself shall be
entitled to have 40% that is, USD$10m of the total money while I will
have 55% that is USD$13.750m and 5% that is USD$1.250m for
communications and other expenses. I am ready to invest a reasonable
percentage of mine into any viable business you suggest as a joint
partner.

Your response is highly imperative as this is a TWO-man business deal
transaction as I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction. I need your
assistance and co-operation to this reality as I have done my Home-work
and fine tune the best way to create you as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch
Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction with you
as the beneficiary to this fund. Your percentage will also be a source
of upliftment.You have absolutely nothing to LOSE in assisting me
instead, you have so much to GAIN. Be rest assured that this transaction
would be most profitable for both of us.

I will appreciate your early reply for commencement of business.Contact
me for acknowledgement by E-mail and whereby you are not interested,
please indicate in your reply so that I can seek for the assistance of
someone else.

Thanks for your expected co-operation and treat ASAP as your utmost

business deal transaction.

The fund (US$423M) in question was approved by the Government of Russia
for payment of various YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers to prevent them from
loosing the money they invested in the numerous contracts they executed
for the above firm. The Government had already concluded plans to frozen
all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and
personal before I connived with the Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who
is also my partner in this transaction) to raise a memo stating that YUKOS

Bill and Exchange Manager 
Foreigner Remittance Dept. 
Bank of Africa 
Phone +226-78-86-11-06 
Dear Friend 
I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance 
department of Bank of Africa Burkina Faso I am writing to seek your consent over a deal in my department. 
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15.5m US dollars ( Fifteen million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 1999 in a plane crash. 
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to th deceased as indicated in our banking gildings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. 
It is therefore upon this discovery that i now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. 
The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after fours years, the money will be transferred into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in 
this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 
i agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me. 
Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. 
Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as 
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted. 
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application . I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. 
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail 
Trusting to hear from you immediately. 
Your faithfully 
Mr Jerry Moi 
Bill and Exchange Manager.

HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONG KONG.

Dear Sir,

 Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. 
 So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years and 6months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

 I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.
 Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.
 Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Mr. Wang  Qin

I am writting this letter out of a genuine desperation to find a reliable partner in the unfolding transaction.I have been unjustly treated by my partner in a transaction so,I seek your help, attention and genuine co-operation to our mutual benefit and 
i believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence i am about to repose on you.

I am MR.FRED OBI,from NIGERIA and for the past ten years,I have been working in a public Relations firm that pays me about 100 hundred dollars each month. On the 30th of june,our company made a very big financial breakthrough when we made contact with ALHAJI DAN MUSA. We began to supply him his cow vaccine named LIM KXT COW VACCINE. ALHAJI DAN MUSA is THE PRESIDENT OF (WICDEL GROUP COMPANY )He is a millionaire farmer with CATTLE FARMS in all part of AFRICA , and a new one located at ABIDJAN COTE D'VOIRE.


Moreover, he is the greatest supplier of cattle beef and other dairy products to the whole of West Africa.HE had informed us about the huge amount of money he spends on the purchase of a particular but very important cattle medicine. Precisely, he buys U
S$5,000 per carton. He asked if our organisation can source for a cheaper supplier.

We did market research and discovered that we can buy these vaccine in Europe for US$2,000 per carton. We moved a proposal to WICDEL GROUP COMPANY, to supply him at US$4,800 per carton which they accepted. As these supplies progressed and our company is 
doing fine,I requested to my boss for an increase in our salary.he was so upset that he sacked me without benefits and ten years of dedicated workmanship.

I was so desperate that I went to the WICDEL GROUP COMPANY farms and infomed ALHAJI DAN MUSA that I have a foriegn contact that will be willing to supply him this same products at US$4,400. Per carton. ALHAJI DAN MUSA in turn confided to me that he is about to place order for one thousand cartons following a suspected outbreak of disease in his farms.I asured ALHAJI DAN MUSA that my foreing contact will be in the position to manufacture and supply to him,infact I convinced him that my former boss usually buy from my foriegn contact and that is why he sales to him at a higher price. HOWEVER,I INFORMED ALHAJI DAN MUSA THAT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY CASH IN ADVANCE BEFORE MY FORIEGN CONTACT WILL SUPPLY TO HIM. For the moment he has stopped all contact with my boss.

Please consider on how to handle this profitable project and kindly contact me immediately through my private e-mail: fredobi@indiatimes.com 

for more details and negotiations as regards my commission.However,I will insist that my commission will be 20% of the total profit.

Note : We will buy one thousand carton at US$2,000,000. We sell to them at US$4,400,000 Dollars, our client pays cash before lifting of the goods. (They must not know our purchase point in (Europe).


Thanks and God bless you.

Unfortunately they All lost their lives in the event of the
accident.

Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to
locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also
proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful
attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the
Internet to locate any member of his family but of no
avail, hence I contacted you.I contacted you to assist in
repartrating the money and property left behind by my
client before they get confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were
lodged. Particularly,the Bank where the deceased had an
account valued at about US$15.2M (Fifteen  Million Two
Hundred Thousand United Stated Dollars). 
 
Conseqently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the
next of kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have
been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2
years now. I seek your consent to present you as the next
of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country
so that the proceeds of this account valued at
US$15.2million can be paid to you and then you and me can
share the money. 60% to me and 40%
to you.
 
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to
back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest
co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I
guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the

Dear Sir/Madam
I am Dr Martins Awele Chairman of the Tender Committee
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). My Committee is
principally
concerned with payment of all contract awarded from 1999 to date, in 
order
of priority as regard capital projects of the NNPC.
The information we gathered from the Foreign Office
of the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industries is so positive as to
convince us that you would provide us with solution to a money transfer
deal valued at Thirty One Million United States Dollars and 
subsequently
a joint business venture.

In the course of our duties as values, and project
inspectors for the on-going liquefied Natural Gas
(LNG) project, we have over-invoiced the value of
somejobs done by foreign contractors for the NNPC to the tune of 
US$31M.

Installation of 250,000.00 Monax
Turbine$10,000.000.00
Turn Around Maintenance $5,000,000.00
Our aim of over-invoicing this payment is to divert
the excess amount to a discrete account abroad. This fund is now 
floating
in suspense account at the Central Bank of
 Nigeria (CBN).
This is the fund my colleagues and I have decided to transfer into your
account since we, as civil servants are not allowed to operate or own
foreign
account.
The money will be shared as follows after
 transfer:30% for you (Account Owner)
 60% for me and my colleagues 10% to off-set both
local and international expenses thatWould be incurred in the course of
this transaction.
To be able to claim the funds, we will be purporting your company to be
the original contractor / beneficiary of the funds so all procedures 
for
international transfer shall be strictly followed,as we have worked out
all modalities for a swift and riskfree transfer.

If this proposal satisfies you, please contact me via E-mail OR fax 
number
234-1-7592412
with the following important information. Bank Name / Address Account 
Name
Account Number and your Personal Phone / Fax Numbers for easy

During our investigation and auditing in this security company my department  came across a consignment belonging to a deceased person who died on plane  crash with this security company without any claim of the consignment in our  custody either form his family or relation before our discovery to this development.

Mean while all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonfire next of kin to the deceased, will be relayed to you as soon as you  indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great deal. In fact I could have done this deal alone but  because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not  allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eyebrow on  my side during the time of transfer because I work in this company.  This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who  will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to  the security company and also present a foreign account where he will need  the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due  verification and clarification by designation back account.  I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% we be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the fine of transfer and also telephone  bills, while 60% will be for me and by partners.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank 
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this development.


The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United 
States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive 
information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement 
to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get 
the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been 
put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as 
soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also 
benefit your self to this great business opportunity.


In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from 
to your own designation bank account.


I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and 
internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have 
been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.


I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when 
I hear from you.


I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,


Yours faithfully,


Mr Mohamat Ali.

Attn: Sir, 

Greetings you must be aware now that my country The Republic of South Africa 
won the bid to host the world cup by 2010,prior to this bid my committee was 
mandated to lobby the members of board of Federation International Football 
Association (FIFA) on selection of the 
country to host the world, the bidding was intensive but at the end we got 
the hosting right. Mycommittee was given the sum of $29 million dollars to 
lobby the members of the FIFA ruling body to make sure that we win the 
hosting right considering the gain that comes with the hosting right like 
South Africa?s economy will receive a massive direct boost from hosting the 
2010 World Cup, 

financial impact report for South Africa's World Cup bid committee shows 
that the 2010 World Cup will pump R21.3-billion into South Africa's economy, 
and creating an estimated 159 000 new jobs.With the help the living legend 
of our time 85-year-old Nobel  Peace Prize winner Dr. Nelson Mandela who 
made an emotive case for The  Republic of South Africa, we got the bid 
without spending all the money, I and my committee members saw this as a God 
sent opportunity to secure our future and that of our family therefore was 
mandated by other committee members to look for a way to move the remaining 
money  to a safe place with the  help of a foreigner who we can trust and is 
ready to assist us to move the funds considering the fact that we are 
still members of the bid committee and in the eyes of the public. we have in

I am Mrs Joy Williams from Solomon Islands. I am married to Mr. Lobi Williams who worked with our Embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.

Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $8.5 Million with a Bank in Cote D lvoire.

Presently this money is still in the custody of the Bank in Cote D lvoire.Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church,organization or good person that will utilize 
this money the way I am going to instruct herein.I want a 
church,organization or good person that will use this fund
for orphanages, widows and other peoples that needs help and also propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that""Blessed is the hand that giveth"".l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband elatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that responsible for the death of my husband in 
other to have all my late husband prperties and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death.

This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development and l know that With God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Cote d' lvoire. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want 
you, church or the organization to always pray for me because the lord is my only shephard.

My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.

Contact me on the this email address and any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good person, church,organization for this same purpose.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your response immedaitely.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.

EMAIL:   williamsd1@rediff.com

Dear Friend,
 
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent
need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray
that you view it seriously. My name is MR WILLIAMS DANIEL of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the
close aides to the former President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately 
decided to divert the fund into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security
of the said amount is presently being threatened here
following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)
a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from
our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent
Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money
out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under
Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe
in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic
Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not
pass through normal custom/airport screening and
clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed
good friends (western countries) who suddenly became
hostile to those of us who worked with the late
President Kabila, immediately after his son took
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each
other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and
convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this
transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a
total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email
address above with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You
to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter
extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,
while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
GodBless.
 
Best Regards
MR WILLIAMS DANIEL

STANDARD BANK SA

E-MAIL: pet_wang@standardbanksa.net
Dear Sir,


                                   HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

Greetings.

This mail may come to you as a surprise but I plead with you to patiently
read through it before making a decision whether to assist me or not.

I wish to solicit for your assistance in the transaction which I strongly
believes will be of mutual benefit to both of us if treated with trust and
confidentiality that it deserve.

My name is Mr. Peter Wang Qin, the branch manager of a reputable bank
in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, in the Republic of South Africa. I and
two of my colleagues wish to seek your assistance in the transfer of some
huge sum of money into a foreign bank account.

This money was deposited seven years ago in a fixed deposit account in my
bank by an Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Mining
Corporation. (Name deliberately withheld for now) The length of time for the
maturity of the fixed deposit was five years, which expired towards the
ending of last year. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his
forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, a reminder was also sent and finally we discovered from his
Contract Employers - The South African Mining Corporation that the Depositor
died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that
the depositor/beneficiary actually died in a car Accident here in South
Africa, in May 2000 and he left nobody as next-of-kin to claim this money.
All efforts made to trace any known relations of his proved abortive, and no
one has written our bank in this regard.

Hence, this said money is still lying in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. Now its clear
no one will ever come forward to claim it. And according to the Laws of
Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 5(five) Years, the money will
revert to the ownership of The South African Government if nobody applies to
claim the fund.

All modalities for the successful transfer of this money into an offshore
bank account have been put in place and we are looking for a trust worthy
foreign partner into whose bank account this fund would be remitted to and
it is this regard that my colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner
who will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total
amount if you should accept to assist us.



If you are interested in giving us the required assistance, kindly reply
this mail stating your Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of
the secrecy surrounding this transaction, l suggests that you contact me
only through e-mail, until further notice.

I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you soon. Feel free to ask
any question in this regard.

I remain,

Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Peter Wang Qin

the transaction successfully from your side are welcome.

Acting on  consent and high recommendation from close associates I

government parastals of which the Nigerian Electric Power Autority

is one of such parastals.

We have sucessfully amassed the sum of Twenty Three Million United
State
Dollars ($23million) for ourselves which was accrued as a result of
over-invoiced
reciepts from sales of shares of other government parastals. We intend
to transfer this fund out of this country to a foreign offshore
account,
but being that we are still in active government service, we are not
allowed to transfer any money or own foreign accounts.

Inlight of this we have decided to solicit for your assistance in the
provision of a foreign account where we can transfer this fund to. For
your assistance we have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund,
which
is  Four Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars($4.6million),

aside for any expense incurred in the process of this mutually
beneficial
transaction.

TEL +27 83 486 2761

DEAR ,

This letter was borne out of my sincere desire to establish a 
business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through the 
international trade and commerce (ITCC).

My name is Ibram Kamara the son of late Chief Abraham P.Kamara (the former 
deputy minister of finance under the ousted civilian government) who was 
killed and mutilated by the military junta led by major, Paul Koroma after 
overthrowing the elected government of president Tejan. Through, I do not 
know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbance in 
Sierra-Leone but the pressure of war drove my mother and I out of Sierra 
-Leone into exile in South Africa where we have been living under political 
asylum for years.

Sadly, my mother died of cancer 2 months ago and was buried here in South 
Africa . Prior to her death, she handed me over a certificate meant for a 
secret deposit, which my father made in a security/finance company in europe 
the deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S dollars) this 
was the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers in the heat 
of the conflict. He made the deposit in his name and also deposited it as a 
family tresures, with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the 
end of the war but he was killed when the conflict intensified as a result 
of his opposition to the rebel forces. I have contracted the 
Security/finance Company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.

Due to the death of my Mother, I have decided to solicit for the 
participation of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will 
assist in acting as my representative who will jointly signed the agreement 
for the safe keeping of the money in the security/finance company. The 
security/finance company don't know the content of the consignment, they 
believe that it is African artefact. As contained in 2 trunk boxes. 
Unfortunately, My mum who is surpose to assist me in releasing the 
consignment has died of cancer that is why I am looking for your assistance. 
I cannot do it alone due to my present social status and total ignorance of 
the business world. I shall also give you 20% of the funds for your 
assistance to relocate this fund to your country and for re-investment while 
the rest will be kept in any account of your choice for inverstmant purpose. 
i would have done the transfer myself as my name is written as the next of 
kin,but because of my present status in this country as a refugee i will not 
be allowed to handle such money or else it will be confisticated by the 
goverment if found in my possetion,and also i will not be allowed to open an 
account as a refugee not even to talk of inversting such an amount of 
money,these are the reasons why i need your assistance,If you are interested 
in helping me out of this my present situation, contact me immediately 
through my email and i will funish you with other details you need to 
conclude this transaction.this transaction is absolutely risk free and of 
biliteral benefits as i have all neccesray legal documents backing it 
up.please get back to me with your full name,tel.no fax no and also your 
home addres so as to enable me introduce you to the security/finance company 
handling the consignment as my representative.after all these you will then 
make an arrangement on how we are going to meet face to face and discuss in 
details.

Meanwhile, I cannot travel out because i have no travelling documents for 
now,i also hope that after everything you will secure a visa for me to join 
you in your country so that i can continue my studies over there. I hope to 
hear from you soon

Best regards,
MR IBRAM KAMARA

JOHNSON ELENDU <jelendu@nzoomail.com>,R@M,,BUSINESS PROPOSAL,"PLEASE TREAT AS ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL 
FROM THE DESK OF JOHNSON ELENDU. 
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. 
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. 
UNION BANK PLC. 
REPLY STRICTLY VIA: [jelendu2@indiatimes.com]
Attn: sir, 

Permit me to introduce myself to you, My name is Johnson Elendu., I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I work for (Union Bank, Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of Foreign Exchange Operations (International Remittance). I am contacting You presently because I need your urgent assistance in a business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us. 
I have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been 
declared ""UNCLAIMED"" by the chairman and some members of the board of 
directors of our bank. The money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever, Late Engr. Manfred Becker, I was his personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria. 
Engr. Manfred Becker an American citizen was a contractor with the 
Federal Government of Nigeria, he supplied and installed equipment and his company Creek land Contractors completed some of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing balance in the Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$40.Million) has been tagged Unclaimed because no relative of Engr. Becker has come forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in Nigeria. This invariably 
is an attempt to infuse more money into the acquisition of military 
equipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an already prostrate Africa. 
This of course, is senseless, hence my mission. 
My colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating 
persons that could be remotely related to Engr. Becker and we have been doing this 
for about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this enterprise and I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard. 

We have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We will provide you with answers to all the security questions, which you will have to answer to move the process towards completion. We will also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You may however not need to make any appearance; every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS] for your participation you will get 30%, 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and I. 

I make this proposal in trust and in good faith, therefore, if you are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not interested, then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way. 

Thank you and best regards.

Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I am KEN GREEN KABILA,the
son of the former head of state/ president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called
Zaire) Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila.

I am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on this confidential
Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us.
Before I go into further details please be informed that I am writing without
any other person(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction.
Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.
I have the sum of USD55Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my father
before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th
2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to security reasons,as
my narration below will explain. But before I continue b e well informed that
your share in this transaction has been calculated at 15% of the total sum of
USD$55M, 5% for expenses and the rest for my family and me.

My father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having
married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my father, My step
brother Joseph, who is the current president of my country, is the son of the
first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.

Already president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and
private property, which my father left behind for the whole family. Now my
mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late father's
wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your assistance to help
us receive these funds overseas for proper investment.
Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction because the
diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pa ttern that shows no direct
trace or linkage with us (Kabi! la family). At present the money is in cash and is
secured in a financial institution company as consignment.
The consignment will be released within seven (7) days of my being in receipt
of your reply via my email address above only for security reasons.

I am waiting for your swift and favorable response, and in case you have any
question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.my alternative email is ken_kabil40@zwallet.com

you can call me mmediately on my private phone number which is :229-988-039.

claim his funds of us$.57 m, [Fifty seven million

for a very long time.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name
could be used as the next of kin as no one has come up
to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here
does not allow such money to stay more than seven
years, because the money will be recalled to the bank
treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of
this I got your contact through my search via business
report from your web site to see if you can assist. I
will give you 25% of the total.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you

bring to your notice that this business is hitch free
and that you should not entertain any fear as all
modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within
five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a

LAGOS, NIGERIA

GOOD DAY FRIEND

ATTENTION:SIR/MADAM

I am MR.VICTOR KOVIS, the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.

I have resolved to contact you through this medium
based on business proposal that will be of mutual
benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through
a consultant company base on my research for a
trustworthy and established person that understands
investment ethic for entering into a life time
profitable joint partnership investment and also
co-operation with confidence and trust that you will
keep the contents secret and divulged to any third
party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of o! urs deposited a
consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.
And since then our client has failed to come forward
to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a
considerable amount of money in demurrage.

Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to
redeem the demurrage which his consignment had
accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.

Since the death of our client President Mobutou
Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to
claim the consignment with us, which means that non of
his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to
secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited
in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the
two boxes that were registered as treasure! r by our
client actually contained a considerable amount of
money in United States Dollars amounting to about
US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have
been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from
enquiries and the foreign media that our late client
siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was
in office as head of state.

It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault
was part of the money that our client siphoned and now
that he is dead there is no race to this money in our
care.

I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me
in transferring this money out of nigeria to your
country for immediate investment with your assistance.
I have also decided that you will generously be
entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt
of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me
of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and
transfer all the rights of ownership of thisconsignment to
your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the

complete funds to your
country.

you have nothing to worry about, as I will be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.

Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this
matter.

Please reply to the above email address with your
telephone and fax so that i can call you.

Thanks.

Yours faithfully.

Good Day,

l am Mr.Chris Kolade, Civil Servant in the Ministry of Health. l know
this proposal will come to you as a surprise because we have not met
before either physically or through correspondence. I got your contact
from our chamber of commerce here in Nigeria and have no doubt in your
ability to handle this proposal involving huge sum of money.My father
Chief Isama Kolade (Now Late) was the Royal Head of my community, ELEME
(an oil rich town) in Nigeria. My community produces 5.8% of the total
crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the Dollar value of each!
barrel is paid to my father as royalty by the Federal Government.
My father was also the Chairman of ISAMA Special Oil Trust Fund. In his
position as the Royal head and Chairman of the Oil Trust Fund, he made
some money which he left for me as the only heir to inherit.The money
is Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars(US$18.5). This
Money originated from the accumulated royalties between 1976-1998
Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and political instability as a
result of past Military rules (1985-1999) ,he deposited this Money in a
Strong Room""VAULTS"" with an open beneficiary in a security company
pending when he would finish arrangement to transfer it abroad.He was
planning this when he died late last year of Heart Attack.
Just before my father died he called my attention to the money and
charged me to look for a foreigner who would assist me in the
transfer/investment of the funds abroad. So l would be very grateful
if you could accept to help me achieve this great objective.I promise to
give you 15% of the total funds transferred to your vital Bank account
as compensation for your assistance. Five percent (5%)has been set
aside to take care of all expenses we may incure during the
transaction.
To indicate your interest,contact me urgently and confidentially for
more information and the roles you will play in this business. All the
legal Documents concerning this Money will be sent to you as soon as we
agreed ether.Please I will appreciate that you send your telephone/fax
numbers to enable me contact you immediately for discussions.
May the almighty God bless you.
Yours faithfully,
Mr.Chris Kolade.

Dear,
I am Dr FRED WILLIAMS ,the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign
remittance department
of ECOBANK.As a matter of facts, I got your address in
LOME
chamber of commerce during one of my research work in the state library
to see if I could get a capable hand to assist me in this proposal.
However, in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 30 m US
dollars
(Thirty Millon US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our
foreign customer Engr. Lee Yung who died along with his entire family in
a concord plane
crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the whole life of the
pasengeres on board.Engr. Lee Yung was a contractor with the Federal
Republic of Togo, he supplied and installed equipment to some construction
companies in the country.
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next
of

leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery
that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin
or
relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody

treasury as unclaimed Bill.
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained
unclamed after three years, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of

and an indigene of Togo cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my

PERSONAL/STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am delighted to contact you on a private note based on your claim to your contract fund, which has been programmed for transfer into your designated bank account through my department.
I am hereby apologizing to you for the delay in releasing this fund into your account, which was caused by me because of breach of agreement between me and your so called partners in Nigeria who introduced you into this business.
Your Nigeria partners approached me that they want to present you as a beneficiary to this fund as it was an OVER-INVOICING made when they are awarding contract to foreign firms. So after the negotiation, we unanimously agreed that they (your partners) would give me the sum of US$200,000.00(CASH) on my acceptance to assist them to transfer the fund into your account. When I accepted the offer, they forwarded all your banking particulars to me for onward transfer. As soon as I made some fruitful efforts on the business and demanded my US$200,000.00 as agreed, your partners deviated from the agreement and decided to go through the International Remittance Department at my back and made a change of your bank account in other to disappoint me and not knowing that the International Remittance Department is also under my control. Then I got the knowledge of their evil plans and prove their illicit efforts abortive. That is why for many months you have been pursuing this payment, spending unnecessary funds to some fraudulent individuals in Nigeria who claimed to be in charge to release your fund.
I want to re-emphasize to you that your funds is still with me and under my control. Now with my whole heart, I want to enter into real business with you on a sincere agreement since your partners has disappear into tin-air and nowhere to be found and the fund is still floating in your name waiting for a proper documentation and claims.
1. On an agreement, I assure you that I am going to transfer this fund into your account.
2. You will assure me of keeping my dealings with you to an utmost secretary because of my position.
3. You will promise to give me 20% of the total fund as soon as the fund gets into your account with a written promissory note signed by you.
4. I will assist you in making a proper documentation to make claims genuine, as a bonafide Foreign Contractor and beneficiary to the said fund.
5. Reconfirmation of your receiving bank account so as to avoid wrong remittance.
6. Your private phone and fax numbers, this is important for confidential issues and payment release instructions.
I am aware that some fraudulent individuals has been impersonating my name and office to contact you and other contractors as reported by the Central Bank of Nigeria authorities. I advise you that henceforth, you should suspend any dealings from any group of person(s) either from the CBN or any other financial institution/parastatals in Nigeria or Overseas that might be contacting you in this purpose and endeavor to keep this information confidential until we finalize this transaction.

DANANI REFUGEE CAMP 
C/O ROCK OF AGES EVANGELICAL MINISTRY 
Accra,Ghana 

Hello Please, 

With the best compliments of the year, I wish to 
solicit your help in migrating to your country and 
investing my funds. I am a Sierra Leonean National and the wife of late 
Dr. SIMON SAMBU. Until his death, my husband was the 
General overseer of the Gold and Diamond Mining 
Corporation in Kanema Sierra Leone. During the crisis the military
forces loyal to the 
Government of AHMED TIJAN KABBAH invaded the Diamond 
and Gold mine and assassinated my husband, mistaking him for his brother
MR.MIKE SAMBU who is the 
deputy to the leader of the Revolutionary United 
Front (RUF ) FODAY SANKOH. When the news reached me, 
I hurriedly gathered some valuables in our family 
villa and escaped for my dear life in the company of 
my only son SILAS SAMBU and left some other valuables 
since I was in a haste and lost some. Among the 
valuables I collected was a file that contained 
details of a Deposit in a Vault my husband made in a 
security company in Europe. 
He deposited US$8M (Eight Million U.S Dollars) 
contained in one box in the name of our son SILAS SAMBU. He did not
disclose the real contents of 
the Box to the Security Company. He Declared the 
contents as Family Valuables for safety reasons. This 
is the money he made from the sale of Gold and 
diamonds during his time as the General overseer. Now that we are in
Accra,Ghana and verified the 
transaction, we need your assistance to move this 
funds out of the security company for investment in 
your country as we cannot invest here due to its 
nearness to our country and the insecurity still going 
on there. We ask you to scout for a viable and 
lucrative business, so that we can invest wisely. We 
have it in mind to give you 10% of the total sum of 
(8 million US Dollars), and 12% share for you in any 
investment we will embark upon with our share of 90% 
if you assist us. We will also set aside 5% of the 
funds for ancillary expenses which you will make in 
course of this transaction. 
This fortune of ours we have revealed to you should 
remain CONFIDENTIAL as it is only you who we have told 
about it. Kindly indicate your interest and 
willingness to assist us on receipt of this message 
for us to clarify you on how to proceed. Note that this transaction is
risk free. 
May the shelter and care of God be upon you as you 
assist us. 
Remain blessed.

Good a thing to write you,which however is not mandatory nor will in any manner compel you to honour against your will.
 
Dearest we are Gordon and Rose Wiliams ,of our late Parents Mr and mrs Victor Williams. Our Father was a highly reputable business magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Lagos during His days. 
 
It is sad to say that He passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad.
 
Though His sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of ours who travelled with Him at that time. But God knows the truth!Our mother died when we where small ,and since then our Father took us so special.
 
Before His death, My father called me and told  me that he has the sum of (USD$12.500,000) ( MILLION UNITED STATES  DOLLARS )deposited with an international bank in Republic Nigeria  west Africa. He further told me that He deposited the money with the name  of a business partner while I am the next of kin to the deposited money.
 

>From Gordon and Rose
We are just young 16 and 18 years old and a high school college people, with  little knowledge of business that is why We are in need of a partner whom  will assist us to get this fund released for investments in his or her country while I proceed with our education,
 
Dear,
We are in a sincere desire of your humble assistance on this regard, and your suggestions and ideas will be highly appreciated.
Now permit me to ask these few questions?
 
1. Can you honestly do this transaction with Us ?
2.can We completely trust you?
 
Please,Consider this and get back to us as soon as possible so that we can give you the full informations that will be need. And We will want you to know that you are the frist person we have contacted for this transaction.

MY DEPARTMENT I DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM FF ($31.500.000 U.S) THIRTY ONE 
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSANDS US DOLLARS). IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO 
ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMER WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON 25TH 
JULY, 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [FLIGHT AF4590] WITH THE WHOLE PASSENGERS 
ABOARD.

ON 25TH JULY, 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [FLIGHT AF4590] WITH THE WHOLE 
PASSENGERS ABOARD. THE NAME OF THE DECEASED MAN WAS

(MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER FROM MUNICH GERMANY)
N.B. IN OTHER FOR YOU TO BELIEVE ME HONESTLY, VISIT THE WEB SITE TO ENABLE 
YOU KNOW WHETHER WE CAN WORK TOGETHER, BELOW IS THE WEBSITE.

      http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS NEXT OF 
KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CAN NOT RELEASE IT UNLESS 
SOMEBODY APPLIES FOR IT AS NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS 
INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE IEARNT THAT ALL HIS 
SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION DIED ALONGSIDE WITH HIM AT THE PLANE CRASH 
IEAVING NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM.

IT IS THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAT I NOW DECIDED TO MAKE THIS 
BUSINNESS PROPOSAL TO YOU AND RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR 
RELATION TO THE DECEASED FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT SINCE NOBODY 
IS COMING FOR IT AND I DONT WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS 
UNCLAIMED BILL.

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINE HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED 
UNCLAMED AFTER FIVE YEARS, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO THE BANK 
TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED FUND.THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS 
BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A 
BURKINABE CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER.

I AGREE THAT 30 % OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS FOREIGN PARTNER, IN 
RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF A FOREIGN ACCOUNT, 10 % WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR 
EXPENSES INCURED DURING THE BUSINESS AND 60 % WOULD BE FOR ME AND MY 
COLLEAGUES.

THEN AFTER I AND MY COLLEAGUES WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR DISBURSEMENT 
ACCODING TO THE PERCENTAGES INDICATED.

THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRNANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOU AS ARRANGED, 
YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS RELATIONS OR NEXT OF KIN OF THE DECEASED 
INDICATING YOUR BANK NAME, YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER, YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE 
AND FAX NUMBER FOR EASY AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND LOCATION WHERE IN 
THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED . UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY, I WILL SEND TO YOU 
BY FAX OR EMAIL THE TEXT OF THE APPLICATION.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS HITCH FREE 
AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY ATOM OF FEAR AS ALL REQUIRED 
ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSFER . YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME 
IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER.
TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU IMMEDIATELY.

1 Angel Court, London, EC2R 7HJ


Dear SIR,

I am Mr. William Regal, the Branch Manager of Financial Security Assurance here in London. 

In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$6,500,000.00 (Six million five hundred thousand united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers, who died on 2nd January 2000, along with his entire family as a result of an automobile crash. Since his death none of his relations or next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir, this is the basically the reason why I have contacted you. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our operating guidelines. 

It is upon this discovery I now humbly request your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, so that the funds can be released in your favor as the beneficiary next of kin. I shall compensate you with 30% of the total sum for your assistance.

Please, if this proposal is acceptable by you, kindly get back to me via my private email address provided below and furnish me with your full name, address and telephone number. Upon receipt of your mail, I shall bring to your knowledge detailed information on how this deal would be transacted.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards, 

Mr. William Regal

How are you today?

Exactely two months and one week after i came to meet my father with the help of US consulates he died, he was very sick when i came to meet him. Before their death in a private specialist hospital, my father called me on his bed side and secretly confided to me the sum of US$10 million dollars which he deposited in one of the banks in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire for onwardly transfer abroad for investment.

The reason i am telling you is that i am just a girl and there is little or nothing i could do on my own and again if my late father relative find out that my late father left that kind of money in my care i don't know what they might do to me, so i need you to help me contact the Bank as my late father foriegn business partner and claim the money for me as my friend and Guandian, and take me along with you.

Dear Friend,


I write to seek your cooperation as my foreign partner and your assistance to enable me to own properties and invest in the stable economy of your country. I apologize if this mail message does not  suit your personal or business ethics. My names are JOHN ODRISCOLL an attorney to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who was based in the U.K., Also referred to as my client.   On the 25th of July 2000, my client, his wife and their two Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world cruise, Since then, I have been managing his properties here in the U.K. and some of his properties, which he put out for sale.

 Which I monitored the payment as his attorney, has been bought and paid for. Now the money paid was deposited into his account. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by his bank. Particularly, the bank has issued me a notice to provide any of his next of kin or have the account confiscated within a short time. My late client has an account valued at 15.5 million dollars. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for some time now, and with the bank giving me  deadline, I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased, so that the proceeds of this account valued at 15.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you, and I can share the money. 50% to me amounting to  7,750,000.00 dollars and 40% for you amounting to US$6,200.000.00 and 10% amounting to US$1,550,000.00 for miscellaneous expenses that might arise.

Mike Kamokai <m_kamokai2004@yahoo.co.uk>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Wed, 23 Mar 2005 19:35:59 +0000",Proposal,"Dear Sir,
 
First I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction and I pray that my contacting you will be given genuine approval considering the fact that we don't know each other before. I wish to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you. I am mike kamokai, I am writing to inform you of my desire to invest, and to buy a house in your country.

 

 I am the first son of Chief Joseph kamokai who was the former Para month ruler of saradungu village of Sierra-Leone .my father was attacked by the R U F rebels on his way to Lucia a northern part of Sierra-Leone and my father sustained injuries and he died three days. 

 

Before he died he revealed to me about the two boxes containing $50 million u s dollars. Which he deposited with a security company in Ghana for safe keeping. My father did not disclose the content of the boxes to the security company. To avoid the officials from raising eye brows. 

 

 

Presently I and my mother are here in Ghana to notify the security company of the claims, and we are staying in the refugee camp. 

 

Therefore I want you to lecture me on how best we can invest this money in your country, because my father told me that it is dangerous to invest in Africa to avoid suspicions, and due to market instabilities coupled with economic and political situation facing Africa for your assistance myself and my mother have agreed to offer you 20% of the total amount of the money. 

We have all the vital documents covering the deposit and the ownership which I can send to you.
. 
Note, I have never disclosed this transaction to anybody apart from you. So please keep it very very confidential. Call me on this number line 00233244774480. 
 
 
Thanks.

 Best regards.

miriam kolo <miriamkolo67@hotmail.com>,,"Wed, 06 Jun 2007 17:34:58 -0600",Good Day,"AB 01 COCODYTreshville Abidjan My Name is Miriam; I worked as a maid to Mr. ROBERT BUTLER an American, who used to be a contractor with an oil servicing company based here in Cote D’Ivoire. Last year,{Jan. 2006} my master died of a serious illness, but before his death, he told me in confidence of a fund of Twenty Seven Million dollars (US$27,000,000.00) which he concealed in two trunk boxes and  deposited with a finance House in Cote D’Ivoire. However, the Finance house does not know the true content of the trunk to be cash as my Master declared upon deposit as containing art craft for export. Because of the fast deteriorating state of his health, he was afraid that he might die loosing all he has in a foreign country. He instructed me that if he dies, I should try everything within my capability to make sure that his fund at the safe keeping house gets into the hands of the less privileged in his home country and he handed over the documents of this deposit to me with a written instruction.  I have contacted the finance house over this issue, but they refused to release the trunk Boxes to me, unless I bring any of Mr. ROBERT BUTLER'S relatives. This is a very tough situation for me, because since I lived with my master, he has not mentioned any of his family or extended relatives and Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now, I seek your consent to present you to the finance house as an extended relative of my master so that the trunk boxes can be released to you and you will use some part of the money inside for the good purpose of my master while the both of us share the remaining..
If you can handle this with me, kindly respond back immediately and we will negotiate on what will be given to you for your kind effort.
Thanking you for your cooperation.

Tel.: +234-802-2329001
Email: mu2018@yahoo.com

Dear Sir,

          STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION

I am CHIEF MAXWELL UDOKA, the Principal Accountant with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation {NNPC}, Headquarters Lagos. I am writing on behalf of my colleages in the Nigerian National Peretroleum Corporation {NNPC} and have been assigned to seek for the assistance of a reliable Foreign Company through which we can transfer the sum of Thirty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars {USD$31,500,000.00}. This money is now depostied in the NNPC Treasur Accorunt with the Central bank of Nigeria {CBN}.

ORIGIN OF THE FUND
This sum arose from the deliberate over-invoicing of a contract awared by the NNPC to a Foreign Firm in the twinlight days of the last military regime. This contract has been completely executed and commisoned and the contractor that handled this contract has collected his full and final payment thus leaving behind the above stated amount which represent the over-invoiced sum. 

We have been safe-guarding this money waiting for conducive time for its transfer out of the country for our personal use. However, the code of employment does not allow us {civil servants} to own and operate foreign accounts and because the contract was handled by a foreign firm and the payment made in Dollars, we now need a foreign partner that will present himself as the sub-contractor so that the money will be transferred into his company's or personal account. 

Your address was made abailable to us by a very good friend who works with the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry. He assured us of your company's viability and capability in business transactions. This assurance gave us the courage to link you up in this pareticular transaction and I hope it will be of mutual benefit to all of us. Note that the nature of your business is not particularly relevant to the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to present yourself as the sub-contractor by providing your bank informations so that the fund will be transferred into your account.

SHARING RATIO
For your assistance in this business, your share will be 25% of the total money. I and my colleagues will take 65% while 10% has been mapped out for any expenses that might be incured in the course of this transaction. If you are willing to assist us in this business, send the following informations: 

1.}  Name of your Bank and address
2.}  Your account number/beneficiary's name
3.}  Your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication

This information will enable us put an application for payment approval to the concerned ministries and final to the Central Bank of Nigeria {CBN} and it is going to last for 10 to 14 banking days, starting from the day we recieve the above informations. All modalities for the take off of this business transaction has been worked out and further action will commence immediately we hear from you.

I am waiting for your reply by the above email.

Thanks for your understanding and due co-operation.

CLEMENT APUTE <clem-apute@consultant.com>,R@M,"Thu, 05 Dec 2002 19:03:38 -0800",PARTNERSHIP,"Subject: BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Importance: HIGH


Good day,
 This might seem very deplorable for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law.
 
I am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. 

The present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment.

My sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power. 

It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family.

This man is bent on destroying my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family.

All their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day.
 His administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of
hatred to my client's family. 

Right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently.
 
Presently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe.

The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence.

Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. 

All we require from you is to help the family
to go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions.

Secondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies.
 As their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. We will be providing you with
all the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. 
Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together.

 We will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership. 

Please do inform me on your decision immediately, so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my secured
email:clem-aputa@earthling.net
 
I will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better. 

Regards, 


Clement Apute. Esq.

,bongowale2001@yahoo.co.in,,ASKING FOR  ASSISTANCE,"
FROM BONGO WALE
JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
TELL:+27-732112866.

Dear sir,

I am MR, BONGO WALE, the son of late
MR.PATRICK WALE, who was murdered in a land dispute
in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for
reliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My
late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the
ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South
Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars
($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he
knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was
deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much
dumourage from the security firm.
This money was earmarked for the purchase of new
machinery and chemicals for the farms and the
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.
This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE
introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the
White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently
condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the
government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob
actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South
Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided
to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the
Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher
transfer of the money to a foreign country where we
can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of
claiming/investing this amount of money in South
Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in
future since both countries have the same political
history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does
not allow such investment hence I am seeking for
an asylum or refugee.
I must let you know that this business is 100% risk
free and the nature of your business does not
necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us
claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have
agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be
for a joint business venture I will be doing with you
and another 35% will be for me and my family which we
shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%
will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure
during the transaction.
Therefor, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance. Please funish me your private phone and Fax
number
for easy and better communication.
Remember that this is highly confidential and the
success of this business depends on how secret it is kept.

Expecting your reply soonest.
Best Regard.

Hong Kong Branch
Two Exchange Square
Central, Hong Kong
Fax: +852-301-66259

http://www.lloydstsb.com.hk

Thank you for giving me your time,it is of great importance for you to  
take care and understand every word which I have written down below;  
please be patient and read my email.

I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc here in Hong Kong attached in  
Private Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer  
and an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of  
fact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep  
the contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the  
integrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I  
contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is  
informed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with  
certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.

In 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank  
to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services  
Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37  
million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over  
(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made  
numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief  
operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department,  
especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.  
We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed,  
and however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with  
prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start  
by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200  
managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the  
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our  
first months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included,  
stood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this  
margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk  
guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the  
money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment  
requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the  
funds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that  
our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and  
in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a  
9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory  
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I  
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.  
Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the  
incidents of 9/11.

I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in  
mainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I  
followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds  
deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist  
private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and  
blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake  
transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly  
private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and  
well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was  
deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his  
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication  
we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year,  
we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of  
that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I  
was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking  
sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not  
understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made  
futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating  
him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days  
later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead,  
a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart  
attack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather  
more information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank  
immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of  
kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his  
estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who  
patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels  
of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he  
listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an  
account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are  
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the  
accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of  
having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring  
that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they  
nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not  
nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our  
care, in this case; he died in testate.

In line with our internal processes for account holders who have  
passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to  
determine who should have right to claim the estate, this  
investigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every  
continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to  
get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted  
in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being  
as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the  
estate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the  
deceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to  
supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results  
of the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I  
have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known  
or identifiable family member.

This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the  
prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late  
beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by  
the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of  
claim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most  
probably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the  
money entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be  
out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department.  
This will not happen if I have my way.

What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice  
but I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the  
banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world  
aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with  
huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain  
portfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general  
direction of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I  
alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no  
one unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of  
this deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the  
transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds  
to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are  
just customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single  
idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply  
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes  
forward, and this is the situation.

This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family  
of the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no  
family but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  
I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm  
to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon  
receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in  
half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of  
kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the  
proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to  
me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement  
in claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent  
foreigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to  
claim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a  
few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the  
file relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with  
the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you;  
with these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to  
have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account  
holder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving  
the money from the firm.

We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the  
consequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest  
in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that  
you do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal  
to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please  
not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You  
may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of  
comparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a  
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this  
may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry

Strictly Confidential  & Urgent Business Proposal.

Re: Transfer Of Usd $21,500.000{Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Us Dollars Only.

I am a member of the Federal Government Of  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (N.N.P.C).
Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Petroleum Trust Fund (P.T.F.) BY MY COMMITTEE.

This contract was over invoiced to the tune of us$ 21.5Million Dollars. This was done delibrately. The over - invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.

We not want to transfer this money, which is in a suspense account with the P.T.F. into any oversea account, which we expect you to provide for us.

Share:

60 % of the money would be for my partners and I.
30 % of the money would be yours, for providing us with logistics, which, would include a safe bank account, where we shall facilitate funds transfer into, as soon as documentations are concluded over here.
10 % of the money has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the course of the transaction, (both local and international expenses).

If interested in assisting us, please contact me via my secured email address, as soon as possible (uba.jega3@caramail.com) or my secured satellite tel/fax number, specially procured for this project.

It may interest you to know that a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, President of Crane International Trading Corp., of 153 East 57th St., 28th floor, N.Y.10022, Telephone: 212-308-7788 and Telex: 6731689. The deal was concluded and all covering documents, forwarded to Mr. Miller to authenticate the claims. Once the funds were transferred, Mr. Miller presented to his bank, all the legal documents and remitted the whole funds to another bank account, and disappeared completely. My colleagues and I were shattered, since such opportunities are not easy to come by.

Please, if you are interested in assisting us carry out to the fullest capacity, this transaction, we would require the following information from you which would enable us make formal application to the various ministries / parastatals, for the release and onward transfer of the money to your account.

1.Your Full Name, Company's Name, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers.
2.Your Bank Name, Address. Telephone and Fax Number.
3.Your Bank Account Number and Beneficiary Name - You must be the signatory.

Please, note that we have strong and reliable connections at the Central Bank Of Nigeria and other Government Parastatals, hence assistance in this regards, would not be a problem.
At the conclusion of this transaction, we shall use same contacts to withdraw all documents used in the course of this, to avoid any trace whatsoever that may ever arise, to you or to us, now and in the nearest possible future.

It might also interest you to know that we are mere civil servants who do not want to miss this opportunity, hence, we want this money transferred out, as soon as possible, before the newly democratically elected government ever think of making enquiries as regards the various activities of the past military government.

Kindly contact me as soon as possible, whether or not you are interested in this deal, so that whereby you are not interested, it would give us more room to scout for another partner. But if you are interested, kindly contact me via above email, telephone or fax, so that we can swing into action, as time is not on our part.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours Faithfully,

Dr. Uba Jega.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal, though we had never meant in person but I got your contact from the Personal Assistance to the former Minister for Sports, more so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in such business but you are in a better position to handle the transaction/business of this magnitude without you running away with our own share of fund once your account is credited within 8 working days because before I commence we have to build mutual relationship in respect of this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal /essential documents to back up this transaction are in place. The key for us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both parties involved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contract payment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I truly apologize for using this means to reach you for I have no other choice. Within the South African Football Association and the cooperation of my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totaling Thirty Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$38.5M). With your assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague beg you to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presently lying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It does matter whether it is a corporate or personal account but as long as the account is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very ok to us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operate offshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important towards the successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall both benefits from. This US$38.5M arose from the balance of the total contract value for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg and Soweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it was awarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president Mr Nelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately, though the actual contract cost have been fully paid to the original contractor. 

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us (which I prayed and beg for) in the transaction; your share of the sum will be 25% of the total amount after Tax in any account you shall provide for the funds to be transferred into, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistance we shall invest in property management/real estate business in your country. And that is why we offered you 25% of the total amount not just to receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred to your account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life I have been a civil servant.

Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel and Fax number or my e-mail address: (DSolow@latinmail.com) if you are willing to help in this matter and I also want to guarantee you that my partner and myself are in a better position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your earliest response.

villaran nenita <villaran_nenitaonline@hotmail.com>,,"Thu, 19 Jan 2006 08:35:44 +0000",Urgent Message From Mrs.Villaran Mario Nenita ,"Dearest in the Lord,

Greetings to you and your family, I am Mrs VILLARAN NENITA, from 
Philippines. I am married to Mr. MARIO NENITA who worked with Philippines 
embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002.He is 
also a well known fruits import and Export business man in Ivory Coast. We 
were married for eleven years without a child.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his 
death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to 
remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is 
against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.6Million 
US dollars with a bank in Ivory Coast Presently, this money is still in the 
custody of the bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for 
the next three months due to cancer problem.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or 
better to a Christian individual or a good Muslim personality that have a 
humanity understanding and trustworthy that will utilize this money the way 
I am going to instruct herein. I want a church or an individual personality 
that  is trustworthy  to use this money for orphanages, widows, propagating 
the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is maintained. The 
Bible made us to understand that ""Blessed is the hand that giveth"". I took 
this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money 
and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's 
efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money 
will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am 
not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to 
be in the bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the Lord will fight 
my case and I shall hold my peace"". I don't need any telephone communication 
in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's 
relatives around me always.

I don't want them to know about this development as I am convinced that With 
God by my said, all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I 
shall give you the contact of the bank in Ivory Coast, I will also send a 
copy of my passport to you and my photo and also issue you an authority 
letter that will empower you to be the beneficiary of the money. I want you 
and your church to always pray for me because the Lord is my shepherd and he 
shall see us through, My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy 
Christian so I have no fear at all for I am convinced that God is with me 
and he shall be with you if you make yourself available to take up this 
spiritual project of God.

I believe that whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit 
and Truth thus I took this decision. Please always be prayerful all through 
your life. Contact me on this email address always and please be informed 
that any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person 
for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I 
Stated herein.

Hoping to receive your reply.
Remain blessed in the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
MRS VILLARAN NENITA

JOHN KOROVO FROM GERMANY, THE LATE WELL KNOWN BUSINESS MAN, WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY IN JULY 25 2000 IN A SUPER SONIC CONCORD PLANE CRASH AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE. 

MY CLIENT WAS HAVING AN ABANDON SUM OF THIRTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS ($30.5M USD) WITH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OF BURKINA FASO. 

THE FACT AND CONFIDENTIALLY, THIS SUM KEPT HERE VERY SECRET WHILE NOBODY KNOWS EXCEPT HIS WIFE, AS HE WAS A GOOD BUSINESS MAN, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, SO HE KEPT THIS MONEY HERE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. UNFORTUNATELY HE LOST HIS LIVE WITH HIS FAMILY IN THE EVENT OF THE PLANE CRASH, SINCE THEN I HAVE MADE SEVERAL ENQUIRIES TO LOCATE ANY OF MY CLIENT RELATIVES BUT ALL MY EFFORTS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  
  
ABOVE ALL, SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND I DON'T WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANKS TREASURY AS AN UNCLAIMED BILL. BECAUSE THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATED THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED UNCLAIMED AFTER FIVE (5) YEARS THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND. 
THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A BURKINABE CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER.
 
AFTER ALL THESE, I DECIDED TO TRACE HIS RELATIVES OVER THE INTERNET AND ALSO TRAVELLED TO GERMANY, TO LOCATE ANY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY BUT OF NO AVAIL, HENCE I CONTACTED YOU TO ASSIST ME IN REPATRIATING THE BALANCE OF LATE MR. JOHN KOROVO LEFT BEHIND TO YOU AS HIS REAL NEXT OF KIN.

Email-(jerrymahmed@regards.net)


                        BUSINESS PROPOSAL


 My name is DR.JERRY M AHMED   a member of the 
Presidential Task Force on
Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last yearthere was a
major oil spillage in
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over
70% of the
communities homeless.The contract was handled by a
foreign firm but
because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged, we
decided to
over-invoice the contract
sum. Now the contract has been completed and the
original contractor has
since been paid,but the contract balance of US$31.50
million(THIRTY-ONE
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES
DOLLARS),which resulted from
the over invoiced contract sum that has been left in a
suspense account
with the CENTRAL BANK of NIGERIA,is what me and my
partners are planning
to take out of the country for ourselves.The problem
is as government
officials,we are not suppose to own fat bank
accounts,talk less of having
foreign ones.

To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a
foreign partner who
can assist us and receive this amount into your
account. We are ready to
share this money with you on the basis of
participation. We also have
plans to invest part of this money in any viable
business in your country
under your care,as we are nearing our retirement age.

In any case, I received a reference of
you/organization from the Nigeria
Chambers of Commerce and Industry 'Foreign Trade
Division' as a reputable
organ that can assist us on this transaction. Please
if you accept my
proposal do not hesitate to send me a send me an
e-mail  so that I can
provide you with the basic procedures for the release
of the fund.

It does not matter whether you or your company does
contract project of
the nature described here, the assumption is that you
won a major contract
and subcontracted it to another company, more often
thannot, big trading
companies or individuals of unrelated field win major
contracts here in
Nigeria and subcontracts same to more specialized
firms for execution.

 BENEFIT: For providing the account where we shall
remit this money, you
will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% will
be for me and my
partners,while 5% has been set aside to cover any
expenses that may be
incurred by both parties during this transaction, both
local and
international.

 Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with
utmost degree of
maturity and confidentiality because I am still in
active government
service with the""NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM
CORPORATION"". If I receive
your response on time, this whole transaction could be
accomplished within
the shortest possible time based on your interest and
determination,since the money is already in transit.

Awaiting your urgent response and thanks for your
anticipated co operation

Yours faithfully,

Dr.JERRY M AHMED

DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME 
ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON MR.ANDREAS 
SCHRANNER WHO WHO DIED WITH HIS WIFE AND THEIR ONLY DAUGHTER ON JULY 2000 IN 
A PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK 
WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR 
RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT.

THE SAID AMOUNT WAS U.S $10.150M ((TEN MILLION ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTYTHOUSAND

COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF

REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN 
WITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN

Yetunde Bassey <yet_bassey@123.com>,yet_bassey@123.com,,PROJECT INTEREST.,"

My dear friend, 

I am Mr. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger Scott made died from an 
automobile accident. 

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Scott made did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Scott  so that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

Mr. Yetunde Bassey

,h00o17@yahoo.com,,{BUSINESS PROPOSAL} ,"
Dear Sir,

My name is Hartman Onowu,I am the operational manager
in account management section incharge of credit and
foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South
Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer
of my bank who perished with his whole families on
25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ]
with the whole passengers aboard.

There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by
this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a
written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since
his death , I personally has watched with keen
interest to see the next of kin but all has proved
abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no
other person knows about this account or anything
concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and
until his death he was the manager of his company.

The total amount involved is 16,000,000.00
USD.[Sixteen Million United States Dollar ]. We wish
to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Six
million] and open successful transaction without any
disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for
the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.
I have secretly discussed this matter with the general
manager of the bank who I must involve in order to
have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to
any foreign bank account which you are going to
nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a
reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign
beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing
his/her bank account where the fund will be
transferred for immediate investment on any viable
project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to
stay more than six years without claim hence the money
will be recalled to the government treasury as
unclaimed after this long period of domancy. In view
of this I got your contact through my personal search
to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank
account for the transfer or find a reliable person who
will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her
personal account.

At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fund
will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total
transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in
your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside
to settle expenses both parties might incure during
the transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply,
I will send to you a detailed information about the
transaction.I will not fail to bring to your notice
that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and
that you should not entertain any fear as all
modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7
to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the
beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.

When you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mail
or you can call me or fax me. You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe
communication.

TEL:870-763-648313
   :870-763-648314.
FAX:870-763-648315.  

Respectfully yours,
Hartman Onowu.

EMAIL:request_clark2006@yahoo.fr

Dear Friend.
May almighty God bless you. I am Rev. Fr. Peter Clark, a senior staff with the UN special duties office ;my office monitors and controls the affairs of all banks and financial institutions. I have before me list of funds, which could not be transferred to some nominated accounts as these accounts have been identified either as ghost accounts, unclaimed deposits or over-invoiced sum etc. I have the opportunity to write you based on the instructions among others i received days ago from the officer in the computer section in person of Engineer Peter Cliff,to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LM-05-371) amounting US$10 million.The (Ten Million Dollars) is arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get the box shipped to you.

A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday. As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. Also we found out that some of the officials of the parastatals have been extorting money from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers.I am the final signatory to any transfer or remittance of huge funds moving within banks both on the local and international levels.

A friend of mine who is a diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialised in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another, with diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world unlike Dhl, Ems, FedEx and Ups because, they will have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment. I have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them, which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat will bring the consignment to you, he has been in this line of work for many years now ;so you have notting to worry about.

I am conditionally prepared to assist you get the money, practically after studying the part leading to this particular stage in the payment process in connivance with your local collaborators to conceal the authentic source of the funds.And my only condition for this unusual assistance is after all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500,000.00) to any charity organisation I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect, you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by courier. 

Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not inform anyone about this until you received your money. When you conclude this we will help to ship the final part of your money to you.

Yours Faithfully,

I am Mr. John mensah Sulikuh, a supervisory manager at the United Trust Bank  Ltd,London. However I got your contact through the International web  directory.Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge Amount of Money  ValuedUSD17, 600,000.00 (Seventeen Million, six hundred Dollars Only) that  belongs to One of our late Customer MR. KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS. who died In a  plane crash. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my Department came Across a very huge sum of money belonging to MR. KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS from Beverwijk, Netherlands, who died along with his wife, MRS. KATRIEN DIONIJS and Daughter, MS. SOFIE DIONIJS so the fund has Been dormant in his account with this Bank without Any claim of the fund in our custody either from his Family or relation before Our discovery to this development. The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for 15 years, it will be forfeited to the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed bill. It is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund.In order to avert this negative development. On behalf of my trusted colleagues we now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and  paid into your account as the beneficiary�s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased, MR. KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS.  We could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose. However, on smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% as gratification for your assistance to us, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses on both sides that may arise during the time of transfer and also for telephone bills, and the remaining 70% will be for me and my colleague. What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free. Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish. For confidentiality please contact me on my personal email account:sulikuh_john@rediffmail.com and sulikuh_john@ourwest.com  Best Regards, Mr. John Mensah Sulikuh United Trust Bank Ltd",0,1

FROM.Mr.Ishmila Sani,
Personal Assistant to,
President Charles Taylor(ex)
Date;28th march,2007.

Dear sir/madam,

I personally decided to put in writing as below, the full details of
this business proposal that I have been trying to explain to you. I have
a re-profiling amount in an excess of US$50M,(Fifty Million USD) which I
seek your
partnership in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this
total sum to you for your quick assistance and partnership, 70% for me and
while 5% should be set side for reimbursement of any unforeseen
expenses we both might incure in the cause of this transaction. However, I
sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I am proposing
to you.

My name is Ishmila Sani, I am the personal assistance to the former President
of Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles
Taylor decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a
neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum. Based on these developments, his
various foreign bank accounts have been frozen and some are still under
serious investigation. But in the light of all these happenings,
President Charles Taylor was able, through the help of some loyalist
succeeded
to secretly move the sum of US$50M, on my name as the owner to a
private security company vault where the final crediting is expected to be
carried out later, but recently he has just been arrested and taken
away. You can read more on CNN news of March 30, 2006.
http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/03/29/taylor.nigeria/index.html

All the depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they
are still in my possession, What I need from you is to stand as the
beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the
documentation which will enable the Security Company transfer / wire the
fund to
your bank account. I have decided to do this only with you and use this
sum to relocate to European, American or Asia continent and never to be
connected to any of President Charles Taylor's conglomerates. This
transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks.
My questions are:-
1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?
3. can you keep this business as very confidential?
4. If you can sponsor this transfer, Is 25% acceptable to you, as your
commission?

Consider this and reach me on my private email above, for more discussion,
so I can
give you more clear explanations details and information about this
transaction. I will also need your direct telephone and fax number for
easy communication. Finally, it is my humble prayer that the information as
contained herein is accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the
secrecy it deserves. Please I need you to send me your telephone number
so I can give you a call immediately for more discussion. As soon as I
get your positive response, I will send you more information to you.

Kinder regards,

(STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL)
FROM THE DESK OF ( MR. YSOUF AROUNA)
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT /FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BF
REQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't
know me in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your
impressive information through an international business equiry .

But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it
will open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us.
This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of
your business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair
for profitable business is needed .

Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of
auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an
abandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in
november 2002 in a plane crash.

Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his
next of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation
to the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but
unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation
died alongside
with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my
department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and
I don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed
Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money
remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered
into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is
occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,
inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set
aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for
me . There after I will visit your country with my family for
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of
kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account
number,
your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective
communication and location where in the money will be remitted .

On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or
by email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide
materials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment
formalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official
protocols here and expect you to undertake international
responsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction
provided you display maturity.

Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my
email address .

Thanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.

Yours sincerely.

From Richard Ohene, Before I introduce myself, I  wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you  to treat it with seriousness. This letter must come to you as a big  surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become  great friends and business partners.  My name is Richard Ohene, the  present branch Manager of a bank here in Ghana. I write you this  proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the  information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have a  transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is  required as a foreigner.  I use to head the Accounts department in my  bank head office, but last December I was asked to take position of a  Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became  the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I  discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has  not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I  found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. ANDREAS SCHRANNER a  German great industrialist and a resident of Munich, who unfortunately  lost his life along with his entire famillies in the plane crash of  CONCORDE AIRLINE [Flight AF4590 ] which crashed on 25TH JULY, 2000. You  shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site, which I got  during my investigation; .  The account is escrow call account,  a secret type of account in my bank and no other person knows about  this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other  beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then  and nobody has come forward to ask about the money as next of kin to  the late Mr. Andreas Schranner, meaning that no one is aware of the  account. I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a  foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to  claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch,  I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner  that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct  information concerning the account, which I shall give you. I am  seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the  account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.  There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed  under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of  law.  Thanking you in advance and may God bless, Richard Ohene",1,1

inflated sum, due to our position  as civil servants 
and members of this panel, we cannot aquire this money 
in our names. 
I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust 
by my colleagues of the panel to look for an oversea 
partner into whose account the sum of us$31,000 000,00 
(thirty-one million united states dollars) will be 
Paid by telegraphic transfer. Hence we are writting 
you this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 
1.  70% for us (the officials) 
2.  20% for the foreign patner(you) 
3.  10% to be used in settling taxation and local and 
Foreign expenses. 

It is this 70% that we wish to commence the 
importation business and the investment abroad. Please 
note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope 
that the funds can arrive your account in latest 
ten(10) banking days from the date of reciept of the 
following information.A suitable company name and bank 
account(company or personel) into which the funds can 
be paid. 
   
The above information will enable us write letters 
of claim and job  description respectively. This way 
we will use your company's name to apply for payments 
and re-award the contract to your company name. 
   
We are looking foward to doing business with you and 
solicit your confidentiality  in this transaction.

relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of Fifty-five
Million United States Dollars ($55,000,000,00) cash,
which I intend to use for investment purposes
specifically in your country. This money came as a
result of a pay-back contract deal between my late
husband and a Russian firm in our country�s
Multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant. The Russian
partners returned my Husband�s share of
US$55,000,000.00 U.S.D after his death, and lodged it
in my late husband�s Security company of which I am a
Director Right now, the new Civilian Government has
intensified their probe on my late Husband�s Financial
resources and have frozen our accounts. In view of
these facts, I acted fast to withdraw the
US$55,000,000.00 U.S.D from the company�s vault and
deposited it in a privately owned security safe in my
village. I have since declared the security company
bankrupt. No record whatsoever exists concerning the
money traceable by the Government because, there is no
documentation showing that we received the money from
the Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning
the Government�s attitude towards my husband, it has
become quite impossible for me to make use of this
money within; thus upon consent, I shall expect you to
contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail
about this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to
transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 10% (ten
percent) of the total sum to you for the expected
services and assistance. Your urgent response is
highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this
opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily
confidential, whatever your decision, while I await
your prompt response.
Send your phone nos for easier communication.

Best regards

Rep Of South Africa. 


Dear Sir/Madam, 

I am Mr.D Dumas. a consulting auditor of prime banks here
in South  Africa. I have the courage to Crave indulgence
for this important  business believing that you will never
let me down either now or in the  future.


Some year ago, an American Mining consultant/ contractor
with the South African Mining corporation, made a numbered
time (fixed)deposit for   twelve calendar months, valued
$142M.USD (ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO   MILLION US DOLLARS)
in an account. On maturity, The bank sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, The bank sent another reminder and finally
his contract employers, the South African Mining
corporation wrote to inform the bank that he died without
MAKING A WILL, and all attempts by the American Embassy to
trace  his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore, made
further investigation  and discovered that the beneficiary
was an immigrant from Jamaica and only  recently obtained
American citizenship. He did not declare any kin or
 relations in all his official documents, including his
Bank deposit paper work. 

This money total amount$142M.USD (ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO
MILLION US DOLLARS)is still sitting in my bank as dormant
Account.No one will ever come forward to claim it, and
according to South African banking  policy, after some
years, the money will revert to the ownership of the  South
African Government if the account owner is certified dead.
This is  the situation, and my proposal is that I am
looking for a foreigner who  will stand in as the next of
kin to beneficiary, and OPEN a Bank Account  abroad to
facilitate the transfer of this money.This is simple, all
you  have to do is to OPEN an account anywhere in the world
and send me its  detail for me to arrange the proper money
transfer paperwork, and  facilitate the transfer.The money
will then be paid into this Account for us  to share in the
ratio of 60% for me, 30 % for you and 10% for expenses
 that might come up during transfer process. There is no
risk at all, and  all the paper work for this transaction
will be done by me using my  position and connections in
the banks in South Africa.

This business transaction is guaranteed.And the first phase
of the transfer will be ($42M.USD)  FORTY TWO MILLION
DOLLARS as advised by our insider in the bank.If you are
interested, please reply immediately through my personal
email sending the following details:

Mr. Lawrence Abba <lawrenceabba@operamail.com>,R@M,"Sat, 01 Feb 2003 17:20:51 -0800",FOREIGN PARTNER,"Dear, 

Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, I am Mr. Lawrence Abba, a Zimbabwean Farmer. 

I am contacting you as the need to for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country Zimbabwe, does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not insured, just as reported by international media.  I got your contacts through personal research and out of desperation I decided to reach you through this medium. I will give you more information as regards to this as soon as you reply and I repose great confidence in you hence my approach due to security network place on us and I hope you will not let me out to security personal.

This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a degree on May 31st 2000 to seize more than 849 white-owned farms.  So far, more than 1,400 white owned farms have been invaded and confiscated, as well as claiming the properties of the farmers. Consequently, most of my colleagues and our properties were seized again putting us to total confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the administration of President Mugabe in my country and we where subjected to psychological torture by the security agents in the country. Some of my friends are still under detention, although arrangements are being made for their release, now I have no confidence with anybody within my country.

During these periods, as reported by some international media including the CNN, so many white farmers were killed, the government is not stopping at this, as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country Zimbabwe for so many years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. Therefore, I decided to contact you, for your assistance, so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I am a foreigner.

For this purpose, I have put in a security deposit all monies from the sale of my farm and farming equipments (including tractors etc) which amounted to US$6.5Million, I had to move the money out of the country through a very secret arranged channel in a very unconventional method by my friend an official at the ""Security Minting  & Printing Company"" of my country.  Presently, the money is in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm whose name is withheld for now until we open communication.  

I will upon receiving your consent prepare every document to enable you receive this money on my behalf, pending my arrival to meet with you in your country so that we can both make further arrangements with regards to establishing the company.

As a partner you will be entitled to 20% stake in whichever company that you both decide to establish when I arrive your country.

I am waiting urgently for your response and please treat with utmost confidentiality.

Best Regards 


Lawrence Abba.

  (""REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS
              CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE"")

Compliment Of The Season, 

On a very good day. I am (Joe Kekabu Esq),the Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. 

 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. 

You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. 
Yours faithfully, 

Joe Kekabu (Esq.)

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.

            {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)

    (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)
     ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS 

Dear sir/madam,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00USD) One hundred and 
Fifty two million United StatesDollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask 
you to quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable  
and fit to provide either an existing bank account  or  to set up a new  
Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to 
receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for 
this important business trusting in  you and believing  in God that you will 
never let me down either now or in future.
I am MR SOLOMON MUDANI, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during 
the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account 
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account 
again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the 
owner of the account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is floating and 
if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for 
nothing.
The owner of this account is  Mr.  Arthur Coleman , a foreigner, and an 
Industrialist, who died since 1993 and  no other person knows about this account or 
anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my 
investigation proved to me as well that Arthur Coleman until his death was the 
manager of Coleman Coy.(pty). SA. We will start the  first transfer with fifty 
twomillion [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction without any 
disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining 
amount to your account.The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and Fifty two million 
United States Dollars only. I want to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two 
million United States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners account 
abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting 
you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person 
here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved 
to a foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and 
foreign a/c  because the money is in US DOLLARS and the former owner of the  
a/c  Mr. Arthur Coleman is a foreigner too, [and the money canonly be approved into a foreign a/c. However, we will sign a binding 
agreement, to bind us together.  I got your contact address  from my Secretary who 
operates computer. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will 
never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person 
that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I 
will inform you on the next step to take urgently. Send also your private 
telephone and fax numbers including the full details of the account to be used 
for the deposit.
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding 
agreement that will  bind us together  before transferring the money to any 
account of  your choice  where the fund will be safe before we fly to your 
country for withdrawal, sharing and investments. I need your full co-operation 
to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve thispayment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, 
which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced 
that you are  capable  and will meet up with instructions of a key bank 
official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong 
assurance that you will never,never let me down. With my influence and the 
position of the bank official, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's 
reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be 
intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank 
official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this 
money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence  you can come 
immediately  to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this 
remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two 
days ahead of the money going into the account.
I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you 
that you are ready to actand receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and 
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward transfer of this money to 
your account with appropriate clearance from  the relevant ministries and 
foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business, you will be 
given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for 
expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transfering.

I look forward to your earliest reply solomonmudani_22@yahoo.com.

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet
your personal Ethics. I introduce myself as Mr. Andrew Gama staff in
the accounts management Section of a well-known bank in South Africa.

One of our accounts with holding balance of �15,000,000
(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and last operated in
the past 3 years. From my investigations and confirmations, the owner
of this account is a Foreigner by name Gerald Stone died on the 4th of
January 2002 on a planecrash in Birmingham UK.

Since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money as he
has no family Member who is aware of the existence of either the
accountn or the Funds.Information from the National Immigration also
states that he was single on entry into South Africa.

I have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and
we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We
thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of
these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due
processes have been followed.

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is Legitimate and
does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other Illegal act. 

On your interest, let me hear from you.

any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved 
unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track 
his 
last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I 
contacted you.I have contacted you to assist in repartrating the fund 
valued at US$13 million Left behind by my client before it gets 
Confisicated or declared unserviceable by the Security Finance Firm where this 
huge amount were deposited.

locating the relatives for over 3 years now, I seek the consent to present 
you as the next of kin to the deceased,since you have the same last 
name with my client,so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to 
you.

require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this 
transaction through.

http://www.s-t.com/daily/11-99/11-02-99/d08ho174.htm
Since we got this  information about his death.

On further investigation, I found out that he  died
without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that  Mr.Raymond Beck did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official 
documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my
Bank. 

This sum of  US$18,000,000.00 is still sitting
in my Bank and the interest is being  rolled over with
the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever  come forward to claim it.     According to Laws
of Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five)
years, the money will revert to the ownership of  the
Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the
fund. The Senior  Executive Vice President
Mr.Sheng-Yih Hu  willing to give it to the 
government to have is own cut too, You can check the
site ://www.icbc.com.tw/  Quick Menu About ICBC Senior
Management Profiles so that you know this person.
Consequently.

My proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in  as the next of kin to
Mr.Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this old man's 
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt
government officials. This  is simple, I will like you
to provide immediately your full names and  address so
that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and  affidavits that will put you in place as the next
of kin.

We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and
notarization of the WILL and to  obtain the necessary
documents and letter of probate/administration in your
favor for the transfer A bank account in any part of
the world that you will  provide will then facilitate
the transfer of this money to you as the 
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into
your account for us to  share in the ratio of 80% for
me and 20% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be  done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager Guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.

Dear Friend,

Please do not be disturbed about this mail as I am
contacting you for the first time through this medium, 
while nursing no doubts that you will be of great 
assistance to this business proposal  I am about 
disclosing to you for our both mutual benefit.


I am Dr. Ken Dikko, the Project Director of
Nitel at the above address.

Following my intentions of owning an offshore
investment, I was urged to  contact a foreigner 
to assist in facilitating the  immediate release 
of $14Million United States Dollars into his/her bank
account to jointly execute my motive of securing 
an offshore  investment. This was because Nigeria's 
civil service code of conduct does  not allow a civil 
servant to own an offshore account or investment
outside the shores of Nigeria.

Sequel to this, I was able to contact a foreigner (Mr.
Jim Walsh) an American based in Nigeria to assist 
with the transfer.  He agreed and we  proceeded 
in procuring all documents necessary to  facilitate the 
immediate release of the funds into his custody using
him as a Project Consultant to the Nigerian 
Telecommunication.

The money was as a result of an over-invoiced contract
on contract  number ""ntl-fgn01/ped-98"" for the 
procurement, supply  and installation of 
Telecommunication equipment to Nitel regional offices
up to the tune of $52Million United States Dollars. 
It was awarded to a  Swiss Contractor who executed 
the contract and was fully paid i.e $38Million United 
States Dollars leaving aside $14Million United States
Dollars.

Final payment approval was granted on behalf of Mr.
Jim Walsh by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) 
to the paying bank while waiting for the payment 
application from him to the bank but he
suddenly died of Cardiac Arrest leaving no 
Next of kin/beneficiary to the funds.

It is as a result of this, that I am contacting 
you to  please stand as the next of kin to Mr. 
Jim Walsh and new beneficiary  to the funds to 
enable the funds to be transfered into your custody.
All documents to back up your claim will be giving 
to you adequately  while a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) will be reached between us to safe
guard our both interest in line of this transaction.

I am willing to compensate you with 25% of the total
funds while the rest 75% will be for me for the 
investments in your country as well as assuring 
you that this transaction is 100% risk free
and legal.

If this proposal is okay to you, please kindly get
back to me to enable  me demand certain informations 
and briefing for the commencement of this transaction.

Please always quote the reference number above in all
correspondences to me while confidentiality should be 
our watch word.

I await your urgent response.

Sincere regards,

Dr. Ken Dikko.

Project Director,
Nitel.

17/F DEVCON HOUSE
979 KING'S ROAD
HONG KONG.

Dear Friend,


I am Joseph Wong, credit officer of Bank of America (Asia) Ltd, Hong Kong.


I  have an urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you.


On october 6, 2001, an American Engineer/Consultant with  the Chinese
Solid  Minerals Corporation,Mr. Steinmetz Horst made a (Fixed) Deposit for
twelve calendar months, valued at US$40,500,000.00 (Forty Million  Five
Hundred thousand United State Dollars only) in my branch.


Upon maturity,I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address but
got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the  Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation
that Mr. Steinmetz Horst died from a recurrent heart disease.


On further investigation,I found out that he died  without making  a will,
and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.


I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. Steinmetz
Horst did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  official
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.


This sum of US$40,500,000.00 is still lingering in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.


According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign and defense
affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five) years,such funds will revert to the
ownership of the chinese Government for financing military operations,such
as purchasing of arms and ammunitions for the military.


In order to avert this negative development,i will like to seek for your
permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Steinmetz
Horst so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for
financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the
world in general.


The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of
60% for me and 30% for you and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of
the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for this
project will be done by my attorney and with my position as the credit
officer guarantees the successful execution of this project. If you are
interested,please reply immediately.


Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and that
will help you understand the transaction.


You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured  that this 
project would be most profitable for both parties because I shall require
your assistance to invest my share in your country.


Awaiting your urgent reply.


Thanks and regards.


Mr. Joseph Wong.

Assalamo Alaikum,

Wasalaam to you,and how are you doing?. My intention of contacting you is to solicit your assistance for a project,  which will be mutually beneficial. Though I know my decision to contact you is to a large extent unconventional, the  prevailing circumstances necessitated my action. I am Haleema  Hamza from Libya. I am married to Late Mallam Mustafa Hamza of blessed memory was an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the year 2000. We were married  for twelve years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he made a huge deposit in millions of US dollars with a Deposit Company in oversea. (I will tell you the amount as we proceed).

Recently, my doctor told me that I have only few months to live due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. My parents died at a tender age and i was brought up in the orphanage through the help of a devouted muslim.I want this Muslim organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund mosques,  orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran.

The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged me to take the bold step. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are into some radical Organizations and I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for this 
bold decision, I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most beneficent and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply on Email:hhamza@cooltoad.com, I shall give you the contact information of the Deposit Company in oversea where the money was deposited. I will also issue a letter of authority to the Deposit Company authorizing them that the said fund have being willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims worthy of emulation, Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness. I will not stipulate any precise amount to reward you, as it will have to be on pre-negotiated terms, based on your level of involvement. 
Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give room in sourcing for a Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim for this same purpose. Until I hear from you by email, my dreams will rest squarely on your Shoulders. May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and  protect you.

Dear sir/madam 

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00USD) One hundred and 
Fifty two million United StatesDollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to 
ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be 
capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new

receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for 
this important business trusting in you and believing in God that you will 
never let me down either now or in future. 
I am MR solomon mudani, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during 
the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account 
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this 
account again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered 
that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is 
floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for 
nothing. 
The owner of this account is Mr. Arthur Coleman , a foreigner, and an 
Industrialist, who died since 1993 and no other person knows about this 
account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my 
investigation proved to me as well that Arthur Coleman until his death was the 
manager of Coleman Coy.(pty). SA. We will start the first transfer with fifty 
two million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction without any 
disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining 
amount to your account.
The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and Fifty two million 
United States Dollars only. I want to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty 
two million United States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners 
account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only 
contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local 
person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be 
approved to a foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and 
foreign a/c because the money is in US DOLLARS and the former owner of the a/c 
Mr. Arthur Coleman is a foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c. However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind 
us together. I got your contact address from my Secretary who operates

on the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and

deposit. 
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding 
agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account 
of your choice where the fund will be safe before we fly to your country 
for withdrawal, sharing and investments. I need your full co-operation to 
make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment 
to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will 
give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are capable and will meet up with instructions of a key bank official who 
is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance 
that you will never,never let me down. With my influence and the position of 
the bank official, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be 
intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank 
official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this

DR.ERIC MORGAN

ABIDJAN,

COTE D' IVOIRE 


Dearest Beloved,


I am Dr.Eric Morgan an account officer with Banque Internationale de L' afrique De L' Ouest Cote D' Ivoire. I am writing following an opportunity in my department here in the bank that will be of immense benefit to both of us. 


In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10 million Ten million united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer the Late Mr Smith B.Andrea an American oil engineer with Petro Technical Services Sarl who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife. 


You read more on the crash on visiting this Site.http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska. airlines.list/smith.html.


Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.


Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his wife [Patty Andrea] died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. 


It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. 


The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained after six and half years, the money will then be transferred into Government treasury as unclaimed funds. 


I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as the foreign partner, while the balance will be for me. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. 


Please be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction. Note this transaction is confidential and risk free.


As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail.Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to your yet to be provided account has been finalised. 


We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response. Please in your response include your telephone number for easy communication between us.


Best Regards,

Dr Eric Morgan.

Bill Franklyn <cnslntnt_bfranklyn@msn.com>,,"Mon, 26 Sep 2005 20:01:39 +0000",I AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE.,"Dear Friend,


I am Bill Franklyn,a Financial Consultant Account portfolio manager based 
and working in London UK, working in one of the leading finance houses and I 
happen to have managed a particular  account for a Resident Foreigner,here 
in the United Kingdom,who died Interstate, leaving in our care a sizeable 
amount in a domiciliary United States Dollars Investment Account.

For some reasons this client does not have an easily identifiable next of 
Kin and I have made several enquiries to locate any of my clients relatives; 
immediate and extended, this has proved unsuccessful, hence  I am contacting 
you ""based on the fact that you have similar names"". I need your assistance 
in securing the money and property left behind by my client before they get 
confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance House here in the 
United Kingdom. The Finance House has already issued a Government Mandatory 
formality notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated 
and this should expire within a month.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives for over two 
years and convinced that no one is coming up and having satisfied the 
mandatory  legal requirement of Beneficiary next of kin Notification, I now 
seek a Reliable and Trustworthy person,with your consent and perfect 
understanding, to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the 
proceeds of this account initially valued at Twenty One Million, Three 
Hundred And Twenty Thousand United States Dollars,($21,320,000) interest not 
inclusive, can be paid into an account to be provided by you(preferably) 
outside the United Kingdom Financial Institutions or its Isles), as the

I am Mr Henry Kabore manager audit account department of African Development Bank(A.D.B.) .
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of NINTEEN MILLION, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($19,300,000.00 ) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in an aeroplane crash.
Since the bank got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the fund unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
And our banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, such money will be moved into the banking treasurer as unclaimed fund. 
 
The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner a citizen  Burkina Faso cannot stand as next of kin.
If you accept my proposal to do this deal to the end i will give to you 30% of the total money will be for you as a foreign partner while 10% will be set aside to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the process of transferring the fund to your nominated bank account. 
 
If you're willing to handle this deal with me kind get back to me with your Private telephone and fax numbers for easy communications well as your personal picture or a copy of your international passport to enable me know whom Im dealing with. 
 
Note: I demand the highest trust from you to keep this business strictly confidential for security reasons as you may know that the bank don't know that i am the one that contacted you to stand for this claim.
At the end of this transaction which will be when the money will hit your account safely i will then come over to your country for sharing the fund according to the previous agreed percentage, you might even have to advice me on possibilities of investment in your country.

I am expecting  your urgent reply so that i will send to you an  application form which you will fill and send  directly to the bank.
Best regards, 
Mr Henry Kabore

Dear Friend,
RE:REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF
THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN
DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.
I,on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of
Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards
the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This
fund arose from the overinvoicing of various contracts awarded in my
parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago. We as holders of
sensitive positions in our various parastatal, were mandated by the federal 
government
to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered
that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either
by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of
$33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a 
suspense account,
although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after 
executing
the said contracts.We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be
transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code 
of conduct of federal
civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we 
have
suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million
five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in united State of
America,but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms 
of
communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual 
agreement,
insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account 
before
disbursement will take effect.
We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount
US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your 
nominated bank
account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will
be compensated with 20% of of the amount for your assistance and services.
This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitive positions
we cannot afford a slip.
I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with
our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully
established and smooth operation commences. I am at your disposition to
entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so, contact
me immediately through the above email address for further information
on the requirements and procedure. Please note that this is a DEAL and
confidentiality is of very great importanceb for security reasons.
Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency.

FIRST BANK OF NIGERIA Plc. 

Marina,Lagos-Nigeria.



Dear Sir, 



I am Prince James Irabo. from the First Bank of 

Nigeria Plc,Lagos Branch.I got your contact through.the 

internet I have urgent and very confidential business 

proposal for you. On January 7, 1999, an America

Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National

Petroleum Corporation,Mr. Charles Ballassi made a numbered

time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at

US$9,700,000.00(Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand

Dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I sent a rountine

notification to his forwarding address but got no

reply.After a month,wesent a reminder and finally we

discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian 

National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Charles Ballassi 

died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian 

990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it 

yourself via the website below: 

http://www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html

on further investigation, i found out that he died without 

making a WILL, and attempts to trace his next of kin was 

fruitless.I therefore made further investigation

and discovered that Mr. Charles Ballassi did not declare

any next of kin or relations in all his official 

documents,including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum 

ofUS$9,700,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is 

being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of 

eachyear. No one will ever come forward to claim 

it.According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of 

(Six)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the

Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a 

foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles 

Ballassi so that the fruit of this old man's labour will 

not get into the hands of some corrupt Government 

officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide 

immediately yourfull name and address so that the Attorney will preparethe 

necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in 

place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of 

two attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL 

and obtain the ecessary documents and letter of

probate/administration in your favour for the transfer.Any 

bank account in any part of the world which you will 

provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to 

you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will

be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% 

for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all, the 

paperwork for this transaction will be done by the 

attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees 

the successful execution of ths transaction. If you are 

interested,please reply immediately via the private email 

address below,upon your responce,i shall provide you with 

more details and relevant documents that will help you 

understand the transaction. Please observe utmost 

confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction

would be most profitable for both of us because i shall

require your assitance to invest my share in your country. 

Please upon the reciept of this mail message, send to me 

the following to enable start the process of the fund into 

your bank account: 

1. Your full Name and address 

2. The name of your bank where you want the fund to be 

transferedinto, Account beneficiary 

3. Your private Telephone and fax numbers 



Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:ijames777@ny.com

cost of coming to the state and getting payments is very expensive,i am working on setting up a branch in the states,so for now i need a representative in the united states who will be handling the payment aspect.
  
It would'nt cost u any amount,This is no get rich quick scheme neither is it a scam or hoax in anyway.You are not required to pay any registration fee or pay for any application form before you get employed. Instead of paying for anything you will be receiving your weekly salary as soon as you get started. Too good to be true you will say.With your help i can reach and provide a better service to more people and businesses in American, faster and at a lower cost than my competitors.
      
My clients make payments for the products and services every week. 
They pay for my services in 3 major ways;
* Through Cheques
* Money orders or drafts( this forms of payment have been put on hold due to
some security reasons)
* Wire transfers
* Cash
 
Some of these forms of payment are not readily cashable or accepted in the Italy. This is the reason i need someone to work as my representative in the States and  asist me in processing the payments made to me by my clients.
 
You will receive as a weekly salary of 10% of whatever a client pays . Your job will be to receive this payment sent to me which will be sent to you via mail or courier service(if payment is a check,money order or draft) and cashing it at your bank or any designated cashing point.
 
If payment is in through wire transfer, i will require you to open a bank account to receive this payment.  I only  accept payment from clients that bank with the following banks stated below in America and Canada to make work more convenient for you.
1. Bank of America
2. Wells Fargo bank

Whatever the form of payment is you are to immediately deduct your weekly salary(10% of the money) and forward the balance to me  as you are instructed to do. Money will be sent to me by WESTERN UNION TRANSFER as this is a safe, secure, fast and reliable means of receiving money.
  So i would like to know if you would like to work online from home and getting paid weekly without leaving or affecting your present job?If you are interested,please get back to me as soon as possible.

Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5

and intergrity.

I got your contact in my search for a reputable and reliable person to

account belonging to an international businessman based here in benin 
republic who was involved in the December 25th Benin plane crash. I kept

jurisdiction to enable us submit claims and transfer this fund through 
trustworthy person whom we
shall present to our bank as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased.

Please visit
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html

Our investigations so far clearly reveals that there is no immediate 
survivor or even a relation to the deceased and as such,there is no 
immediate next of kin for further claims of the deceased fund as we have 
long been expecting someone to come forward with an applications. Further
informations /verifications from reliable sources too have confirmed that 
the deceased customer supposed next of kin were all in the plane with him 
died with him.

This fund is now ready for transfer into a foreign account, whose owner will 
be portrayed to our bank as the beneficiary and a next of kin to the 
deceased customer. The foreign account owner will
impost himself approprietly as the next of kin to the deceased and respond 
positively like a true next of kin who wishes to speed up the release and 
transfer process of his inherited fund.Kindly be aware too that if the 
over-due fund if not claimed by the end of next quarter, the National 
Treasury
and Bills of Benin will take over the ownership of the fund in line with the 
National Edict Act of 1979. We do not want this to happen as it will not 
augur to our best interest, having worked all our lives in the banking 
sector, that is why I contacted you for us to do the deal together with
absolute confidence, so that you will be portrayed as the bonafide 
beneficiary and an immediate next of kin to the deceased. I will give you 
further directives, advice and all needed informations required for this 
transaction as soon as I receive your positive response. Similarly,if you 
accept to carry out this transaction with us, we have resolved offering to 
you 30% of the total sum as
commission, extra 10% of all proceeds to be generated from subsequent 
profit-viable investments
projects and you will be compensated with an executive office in the 
project.The first-phase shall be a five (5) year irrevocable contractual 
business partnership. We will invest 50% of our shares into your firm if you 
already have one provided that is profit orientated. 5% of the total fund 
will be set aside to re-imburse all expenses incurred in this course of this 
transaction. This transfer will automatically be affected within 7 working 
days.

Be rest assured that with the underground work i have laid so far,that this 
transaction carries no risk and no extra burdens on your part, except the 
above mentioned nominal roles you are required to fulfill and similarly will 
be required to maintain absolute information secrecy throughout the duration
of this transaction,because discussing and exhibiting it with a third party 
might jeopardise the entire transaction.

I will give you directives and all needed information as soon as I receive 
your positive response. Kindly understand that we could not carry out this 
fund-transfer on our own, based on the simple facts that we are civil 
servants and presently bank staffs and this office excludes us from 
operating foreign accounts,moreover,conducting such magnanimous transaction 
from the same place where we belong to/coming from will raise eyebrows on 
our side and the truth is that this fund belongs to a foreigner,and as such 
demands same as next of kin.

I am looking forward to receiving your interesting response on this project 
as this will greatly enrich the both of us at the end.

Best Regards,
MR ZUMA BARLEY

MR SHAKIR ABDUL <shakir_abdul1@rediffmail.com>,,"Tue, 01 Feb 2005 15:02:36 +0400",DEAR FREIND,"
FROM MR. SHAKIR ABDUL  
DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF 
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS UNIT,
FOREIGN REMIITANCE DEPT.
OF AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB)
EAST AFRICA.


                     STRICTLY PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL.   
       


With due respect, I am Mr. SHAKIR ABDUL,the director in charge of audit 
and accounts unit,foreign remittance dept.of the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT 
BANK (ADB),TANZANIA IN EAST AFRICA. I decided to contact 
you for a beneficial and risk-free business transaction.

During our auditing and investigations in this bank,my department came 

across the sum of (US$35,000,000.00) THIRTY-FIVE-MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS ONLY, belonging to an international business man who 
died along with his family on the 31st October 1999 in a plane crash, 
in an Egyptian airline ( Egypt- Air) 990 - with other passengers on board. 
You can confirm this from the website below which was published by 
CNN.WEBSITE.http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/03/21/ntsb.egypt.air/index.html
OR www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200111/langewiesche .

Before our discovery of this development, there was no trace of claim 
from
any person as the fund remains dormant in his account with this bank. 
Although
I keep this information secret whitin my jurisdiction to enable us put 
claims
and transfer the said amount through a trustworthy friend overseas whom
we shall indirectly present to the bank as the bonafide next-of-kin to 
the deceased for a profitable and successful transaction - Because 
after five
years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account 
as unclaimed
bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it is 
on this note that i decided to seek for a foreign assistance whom his 
name shall be 
used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to
share this money amongst them at the end of the year.

Meanwhile, all the arrangments/documents to put claims as the bonafide 
next-of-kin to the deceased,to get the required approval and transfer 
of
this money to a foreign account has been put in place.The directives 
and
the needed informations will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate 
your
interest and willingness to cooperate fully.Infact, we could have done
this alone but because as civil servants we are not legally allowed to 
operate foreign account in our country and it would eventually raise 
an eyebrow on our side during the time of transfer because we are 
staffs of the bank.These are the actual reasons why it requires a 
second-fellow who will forward claims by our indirect support
as the bonafide next-of-kin.And also present a foreign bank account
(Old or New account)where the money will be transfered into.

On conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the 
total sum as gratification, 5% of the total sum will be set aside for 
contingency,while 70% will be for me and my partners here.
Please you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in 
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this with 
you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until 
you confirm the money in your account,We then come down to your country
for subsequent sharing of the fund according to the percentages 
indicated above, and for investment purpose like in any country you 
may as well advise us professionally on how to invest the money.
All other necessary informations will be sent to you when i receive 
an email response from you or a telephone call.

Pls. You can mail me anytime via the above email address for 
confidential purpose.

Expecting your urgent response.   

Yours Sincerely,

SHAKIR ABDUL.

Yetunde Bassey <yet_bassey@123.com>,yet_bassey@123.com,,PROJECT INTEREST.,"

My dear friend, 

I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger  Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger  Scott died from an 
automobile accident. 

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger  Scott did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger  Scott that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

DR. Yetunde Bassey

You may be surprise to receive this email since you do not know me. 
I am the son of the late president of Democratic Republic Of Zaire, 
President Mobutu Sese Seko, ( now The Republic of Congo, under the 
leadership of the son of Mr. Laurent Kabila). I presume you are aware there 
is a financial dispute between my family ( THEMOBUTUS ) and the present 
civilian Government. This is based on what they believe as bad and corrupt 
governance on my late father's part. May his soul rest in perfect peace. As 
you might have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in Switzerland 
and North America have been frozen. Following the above named reasons, I am 
soliciting for your humble and confidential assistance to take custody of 
THIRTY Million United States Dollars ( US$30,000,000.00 ), also to front for 
me in the areas of business you desire profitable.

Company, where it can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended 
beneficiary. The funds will be released to you by the Security Company, 
based on my recommendations, on that note, you will be presented as my 
partner who will be fronting for me and my family in any subsequent 
ventures. Myself and my mother have decided to give 20% to you if you are

james howard <stjames@teenmail.co.za>,,"Wed, 23 Mar 2005 02:06:08 +0200",God Bless!!,"Dear friend,

Greetings to you in the name of our heavenly God.
This mail might come to you as a surprise and the
temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into
your mind; but please, consider it a divine wish and
accept it with a deep sense of humility. My name is
JAMES HOWARD. I`m a 55 years old man. I am British
living in Dubai (United Arab Emirate). I was a
merchant and owned two businesses in Dubai. I was
also married with two children. My wife and two
children died in a car accident six years ago.
Before this happened my business and concern for
making money was all I lived for. I never really
cared about other values in life. But since the loss
of my family, I have found a new desire to assist
helpless families. I have been helping orphans in
orphanage/ motherless homes. I have donated some
money to orphans in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon,
Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian
countries. ! Before I became ill, I kept $15 Million
in a long-term deposit account in a finance
company . Presently, I?m in a
hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for
oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to
talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a
few months to live. It is my last wish to see this
money distributed to charity organizations. Because
relatives and friends have plundered so much of my
wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the
agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any
of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to
help me collect the deposit and the interest accrued
from the company and distributes it
amongst charity organizations. Use your judgement to
distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself
when you have the money for any cost you
incur during the process of collecting and
distributing the money to charity organizations. .
I?m willing to offer you a ! reward If you are willing
to help; please reply as soon as you can. May the
good Lord bless you and your family.

Regards,

James Howard
